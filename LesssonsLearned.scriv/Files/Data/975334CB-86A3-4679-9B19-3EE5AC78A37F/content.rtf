\f0\fs22 \cf0 People have already had some familiarity with the topics of concern with GMOs. Some of these questions are magnified with gene drives:\
1. Uncertainty: this is even more of an issue with gene drive due to the novelty of the approach. This is where the technology can be vulnerable.\
2. Irreversibility: the concerns with GMOs are now more powerful due to the perceived potential for irreversibility.\
3. Scientists who are involved with the development of the technology are genuinely concerned. This could be used as a negative, but could also be turned into a positive\'97show that scientists are serious about the risks and also that they are engaged in designing safeguards, such as multi-component drives, reverse drives, more accurate Cas9, etc.}
