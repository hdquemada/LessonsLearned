\f0\fs22 \cf0 Crops that have been genetically engineered or genetically modified (GM) have been in commercial production for 24 years, since the planting of the first GM soybean crop in 1996. As of 2018, 26 countries grew 192 million hectares of GM crops, with the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India growing the vast majority of that area. In addition to these countries, 44 are importing GM crop products. In Argentina,

\f0 18 million hectares of GM soy, 5.5 million hectares of GM maize, and 0.37 million hectares of cotton were planted in 2018, at at adoption rate (relative to total crop area) of 99% for GM soy, 97% for GM maize, and 93% for GM cotton \{ | ISAAA, 2018 | | |zu:5334702:QDQ4ENZ7\}. In the United States, GM corn accounted for 92%, GM soybeans 94%, and GM cotton 96% of the acreage  planted in 2020 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/47649/alltables.xls?v=6605.8"}}{\fldrslt

\cf0 This level of adoption throughout the world has resulted in significant socio-economic, health and environmental benefits. In 2018, farm income worldwide from GM crops was US$18.95 billion, with a cumulative total income of US$ 225 billion, with half of that income earned by developing country farmers \{ | Brookes, & Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:88XJI3UF\}. The 2018 annual farm income is equivalent to the Gross Domestic Product of many African countries {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD"}}{\fldrslt

 \{ | Brookes, & Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY\}. This reduction has direct benefits in terms of reducing farmer pesticide poisonings, as has been reported for China, India, Pakistan and South Africa (see Smyth \{ | -Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M\}, and references therein). For insect resistant maize, human health benefits are also inferred by the reduction levels of mycotoxins, which are toxic\'97causing neural tube defects\'97and carcinogenic \{ | Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M\}. These effects are particularly beneficial in those developing countries where maize is the staple food. Environmental benefits are also implied to be the result of reduction in pesticide use, through the known impacts of these pesticides on wildlife \{ | Brookes & Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY\}\{ | Siegrist & Hartmann, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:WCDRBP8C\}.}
