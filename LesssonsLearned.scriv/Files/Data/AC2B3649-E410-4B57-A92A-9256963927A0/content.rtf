\f0\fs22 \cf0 Crops that have been genetically engineered or genetically modified (GM) have been in commercial production for 24 years, since the planting of the first GM soybean crop in 1996. As of 2018, 26 countries grew 192 million hectares of GM crops, with the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India growing the vast majority of that area. In addition to these countries, 44 are importing GM crop products (\{ | ISAAA, 2018 | | |zu:5334702:QDQ4ENZ7\}).\
This level of adoption throughout the world has resulted in significant socio-economic and environmental benefits (\{ | Brookes, & Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:2CQHPIIA\}).\
