\f0\fs22 \cf0 # Summary of lessons learned for FNIH team\
\
- Scientists did not realize that the public views risk very differently from them.\
\
    \{ | Burke, 2004 | | |zu:5334702:4YSATCWJ\}\
\
- Public perceptions shaped by the first products introduced \{ | Bruce, 2017 | | |zu:5334702:RT9I8D7F\}. Easier to categorize as unnatural those modifications that do not have a counterpart in nature.\
    - In Europe, the first products were introduced by Monsanto: American, multinational, no engagement \{ | Fil Randazzo, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:9XGHL362\}\
- Lack of understanding of biotechnology by the consuming public \{ | Bazuin, et al., 2011 | | |zu:5334702:HBJNNJCW\}\
- NGOs have also been very skillful about their messaging. \{ | Burke, 2004 | | |zu:5334702:4YSATCWJ\}\
    - General perception that GM crops are inherently unsafe \{ | Dawe, & Unnevehr, 2007 | | |zu:5334702:T3LUJIYU\}\
    - Technologies targeted for the poor make them guinea pigs \{ | Dawe, & Unnevehr, 2007 | | |zu:5334702:T3LUJIYU\}\
    - NGOs found messages that resonated and were able to turn them into an economic engine \{ | Fil Randazzo, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:9XGHL362\}\
- The benefits of the technology were not obvious to the average consumer.\
\
    \{ | Burke, 2004 | | |zu:5334702:4YSATCWJ\}\
\
    - Production benefits less acceptable to the public (e.g. in animals, animal welfare benefits are more acceptable \{ | Bruce, 2017 | | |zu:5334702:RT9I8D7F\}). Animal welfare benefit might be also less obvious to the general public. Disease resistance seen as a welfare benefit while more musculature more connected to poor welfare.\
- Since there was not compelling reason to support the technology, the easiest course of action was to be precautionary.\
\
    \{ | Burke, 2004 | | |zu:5334702:4YSATCWJ\}\
\
    \{ | Reynolds, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:H8F5UUS3\}\
\
- Scientists are more active in supporting gene drives\
\
    \{ | Reynolds, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:H8F5UUS3\}\
\
- Environmental organizations do not oppose or are involved in gene drive research\
\
    \{ | Reynolds, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:H8F5UUS3\}\
\
- Agriculture perceived as a biodiversity threat\'97intensifying agriculture increases that threat\
\
    \{ | Reynolds, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:H8F5UUS3\}\
\
- Private sector involved in agricultural GMOs (see above regarding Monsanto)\
\
    \{ | Reynolds, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:H8F5UUS3\}\
\
    - Agrochemical company involvement might have been a disadvantage. \{ | Bruce, 2017 | | |zu:5334702:RT9I8D7F\} argues that if seed companies had been the ones to develop GM crops the situation might have been different.\
    - Intellectual property owned by multinationals\
\
        \{ | Dawe, & Unnevehr, 2007 | | |zu:5334702:T3LUJIYU\}\
\
        \{ | Bazuin, et al., 2011 | | |zu:5334702:HBJNNJCW\}\
\
- US government promotion of GM crops\
\
    \{ | Bazuin, et al., 2011 | | |zu:5334702:HBJNNJCW\}\
\
- Opposition to GM crops in African countries due to jeopardizing European markets\
\
    \{ | Reynolds, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:H8F5UUS3\}\
\
- General opposition to agricultural intensification and technology\
    - Opposition to Green Revolution\
\
        \{ | Dawe, & Unnevehr, 2007 | | |zu:5334702:T3LUJIYU\}\
\
        - Green Revolution not as successful in Africa\
\
            \{ | Bazuin, et al., 2011 | | |zu:5334702:HBJNNJCW\}\
\
    - Need for infrastructure to deploy and provide access to products (benefits)\
\
        \{ | Bazuin, et al., 2011 | | |zu:5334702:HBJNNJCW\}\
\
- Political and socio-economic considerations may affect outcomes (i.e. unexpected factors may present a barrier)\
\
    \{ | Bazuin, et al., 2011 | | |zu:5334702:HBJNNJCW\}\
\
- Science communication\
    - Study conducted in Japan \{ | Farid, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:XQKBNJJS\}

\f0\fs22 \
        - Science communication is the main factor that can affect willingness to purchase and the success of genetically edited food products in the market (Japan)

\f0\fs22 \
        - Consumers trust the information and regulations of governments\
    - Need a consistent, easily digestible message across research groups and other actors in this space\'97communicate the science in brief (30 sec. - 1 minute) videos \{ | Fil Randazzo, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:9XGHL362\}}
