\f0\fs22 \cf0 In 2002, Southern Africa (\cf2 Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Lesotho)\cf0  faced a food crisis \{ | Huffman et al., 2003 | | |zu:5334702:R3839H27\}\{ | Zerbe, 2004 | | |zu:5334702:6NV9SJNL\}\{ | Dorward & Kydd, 2004 | | |zu:5334702:VHXWK3TG\}. More than 15 million people were \'93dangerously hungry\'94, and 3 million faced starvation due to a number of factors, including climate (leading to drought), HIV/AIDS, structural adjustment, debt, collapsing public services, and poor governance \{ | Huffman et al. 2003 | | |zu:5334702:R3839H27\}\{ | Zerbe, 2004 | | |zu:5334702:6NV9SJNL\}. Despite this crisis, these six nations rejected food aid in the form of maize (a staple crop in that region) because the maize, from the United States, was genetically modified (GM).}
