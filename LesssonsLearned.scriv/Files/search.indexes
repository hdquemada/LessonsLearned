            <Text>The development of genetically engineered gene drives offers a range of new applications of genetic modification (GM) technology that has not been readily achievable with this technology to date. For current applications of GM technology, through the introduction of genes into various organisms, the ability to increase the frequency of transgenes in a population has been achieved mainly through the deliberate crossing of individuals with the gene of interest into desired genetic backgrounds through controlled breeding. This method has been employed primarily with GM crops, where it has been the means by which cultivars and hybrids for deployment to farmers have been produced. Informal selective breeding could also be the means by which desirable genes could be propagated throughout landraces or other cultivars maintained by subsistence farmers. The ability to increase frequencies of a desired transgene in natural populations has been limited, with the theoretical possibility of increase in gene frequency due to a selective advantage conferred by the transgene. This mechanism would be the means by which a disease resistance gene could be deployed in an endangered uncultivated species, such as the American chestnuthttps://www.une.edu/news/2019/thomas-klaks-project-restore-american-chestnut-tree-featured-news-center-maines-207. Gene drives offer a more efficient process for increasing gene frequencies in populations through a more rapid conversion of alleles.
The application of gene drives to achieve public health goals, such as the suppression of Anopheles gambiae populations or altering the species’ ability to sustain Plasmodium spp. infections, has received much attention from researchers, and if successful, can contribute much to the wellbeing of people in regions severely affected by malaria. However, gene drives are a product of genetic modification, and the experience to date, gained through the deployment of GM crops, is that GM technology has had difficulty being accepted. Even in cases where a public health benefit is the goal, such as in the case of GM mosquitoes engineered for control of Aedes egypti populations,  public acceptance has been mixed, with deployment allowed and accepted in Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands, but resisted in the United States { | Trump, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:G2TT9RKH}. In the case of GM Anopheles gambiae, tests of GM male sterile mosquitoes received criticism from opposition groups { | Cisnetto &amp; Barlow, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:TDWHKB5J}. It is possible that the experience with GM crops has laid the foundation for the current resistance to other GM technologies, and it is therefore useful to examine that experience to determine if any lessons learned it could be used to improve the probability of regulatory approval, and more importantly, of public acceptance of GM mosquitoes with gene drives.
This report will begin by surveying the status and history of GMO deployment throughout the world, to provide the background context for this subject. This history is actually the history of GM crop development and deployment, since very few GMOs have been deployed on the same scale, and in the environment (albeit managed rather than wild). Nevertheless, the amount of area over which GM crops have been deployed is at the same level as that which is anticipated for gene drive organisms. The report then describes the status of other GMOs that have been deployed for different fields of use, especially the experience with GM salmon and GM non-driving mosquitoes for control of arbovirus disease. The opposition to these GM products will then be described, followed by a review of analyses of the successes and failures in achieving public acceptance of these products. Finally, a synthesis of the lessons learned from the experience with these GM products will be presented.
In this report, GMOs will be considered to be those that have genes inserted through laboratory techniques. While organisms produced through gene editing might also be classified as GMOs in various jurisdictions, the experience with these organisms is not as extensive, and therefore will not be as useful a source of information. However, where relevant, information derived from experience with gene editing will be included.</Text>

Abstract
Better Dead than GM-Fed? Information and the Effects
of Consumers’ Resistance to GM-Foods in High Income Countries
This paper addressed the puzzling resistance of Presidents of southern African countries to food aid in 2002, given near certain starvation and long-term negative health effects of malnutrition of their constituents. First, I show that NGOs led by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are disseminating information claiming that GM foods are dangerous to human health and are “Frankenfoods.” Second, people in European Union countries, who are not in any danger of starvation, have strong preferences for non-GM foods, which they can easily afford. Over the long term, however, the tastes of EU consumers matter to southern African countries because some of these countries hope to export agricultural products in the future. GM-food aid, which most likely would contain GM-maize, is seen as a potential contaminant to native African maize varieties, and over the long term to be a threat to south African exports to the EU. Hence, understanding resistance to GM-food in developed countries is crucial to formulation of better food policies in Africa and to sustainable development.
New and important results are reported from a statistical analysis of the market characteristics that push consumers in a high-income country to resist GM foods, with an emphasis on negative information from environmental groups and third-party, verifiable information, which could neutralize misinformation. For this study, a unique sample of adult consumers participated in laboratory (random nth price) auctions of three food products where labeling and information treatments were randomly assigned to experimental units. A key finding is that negative GM-information supplied by environmental groups pushes some high income consumers out of the market for GM products and increases the probability that all consumers are out of the market. However, verifiable information dampens the effectiveness of negative GM-product information. Hence, a vocal interested source can stymie technology adoption in both rich and poor countries and increase the probability of general malnutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies and starvation and unsustainable development in poor countries because of the failure to accept food aid and adopt new GM technology.

Better Dead Than GM-Fed? Information and the Effects
of Consumers’ Resistance to GM-Foods in High-Income Countries
Southern Africa’s food crisis during 2001-2003 is set to be the worst in a decade. More than 15 million people have been dangerously hungry in Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Lesotho. In this region maize is the staple, and the recent drought and some bad public policies have reduced hungry people to eating wild leaves, berries, and scavenger foods (Economist’s Editors 2002). The recent drought, however, has been far less severe than in the earlier 1991-92 drought which was the worst that southern African has seen in modern times (Parlberg 2002).
One might expect that food aid would be welcome in these countries, but during the summer of 2002, the six above nations, which were most affected by the recent drought, rejected U.S. food aid because the corn earmarked for distribution contains genetic modification to resist insects. However, at the beginning of September 2002, the World Health Organization convinced the leaders of Lesotho, Malawi, and Swaziland to accept GM grains, but Zimbabwe and Mozambique have required that GM-containing grain can be imported only if it is sent from the port of entry to be milled. Milling, however, is costly and time consuming (Editor, Nature Biotechnology).
In Zambia, President Mwanawasa called American donations of maize “poison” and refused to import it, despite a warning from the UN World Food Program that relief supplies in his country would be exhausted by early October (Parlberg 2002; BBC News 2002). Up to three million people in Zambia face starvation.
Why are southern Africans wary of GM-food aid? These African governments refused GM corn because they feared that Europe will ban their agricultural exports if they become “contaminated” with transgenetic materials from bt corn. Although the EU
3

has not found any evidence that GM corn is unsafe, it has imposed a moratorium on the marketing approvals for GM crops based on the precautionary principle. This concept has encouraged regulators to ban new products or technologies on the suspicion that they could pose a treat to human health or the environment.
Although the main southern African agricultural exports to the EU have been animal products, not grains, and livestock products from GM fed materials are not affected by EU trade restrictions (Parlberg 2002), this fact has seemingly gone unnoticed by the leaders. The WHO and FAO have reaffirmed that it is “unlikely that GM food pose a risk to human health (Editor, Nature Biotechnology 2002).” Compared with the clear and immediate danger posed by the short and long-term effects of malnutrition and starvation (Fogel 1994), the possibilities of being poisoned by Frankenfood seem rather remote. Hence, short-term benefits to food aid certainly exceed the costs.
Consumers in the European Union countries, who are not in any danger of starvation, have strong preferences for non-GM foods or have displayed strong resistance to GM foods (Parlberg 2001, 2002; Johnson 2002). “Non-GM” is a quality attribute that high income consumers can easily afford. EU farmers will continue to prosper, thanks to lavish subsidies, and their consumers will remain well fed.1 In contrast, in southern Africa, roughly two-thirds of the population are farmers. An unusually large share are women, and they are poor and malnourished in part because they lack improved crop technologies to battle against drought, poor soil fertility, crop diseases, and insect problems.2 They are not only short of food in general but also micronutrient deficiencies and face technical and economic constraints.3 New biotechnology products, e.g., see Johnson 2002, Qaim and Zilberman 2003, Binenbaum et al. 2003, could remedy this situation. However, the precautionary EU policies toward the environment are also
4

slowing technology transfer to Africa (Parlberg 2001).4 The EU has been insisting that governments in Africa treat GM crops as a potential serious threat to “biodiversity.” Over the long run, the tastes of EU consumers matter to southern African countries because historically Zambia, Zimbabwe, and some other countries have earned significant foreign exchange from agricultural exports to Europe. Any plausible threat to their exports has to be taken seriously.
GM-food aid is seen as such a threat because if some southern African farmers were to plant GM seeds from an aid shipment, e.g., even ones not crushed in the milling process, local maize varieties could be contaminated by pollen drift or physical mixing (BBC News 2002; Economist’s Editors 2002). Over time these farmers might not be able to convince European buyers that their maize is GM-free or livestock and poultry are fed non-GM feed. Although imports of GM foods are not barred from the European Union by law, NGOs, led by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, have lobbied and demonstrated effectively, creating fear, rage and skepticism about biotechnology, and thereby, making EU consumers wary of GM foods (Nestle 2002). They have also lobbied for labeling of GM food products (Greenpeace International 1997; Friends of the Earth 2001), but have also demonstrated heavily against GM-labeled foods whenever they appear in food stores. In this environment, EU consumers’ demand for GM foods has been insufficient for food stores and supermarkets to stock them (Economist’s Editors 2002).
Although GM testing is possible, it is far from complete and somewhat expensive. It is, however, of sufficient scientific merit to present potential problems and risks for farmers in poor countries who want to export. The fears of the high-income EU consumers are creating an obstacle to the acceptance of food aid by poor southern
5

African countries and also to new agricultural technologies built on biotechnology (Economist’s Editors 2002). These new technologies could reduce the cost of grain production in southern Africa and increase micronutrient content of farmer grown foods, which would make food more abundant and more nutritious over the long term, and reduce applications of commercial pesticides, improve environmental quality, and reduce the risks of pesticide contamination of agricultural workers (Johnson 2002; Qaim and Zilberman 2003).5 However, opposition to importing GM products by certain developed countries governments presents a major barrier to a developing country. Even if opposition does not result in a ban, it may impose conditions that developing countries cannot met or could only met a very high costs, e.g., identity preservation and traceability of products from farm to market (Johnson 2002). Understanding GM-food resistance in developed countries is central to better food policies in southern Africa and sustainable development.
European consumers have been far more critical of GM foods than U.S. consumers. There are several potential explanations for the divergence. One potential reason is that Europeans have had to deal with the BSE crisis (Mad-Cow disease) and other food scares recently that U.S. consumers have not encountered and that could explain why Europeans are more hesitant to accept new GM technology in food products (Gaskill, 2000). Some claim that Europeans have a strong preference for “natural” which may cause their resistance to GM technology (Zechendorf, 1998). It is important to understand why Europeans and others in high-income countries are so critical of GM foods, because their resistance to GM-technology is, in part, why many African countries are not accepting food aid.

This paper examines the market characteristics that push consumers in high income countries to resist GM foods, with an emphasis on negative information from environmental groups and third-party, verifiable information (see Huffman and Tegene 2002). For this study, unique data were collected from adult consumers in the United States who participated in laboratory auctions of three food types with randomly assigned labeling and information treatments. Using U.S. consumers is important because U.S. consumers are generally supportive of GM foods and free from the BSE “food scare” fears and bias towards “natural” that are hypothesized to lead Europeans to reject GM foods. Key findings are that negative GM-product information supplied by environmental groups pushes some consumers out of the market for GM products and increases the probability that all consumers are out of the market for GM-foods. Verifiable information dampens the effectiveness of negative GM-product information. An important finding is that negative information on GM foods from environmental groups, an interested source, can stymie technology adoption in both rich and poor countries, and increase the probability of malnutrition and starvation in poor countries because of both the failure to accept food aid and new GM-technology.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We develop a model of consumer demand for food which includes a time- invariant linear individual- and country-specific unobserved effect. By randomly assigning information treatments to experimental units, we can compare the before and after treatment effects. By differencing the data before model estimation we remove any linear time-invariant individual- or country-specific unobserved effect, and this method
7

leads to unbiased and consistent estimates of information treatment effects on the demand for GM-foods (Wooldridge 2002, pp. 299-314).
Consumers might react differently to GM content in different types of food or they might dislike some food products. Therefore using only one food item in a laboratory auction seemed unlikely to reveal enough information, given the sizeable fixed cost of conducting the experiment. Three food items were chosen for our willingness to pay (WTP) auctions: vegetable oil (made from soybeans), tortilla chips (made from yellow corn), and russet potatoes. In the distilling and refining process for vegetable oils, essentially all of the proteins (which are the components of DNA and the source of genetic modification) are removed leaving pure lipids. Minimal human health concerns should arise from GM oil, but consumers may either worry that GM soybeans affect the environment or lack adequate information on the distilling process. Tortilla chips are highly processed foods that may be made from GM or non-GM corn, and consumers might have human health and environmental concerns about this product. Russet potatoes are purchased as a fresh product and are generally fried or baked before eating. Similar to tortilla chips, consumers might see both human health and environmental risks from eating GM-russet potatoes.
We are interested in the effects of GM-food labels and information about GM- technology and products on consumer demand for food products that might be genetically modified. In our experiments, the two labels—GM and plain---were clearly displayed on the fronts of each food package (see figure 1). A one-page summary organized under five different headings—general information, scientific information, human impact, financial impact, and environmental impact-- was prepared for pro-GM information from Monsanto and Syngenta, large agribusiness companies; anti-GM
8

information from Greenpeace, a leading environmental group and NGO opposing genetic modification; and independent, third-party or verifiable information from informed but financially disinterested sources. See figure 2-4. This information was organized into six information treatments: pro-GM, anti-GM, pro-GM and anti-GM, pro-GM and verifiable, anti-GM and verifiable, and all three types. The six information treatments were randomly assigned to experimental units, which consisted of 12 to 16 individuals.
We follow standard experimental auction valuation procedures (Smith 1976; Shogren et al. 1994), but make refinements to the design to better reflect consumer purchases. A summary is presented here, and details are in Rousu et al. (2002). First, our subjects submitted only one bid per product. We have stepped back from the protocol of using multiple, repeated trials and posted market-clearing prices to avoid any question of creating affiliated values which can affect the demand-revealing nature of a Vickrey-style auction (List and Shogren 1999). Second, endowment effects are minimized. We do not endow our subjects with a food item and then ask them to “upgrade” to another food item because that methodology can cause distorted bid prices (see List and Schroeder 2002 or Corrigan and Rousu 2003). As is the trademark for economics experiments, subjects were paid a participation fee, $40. Instead of endowing participants with food and having them bid to “upgrade” to another food item, we asked participants to bid on food items in only two trials. This avoids the risk of an in-kind endowment effect and of any credit constraint. Third, consumers bid on three unrelated food items: vegetable oil, corn chips and russet potatoes. We can obtain useful information on their tastes for genetic modification even if a subject disliked one or two products. Fourth, treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units, and estimation of treatment effects is simply the difference in means across treatments (Wooldridge 2001). We also randomize within
9

treatments (e.g., order of pro- and anti-biotech information when an experimental unit received both types). Verifiable information, however, was always presented last.
Fifth, adult consumers over 18 years of age from two large metropolitan areas in the U.S. were chosen as participants by a random digit-dialing method. Although it is of secondary importance to the results that we obtain, the demographics of our sample taken from two major cities do not match perfectly the Census demographic characteristics for these two regions, they are similar and provide a sufficient representation for our probe into labeling and information effect on the demand for GM-products. (See Appendix A for means of attributes of survey areas). We use common food items available to shoppers in grocery stores and supermarkets, and prefer adults who are not primarily college students. Although Lusk and Schroeder (2002) and Fox et al. (2002) used college undergraduates in laboratory auctions of food items, students are not typical grocery store shoppers. They are 8.5 percent of shoppers versus 12.8 percent in the Census of Population. Katsaras et al. (2001) showed that women make up a disproportionate share of grocery store shoppers. A sample primarily of grocery store shoppers also weakens the sometimes-stated need for having students participate in several rounds of bidding to stabilize bids for food items and minimizes the Hawthorne effect in bidding (Melton et al. 1996), i.e., the methodology minimizes the chance that participants change their behavior only because they participate in an experiment with specific objectives.
Sixth, a Vickrey 2nd price auction is frequently used in WTP experiments, but it does not engage off the margin bidders. For new products, researchers are interested in the location of the completed demand curve—not just one segment. We use the random nth price auction which has the advantage that it is demand revealing in theory, and the auction attempts to engage bidders at all locations along the demand curve (Shogren et al.
10

2001). For example, each of k bidders submits a bid for one unit of a good; for instance, if the monitor randomly selects n = 5 &lt;= k, the four highest bidders each purchase one unit of the good priced at the fifth-highest bid. This random nth price auction increases the odds that insincere bidding will lead to a loss.
Finally, information from our laboratory experiments is complemented by information obtained from pre- and post-experiment questionnaires administered to participants. The pre-auction survey allowed us to obtain socio-demographic information and information on participants’ beliefs about GM and other technologies before treatment, which is useful to help explain bidder behavior. The post-auction questionnaire allowed us to obtain information from participants about sources they would trust to provide verifiable information, a concept introduced in the experiment.
The Model
The model is one of a consumer demand function for food containing an unobserved individual- and country-specific effect with information as one determinant of demand. The assumption is that negative information shifts a consumer’s demand function to the left or downward and verifiable information shifts it to the right or upward. The key hypotheses are: 1) Negative GM-information from NGOs increases the frequency of consumers “being out of the market” for one unit of a GM-food item and increases the probability of consumers being out of the market for all GM-food items, and 2) third-party, verifiable information dampens the effects of negative information on consumers. We define a consumer being “out of the market” for a GM-food item as occurring when s/he bids zero for one unit of GM-product (a strong test) or less than or equal to two-thirds their bid for plain-labeled product (a weaker test). .
11

If a consumer does not have a positive WTP for one unit of a GM food when he/she has a positive WTP for the non-GM counterpart, this suggests he/she would not consume the GM variety of the product at any price. Determining what affects the probability of being out of the market is important, because if the rate of consumers’ purchase of food items is too low, the grocery store will discontinue carrying, stocking, or supplying the food item. The weaker test assumes that a consumer is out of the market if the price an individual bids for the GM-labeled food is less than or equal to two-thirds of the price he/she bids for the plain-labeled food item. This weaker test captures the reality that premiums for non-GM foods generally do not exceed 20 percent (Kiesel et al. 2002).
The empirical evidence that we are looking for is contained in actual frequencies of consumer bids and probit models explaining the probability of a consumer being out of the market for one or more GM-food items (Wooldridge 2002). Although we have estimated probit models for each of the three products separately, we report only the evidence from joint outcomes for vegetable oil, tortilla chips, and russet potatoes.6
Results
First, we examine mean bids of participants. In table 2, part A, the mean bid prices for all participants are displayed. Consumers, on average, discounted GM-labeled foods by fourteen percent. Part B shows that participants who received only positive information actually put a premium on the GM-labeled food for two of the three products. This was despite the fact that the genetic modification was only used to enhance the production process, and did not give the foods any enhanced nutrient or food safety attributes. Part C shows that when consumers received only negative information,
12

they discount the GM-labeled foods by an average of approximately thirty-five percent. Part D shows that consumers who received both positive and negative information discount the GM-labeled foods by an average of seventeen to twenty-nine percent, depending on the food product.
Third-party information has an impact on the willingness to pay for GM-labeled foods. Part E shows that consumers who received positive and third-party information discounted GM-labeled foods slightly. This is in contrast to the consumers who received only positive information who valued the GM-labeled foods more than their plain-labeled counterpart on average. Part F shows that participants who received negative and third- party information still discounted the GM-labeled foods, but by a smaller amount than the participants who received only negative information. Part G shows that participants who received negative and third-party information discounted the GM-labeled foods by an average of seventeen to twenty-two percent, depending on the product. Participants who received positive, negative and third-party information were more accepting of the GM-labeled foods than those who received only positive and negative information. The participants who received positive, negative and third-party information discounted the GM-labeled food by an average of zero to eleven percent, depending on the product.
Our results are consistent with Viscusi (1997) who found that individuals placed a slightly greater weight on negative information than positive information. In our auction, participants who received only positive information did not discount the GM-labeled food, while those who received only negative information discounted the GM-labeled food by an average of 35 percent. Those who received both positive and negative information put slightly more weight on the negative information, discounting the GM- labeled foods by 20 percent. One explanation for the moderated effect (but not offset) of
13

negative information when participants received both positive and negative GM-product information is that some individuals have an asymmetric value function, giving greater weight to marginal losses than to gains (Kahneman and Tversky 1979).
Also, our results are in contrast to Fox et al.’s (2002) who obtained the result that negative information dominated positive information. They argued that one reason could be due to a “status quo bias,” (or endowment effect) where participants were originally endowed with a regular pork sandwich and could bid to upgrade to an irradiated pork sandwich. Participants may have their bids biased due to being endowed with one type of sandwich.7,8 Our auction had participants bid on items in separate rounds (trials). Thus our results are not influenced by a “status quo bias.”
Tables 3 and 4 display the percentages of participants who are out of the market for the GM-labeled commodities using both the strong and weak tests for being out of the market. The number of observations differs across products, because if an individual bids zero for both the GM-labeled and plain-labeled versions of a commodity, he/she is not included in the analysis (he/she did not demand the product, so we cannot determine his/her taste for genetic modification). Similarly, when reporting on who is out of the market for all GM-labeled foods, we do not include those who bid zero for all food products. Under both tests a significant share of participants—9 to 24 percent--are out of the market, but a lower share for vegetable oil than for tortilla chips and russet potatoes. This arises because verifiable information pointed out that distillation and refinement of oils leaves only lipids and no GM-containing proteins.
In Table 5 the dependent variable takes a one if a participant’s bid for all three GM-labeled-food item is 2/3rds or less than for the equivalent plain labeled food item. The reported results are estimated coefficients from probit models explaining the
14

probability that a participant is out of the market (weaker definition) for all GM-foods.9 The results in table 5 show that anti-biotech information increases significantly the probability that a consumer is out of the market for GM-food items, i.e., negative information pushes consumers out of the market. This result has important implications. If an NGO wishes to slow scientific progress, it could disseminate large amounts of negative information, even if the information is highly biased. With asymmetric information, it could even disguise true intentions by telling consumers it wants to keep them “fully informed” of the consequences of a product or technology, or to be very cautious until all the negative claims are disproved—the “precautionary principle.” Even if individuals do not fully believe the information, negative information will increase the uncertainty about a product or process, which has been shown to decrease the likelihood of adoption (Purvis et al. 1995). With a significant reduction in consumer demand, supermarket managers may discontinue carrying an item, which reduces consumers’ choices, and with a collapse in the market for the food item, farmers would discontinue using GM-technology. Given that technological change is one of the driving forces behind rising standards of living, stalling adoption of new goods broadly could lead to a significant reduction in future social welfare.
Table 5 shows that third-party, verifiable information decreases significantly the probability that consumers are out of the market for GM-labeled foods. This provides evidence that a third-party source that provides neutral, verifiable information on genetic modification and GM-foods could prevent markets for GM-foods from collapsing. In addition to the value verifiable information has by providing consumers with objective information on the risks and benefits of genetic modification (estimated in Rousu et al.
15

(2002) at $2.6 billion), verifiable information can increase the number of real options that consumers have in supermarkets.
Other results are that pro-biotech information also reduces the probability of consumers’ being out of the market for GM-food products. Although the ag biotech- industry perspective frequently gets bad press, our results imply that it can also reduce the probability of consumers being out of the market for GM-labeled foods. In addition, consumers’ pre-experiment beliefs are important factors for understanding the demand for GM-labeled foods. When a participant reported in our pre-experiment questionnaire that s/he was informed about GM-technology and products, s/he had a significantly higher probability of being out of the market for GM-foods (see table 5, model 8).
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
This paper has provided new insights into and empirical evidence on factors affecting resistance to new products by consumers in a high income country. Our evidence is derived from unique data. We applied a sound statistical experimental design which randomly assigned labeling and information treatments to experimental units of adult consumers who participated in laboratory auction experiments of three food items that might be genetically modified. These were U.S. consumers who were free from the confounding effects such as experiencing the BSE crisis, Dioxin scandal, or having a predisposition towards “natural foods” that are present in European consumers. We find several important results. First, when participants saw GM-labeled foods rather than plain-labeled foods, a significant share-- 9 to 24 percent-- were pushed out of the market for GM-food. Second, when participants received negative GM-information from environmental groups, they had a significantly higher probability of being out of the market for GM-labeled food items. Third, third-party verifiable information dissipates
16

partially the effects of negative GM-information. Verifiable information can be an effective policy tool to moderate resistance to new products and to keep new food products as options in supermarkets, thereby increasing consumers’ range of choices.
Our results present an alternative explanation for Europeans’ negligible demand for GM foods. Many have hypothesized that European’s dislike for GM-foods originated in food scares such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and foot and mouth disease in the UK, and dioxin in Belgium. An alternative interpretation of Europeans’ low demand for GM-products is that NGOs, largely Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, have been more prevalent there than in the US, disseminating larger amounts of negative GM-information, creating skepticism and doubt about GM technology, and that no trusted source of verifiable information exists.
Human malnutrition and starvation and sustainable development in southern Africa are related to the resistance to GM-foods in the EU, and the resistance to GMOs in developed countries can be explained, at least in part, by the dissemination of negative GM-production information and demonstrating against these products by NGOs. Future research could actually conduct GM-auction experiments in the EU. But in the mean time, the plight of southern Africa rests to some extent on changing food and agricultural trade policies of the rich countries. One such policy would be to establish and fund a new institution having as its objective to produce and distribute verifiable information on GM technology. This information would dissipate impacts of unduly negative antibiotech information being distributed by NGOs.

Figure 2. Information given to participants. Anti-biotechnology Information
The following is a collection of statements and information on genetic modification from Greenpeace, a leading environmental group.
General Information
Genetic modification is one of the most dangerous things being done to your food sources today. There are many reasons that genetically modified foods should be banned, mainly because unknown adverse effects could be catastrophic! Inadequate safety testing of GM plants, animals, and food products has occurred, so humans are the ones testing whether or not GM foods are safe. Consumers should not have to test new food products to ensure that they are safe.
Scientific Impact
The process of genetic modification takes genes from one organism and puts them into another. This process is very risky. The biggest potential hazard of genetically modified (GM) foods is the unknown. This is a relatively new technique, and no one can guarantee that consumers will not be harmed. Recently, many governments in Europe assured consumers that there would be no harm to consumers over mad-cow disease, but unfortunately, their claims were wrong. We do not want consumers to be harmed by GM food.
Human Impact
Genetically modified foods could pose major health problems. The potential exists for allergens to be transferred to a GM food product that no one would suspect. For example, if genes from a peanut were transferred into a tomato, and someone who is allergic to peanuts eats this new tomato, they could display a peanut allergy.
Another problem with genetically modified foods is a moral issue. These foods are taking genes from one living organism and transplanting them into another. Many people think it is morally wrong to mess around with life forms on such a fundamental level.
Financial Impact
GM foods are being pushed onto consumers by big businesses, which care only about their own profits and ignore possible negative side effects. These groups are actually patenting different life forms that they genetically modify, with plans to sell them in the future. Studies have also shown that GM crops may get lower yields than conventional crops.
Environmental Impact
Genetically modified foods could pose major environmental hazards. Sparse testing of GM plants for environmental impacts has occurred. One potential hazard could be the impact of GM crops on wildlife. One study showed that one type of GM plant killed Monarch butterflies.
Another potential environmental hazard could come from pests that begin to resist GM plants that were engineered to reduce chemical pesticide application. The harmful insects and other pests that get exposed to these crops could quickly develop tolerance and wipe out many of the potential advantages of GM pest resistance.
      23

Figure 3. Information given to participants, pro-biotechnology information
The following is collection of statements and information on genetic modification provided by a group of leading biotechnology companies, including Monsanto and Syngenta.
General Information
Genetically modified plants and animals have the potential to be one of the greatest discoveries in the history of farming. Improvements in crops so far relate to improved insect and disease resistance and weed control. These improvements using bioengineering/GM technology lead to reduced cost of food production. Future GM food products may have health benefits.
Scientific Impact
Genetic modification is a technique that has been used to produce food products that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Genetic engineering has brought new opportunities to farmers for pest control and in the future will provide consumers with nutrient enhanced foods. GM plants and animals have the potential to be the single greatest discovery in the history of agriculture. We have just seen the tip of the iceberg of future potential.
Human Impact
The health benefits from genetic modification can be enormous. A special type of rice called “golden rice” has already been created which has higher levels of vitamin A. This could be very helpful because the disease Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) is devastating in third-world countries. VAD causes irreversible blindness in over 500,000 children, and is also responsible for over one million deaths annually. Since rice is the staple food in the diets of millions of people in the third world, Golden Rice has the potential of improving millions of lives a year by reducing the cases of VAD.
The FDA has approved GM food for human consumption, and Americans have been consuming GM foods for years. While every food product may pose risks, there has never been a documented case of a person getting sick from GM food.
Financial Impact
Genetically modified plants have reduced the cost of food production, which means lower food prices, and that can help feed the world. In America, lower food prices help decrease the number of hungry people and also lets consumers save a little more money on food. Worldwide the number of hungry people has been declining, but increased crop production using GM technology can also help further reduce world hunger.
Environmental Impact
GM technology has produced new methods of insect control that reduce chemical insecticide application by 50 percent or more. This means less environmental damage. GM weed control is providing new methods to control weeds, which are a special problem in no-till farming. Genetic modification of plants has the potential to be one of the most environmentally helpful discoveries ever.
      24

Figure 4. Information given to participants, independent, verifiable information
The following is a statement on genetic modification approved by a third-party group, consisting of a variety of individuals knowledgeable about genetically modified foods, including scientists, professionals, religious leaders, and academics. These parties have no financial stake in genetically modified foods.
General Information
Bioengineering is a type of genetic modification where genes are transferred across plants or animals, a process that would not otherwise occur (In common usage, genetic modification means bioengineering). With bioengineered pest resistance in plants, the process is somewhat similar to the process of how a flu shot works in the human body. Flu shots work by injecting a virus into the body to help make a human body more resistant to the flu. Bioengineered plant- pest resistance causes a plant to enhance its own pest resistance.
Scientific Impact
The Food and Drug Administration standards for GM food products (chips, cereals, potatoes, etc.) is based on the principle that they have essentially the same ingredients, although they have been modified slightly from the original plant materials.
Oils made from bioengineered oil crops have been refined, and this process removed essentially all the GM proteins, making them like non-GM oils. So even if GM crops were deemed to be harmful for human consumption, it is doubtful that vegetable oils would cause harm.
Human Impact
While many genetically modified foods are in the process of being put on your grocers’ shelf, there are currently no foods available in the U.S. where genetic modification has increased nutrient content. All foods present a small risk of an allergic reaction to some people. No FDA approved GM food poses any known unique human health risks.
Financial Impact
Genetically modified seeds and other organisms are produced by businesses that seek profits. For farmers to switch to GM crops, they must see benefits from the switch. However, genetic modification technology may lead to changes in the organization of the agri-business industry and farming. The introduction of GM foods has the potential to decrease the prices to consumers for groceries.
Environmental Impact
The effects of genetic modification on the environment are largely unknown. Bioengineered insect resistance has reduced farmers’ applications of environmentally hazardous insecticides. More studies are occurring to help assess the impact of bioengineered plants and organisms on the environment. A couple of studies reported harm to Monarch butterflies from GM crops, but other scientists were not able to recreate the results. The possibility of insects growing resistant to GM crops is a legitimate concern.

ENDNOTES
1 Historically, some low risk technologies have been resisted with accompanying large death toll. In the United States, opposition to pasteurization of milk at the beginning of the twentieth century was widespread, with opponents saying, among other things, that pasteurization was not needed and that consumers had the “right to drink raw milk” (Hotchkiss 2002). Pirtle (1926 ) notes that the slow adoption of pasteurization resulted in thousands of deaths that could have been prevented. Also, over the past ten years an unusually large amount of consumer resistance has existed to irradiated meat and poultry, which essentially eliminates harmful bacteria like e-coli and salmonella (Nestle 2002; Fox 2002). This resistance has caused a significant number of annual deaths that were preventable at small marginal cost.
2 Southern Africa, which has limited rainfall and irrigation water and medium to unfavorable soils, was largely bypassed by Green Revolution Technology (Johnson 2002).
3 Micronutrient deficiencies are a serious problem when farm households depend on food that the family produces themselves (Johnson 2002). In developed countries, farm family purchase milk, flour, juices, and breakfast cereal from grocery stores that are fortified with micronutrients.
4 Binenbaum et al. 2003 emphasize that international and national agricultural research centers have far greater freedom currently to operate in agricultural research oriented toward food crops for the developing world than is commonly perceived. They are generally able to operate in regions where most modern technologies are unprotected by IPRs. They emphasize that unlicensed production in developing countries of crops protected only in the developed countries is both legal and moral per se.
5 The precautionary principle as applied by opponents to GMOs looks at only the potential harmful effects while ignoring real benefits that currently would occur to the producers/farmers (Parlberg 2001; Johnson 2002).

7 Recall that our participants are only given money and no physical commodity, and this minimizes the endowment effects.
8 Another difference is that our anti-biotech information mentioned only minor human health hazards from consuming GM foods, e.g., allergies. In contrast in the irradiated meat experiment, the negative information included the possibility of getting cancer and dieing.

abstract
Burkina Faso’s 2008 Bt cotton adoption was Africa’s largest genetically modified (GM) crop introduction principally for small farmers, and became its most celebrated success story. In 2016, however, Burkina Faso announced an abrupt phase-out of Bt cotton, citing millions of dollars of losses due to inferior lint quality. In hindsight, quality issues were conspicuously absent from the success narrative, particularly given that cotton sector actors were aware of problems for a decade. Recent data also reveal significantly lower yield gains and substantial inequalities between farmers, further questioning the success story and the evaluation literature it relied upon. Why and how was such a faulty and incomplete success narrative produced and promoted? To answer this, we draw on extended fieldwork conducted over ten years in Burkina Faso to critically examine how the knowledge used to build this success narrative was produced. We first scrutinize the evaluation literature, pointing out flaws and blindspots in the methodologies and reporting of findings. We then extend our analysis, drawing on political ecology and critical science stud- ies, to focus on the power relations of knowledge production. We focus on three themes and show how (1) the political economic context favored the production of positive results, with Monsanto holding sub- stantial power over the evaluation process, (2) the narrow epistemologies of agronomic evaluation pro- duced ‘‘apolitical” knowledge that overlooked how local-level power dynamics shaped data collection, and – in at least two cases (fertilizer application rates and seed costs) – the returns accrued by smaller-scale Bt cotton farmers, (3) the knowledge produced via these processes was used to accrue material benefits to Monsanto and helped to promote GM crops across the continent. We conclude that future GM crop evaluations should be more self-reflexive, critical, and transparent in how power shapes the evaluation process and agricultural outcomes for differentiated farmers.
    In 2008, Burkina Faso became the first African nation to com- mercially introduce a genetically modified (GM) crop to a signifi- cant number of smallholder farmers. Bt cotton, which provides insect resistance, was widely embraced by the Burkinabè cotton sector under the promise that it would increase yields and incomes, and boost overall cotton sector profitability and ‘‘compet- itivity.” Quite rapidly, Bt cotton was framed as a success story. Pro- ponents of a ‘‘Gene Revolution” for Africa extolled Burkina Faso’s rapid entry into the ranks of ‘‘biotech mega-countries” (James, 2009). With glowing reports of widespread Bt cotton adoption, ris- ing yields, increased farmer incomes, and efficient pest control (James, 2010; Pertry et al., 2016), Burkina Faso was held up as an example for other African countries to emulate, and as evidence

of the unequivocal benefits of GM crops for African smallholder farmers (ISAAA, 2010).
It thus came as an abrupt surprise to many when Burkina Faso’s cotton sector announced in early April 2016 that it would end Bt cotton production and return to ‘‘100% conventional” cotton (L’Economiste du Faso, 2016). The Inter-Professional Cotton Associ- ation of Burkina Faso (AICB, 2015), an umbrella group that consists of Burkinabè cotton companies and the cotton producers’ union, explained that Bt cotton had inferior quality characteristics which had resulted in major economic losses for the cotton companies. They reported a lower ginning ratio and a shorter fiber length than conventional Burkinabè cotton varieties. Whereas long-fiber con- ventional cotton had previously attracted a price premium and eager buyers on the international market, Burkinabè cotton com- panies were struggling to sell their shorter fiber Bt cotton. They reported economic losses of 48 billion CFA francs (roughly US$76 million), and sought compensation from Monsanto, the U.S. com- pany that had provided the Bt technology (Bavier, 2017).

Burkina Faso’s abrupt reversal on Bt cotton was surprising to many, given the widely promoted success narrative. Problems and discrepancies with Bt cotton, however, were apparent to those inside the cotton sector well before 2016. Burkinabè cotton sector officials and Monsanto executives were concerned about lint qual- ity and fiber length issues since 2006. Furthermore, aggregate cot- ton sector data revealed significantly lower average yield improvements (13%) associated with Bt cotton than the numbers cited in the peer-reviewed scientific literature and used in calculat- ing royalty payments for Monsanto (30%) (AICB, 2015). This large discrepancy in yield gains – and recent findings of major inequal- ities between poorer and wealthier farmers in how they benefited from Bt cotton (Sanou et al., 2018; Vognan &amp; Fok, 2019) – raise important questions about how yield data were generated, ana- lyzed, and reported in the Bt cotton evaluation literature. While lint quality issues led Burkina Faso to end Bt cotton production, both quality and yield issues indicate problems with the broader success narrative, which was either silent despite existing knowl- edge (on quality issues) or later found to be inaccurate (on yields and the distribution of benefits). We find it particularly puzzling that many problems were known about or suspected for many years yet were absent from the evaluation literature that pro- claimed Bt cotton in Burkina Faso as a success. How and why was such a faulty and incomplete narrative produced and promoted?
The research presented in this article focuses on the power rela- tions of knowledge production as a way to understand the creation and endurance of Burkina Faso’s Bt cotton success narrative. The case of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso is particularly significant, as it was not only a highly visible pioneer of GM crop commercializa- tion in Africa, but also one of the only cases worldwide of a major reversal in GM crop production. Examining the production, and the surprising persistence, of the success narrative surrounding this case holds lessons for how to understand and assess GM crop development in Africa.
We begin by situating our work in a broader political ecology literature which explores the relationship between different forms of power and knowledge production in relation to GM crops. We then examine methodological and conceptual issues in the Bt cot- ton evaluation literature in Burkina Faso, pointing to the need for a deeper analysis of how material interests and unequal relation- ships between actors shaped, or were overlooked in, the produc- tion of knowledge. We examine the power / knowledge production nexus in three parts. First, we analyze the political economy of knowledge production, exposing important conflicts of interest, which help to explain key silences in the reporting of problems. Second, we examine how the resulting evaluation liter- ature was ‘‘apolitical,” meaning that it ignored how local-level power relations shaped both data collection and Bt cotton out- comes for cotton producers. Many of the glaring oversights in the success narrative resulted from a failure to recognize how relation- ships between farmers and cotton company employees can dra- matically affect farmers’ seed costs, fertilizer use, and consequent farm outcomes. Third, we examine how this apolitical knowledge production process served to reproduce uneven material benefits in favor of the biotech industry in Africa. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for ongoing GM crop debates in Africa and beyond.
1. Knowledge politics, success narratives, and GM crops
In the contemporary moment of ‘‘post-truth” politics, in which deconstructionist logics have been deployed to question all kinds of truth claims, many scientists – including those who study GM crops – have sought to defend the idea of neutral, disinterested,
and apolitical science. Yet part of the practice of science is contin- uous scrutiny of scientific knowledge. Neimark et al. (2019) argue for the renewed importance of careful social scientific study of the relationships between power and the production of knowledge. They note that ‘‘foregrounding (once again) these relationships between political power and truth claims makes it possible to clar- ify mechanisms of knowledge production and exclusion” (p. 3), allowing us to understand how ‘‘power constitutes, moves within, and reproduces socio-material relations to shape which knowl- edges, social relations, and practices (and corresponding ecologies) are hegemonic” (p. 4). In other words, despite impulses to circle the wagons in defense of apolitical science, critical social scientists must continue to illuminate and critically analyze the power-laden processes of knowledge production.
Since the post-structural turn in the 1990s, the field of political ecology has broadly examined linkages between power, discourse, and knowledge claims (Forsyth, 2013; Peet &amp; Watts, 2002; Robbins, 2012). Political ecologists and other critical social scien- tists have drawn from Foucault and poststructuralism to examine how the linkages of discourse and power shape our very parame- ters of thought and action. As in Bourdieu’s concepts of doxa and domination or Gramsci’s theory of hegemony (Burawoy &amp; Von Holdt, 2012), discourses or knowledge structures shape peoples’ assumptions, the models they use, and what comes to be consid- ered ‘‘truth.” Many scholars have interrogated how the production of certain kinds of apolitical and ostensibly neutral scientific knowledge is actually deeply intertwined with the re-production of material power (Ferguson, 1994; Leach &amp; Mearns, 1996; Mitchell, 2002; Robbins, 2012). For example, ‘‘scientific forestry” was used in India to advance timber extraction while significantly transforming livelihoods and disenfranchising local communities (Bryant, 1997; Guha, 2000). Goldman examined how the World Bank funds the production of expert knowledge, which it then uses to ‘‘underwrite a particular ideology of development” (2005, p. 174). Forsyth and Walker (2008) have argued that environmental discourses about forest loss in Thailand rely on selective forms of knowledge that reinforce social structures, particularly ethnic divisions.
Sociologists and historians of science have also examined the growing links between industry and scientific research, asking crit- ical questions about how the scientific knowledge produced through such partnerships – and what the public hears about this science – gets shaped by commercial interests (Frickel &amp; Hess, 2014; Mirowski, 2011; Moore et al., 2011; Oreskes &amp; Conway, 2011). In the case of biotechnology, research by Glenna et al. (2015) shows how ‘‘the intellectual property protections in GE (ge- netically engineered) crops are hindering some types of agricul- tural and environmental research,” (p. 166) despite concerted efforts to allow for such public research to occur (also see Kloppenburg, 2004; Tansey &amp; Rajotte, 2008). Of particular interest is the question of silences, including how Material Transfer Agree- ments and confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements shape sci- entific research, and the question of ‘‘undone science” – the fact that many important questions are simply not researched (Frickel et al., 2010).
Critical social scientists examining GM crops in the Global South have focused on power and knowledge production but have seldom examined both in tandem. One strand of research exami- nes the networks and actors promoting GM crops globally, and in Africa in particular. Recent scholarship examines the broader political-economic landscape in which coalitions of actors have sought to promote and build consensus around GM crops (Harsh, 2014; Ignatova, 2017; Schurman, 2017). Donor dependence (in- cluding the funding and training of African scientists) and the eco- nomic interests of corporations strongly shape these coalitions (Rock, 2019; Rock &amp; Schurman, 2020; Schnurr, 2013; Schurman,

2017). Several scholars have built on Gramsci’s notion of hege- mony (Andrée, 2007; Newell, 2009; Schnurr, 2013). Newell (2009) introduced the term ‘‘biohegemony” to examine how pow- erful groups produce consent to GM crops through the use of mate- rial, institutional, and discursive power. Discursive power, he argues, ‘‘derives from and expresses itself in the ability to construct and reinforce dominant framings of issues” (p. 52). Drawing on Newell, Schnurr (2013) examines the ‘‘constellations of power” – networks of organizations, corporations, and institutions – that create consent for the narrative that GM crops are the only solution to African agriculture. Other parallel scholarship has emphasized how these powerful dominant (productivist and techno-centric) perspectives emphasize particular expectations and narrowly frame debates around GM crops (Dowd-Uribe, 2017; Glover, 2010b; Jansen &amp; Gupta, 2009; Moseley et al., 2015; Scoones &amp; Thompson, 2011).
A second strand of research analyzes shortcomings in the eval- uation literature undergirding GM crop success narratives in the Global South. Scholars have found persistent methodological prob- lems in the GM crop evaluation literature in India and South Africa: narrow evaluation criteria, selective interpretation of evidence and data (Glover, 2010a), methodological problems in comparison known as selection and cultivation bias (Stone, 2011, 2012), and a downplaying of significant variability by reporting findings in averages (Glover, 2010a; Stone, 2011; Thompson &amp; Scoones, 2009). These concerns about problematic evaluation methodolo- gies contribute to a broader literature critical of how pro-GM suc- cess narratives rely on epistemologically narrow economic analyses that are disembedded from broader social, institutional, and historical contexts (Dowd-Uribe, 2014a, 2017; Flachs, 2019; Glover, 2010a; Jansen &amp; Gupta, 2009; Schnurr, 2012, 2019; Smale et al., 2006; Stone, 2011, 2012; Thompson &amp; Scoones, 2009).
We draw from both strands of research to examine the power dimensions of GM crop knowledge production in Burkina Faso. Our analysis employs a broad political ecology approach to power, paying attention to who has the ability to exercise influence, shape discourses, gain access to resources, and who (or what knowledge) is marginalized in relation to these abilities (Robbins, 2012). We thus examine how dominant epistemologies of agronomy and eco- nomics are intertwined with the economic interests of agri- businesses that often fund those research programs. In a classic political ecology vein, we are interested in how ‘‘apolitical narra- tives” that appear neutral, in fact, work to render invisible the material interests at stake (Ferguson, 1994), particularly relations of inequality and marginalization. Finally, we pay attention to how this process of knowledge production served to reproduce material benefits and the favorable position of the biotech industry in Africa.
2. Data and methods
This paper draws on multiple datasets, including an extensive review and content analysis of existing literature on Bt cotton in Burkina Faso. We also draw on two sets of long-term, qualitative data collected by the authors in Burkina Faso, indicating, where appropriate, upon which data we are drawing.1
The first author conducted eight months of ethnographic field- work in 2016, during Bt cotton phase-out negotiations and the return to conventional cotton. This author conducted 125 inter- views with cotton sector actors, including employees of the state-owned cotton company Société Burkinabè des Fibres Textiles (SOFITEX), government employees and research scientists, Mon-

santo employees, non-governmental actors, and 80 interviews with male and female cotton farmers. Fieldwork also included one month of participant observation with SOFITEX, attendance at a regional cotton conference and anti-GMO activist events, and five months of participant observation in a farming community in the Houndé region near Koumbia. The author conducted research in French and Dioula, languages the author speaks flu- ently. This enabled data collection not just from interviews but from the conversations and interactions of daily life, including extended farm visits, observations of conflicts and disputes, and long evenings of conversation with diverse groups of people.
The second author conducted eleven months of ethnographic field work between 2007 and 2009, during the final farmer field tri- als and first commercial growing season of Bt cotton. The author conducted over 100 interviews of actors implicated in the intro- duction of Bt cotton, including cotton sector officials in all three Burkinabè cotton companies, the Burkinabè Ministry of Agricul- ture, Burkina Faso’s Agricultural Research Institute – the Institut de l’Environnement et des Recherches Agricoles (INERA) (where he held a research affiliation), Monsanto, Syngenta, the World Bank, the French Development Agency, anti-GM groups and activists, and implicated local NGOs. This author also attended farmer field trials, two regional conferences on GM crops held in September 2007 and October 2008, and a November 2008 training on refugia sponsored by Monsanto. Additionally, this author conducted a sur- vey of 70 heads of household in one of the most productive cotton growing areas in Burkina Faso (Tuy Province) in February of 2009. This paper also draws from further trips to cotton growing commu- nities and interviews with cotton sector officials and cotton grow- ers in Burkina Faso totaling ten weeks in 2012, 2013, and 2018.
3. Portrait of a young success story
To briefly review, Burkina Faso conducted its first confined field trials of Bt cotton from 2003 to 2005. These trials were of two imported American Bt cotton cultivars (Coker 312 and DP50), which included the patented host material of their international partner, Monsanto. These original field trials reported an average yield increase of 14.7% (Vitale et al., 2008). Burkinabè cotton sector officials, however, wanted to use a Bt cotton cultivar that retained the agro-climatic adaptation and quality characteristics resulting from decades of local breeding efforts. At their request, the Bt trait was backcrossed onto three local cultivars – FK 290, FK 37, and STAM 59A – and reproduced for three generations with the aim of retaining desired characteristics (Dowd-Uribe &amp; Schnurr, 2016). Two of these new cultivars (FK95 BG II and FK96 BG II) were tested in a small field trial in Boni in 2006, and then on 20 farmer- led field trial sites in 2007. The peer reviewed literature on these field trials reported an average yield gain of 34% (Vitale et al., 2011). These field trials were the subject of great attention, receiv- ing visits from an international delegation in October 2007 of mul- tiple African countries, sponsored by USAID. Subsequent Bt evaluation publications were based on field surveys conducted by INERA (Burkina Faso’s Agricultural Research Institute) in 2009 of 160 cotton producers (Vitale et al., 2010), and then similar sur- veys from 2009 to 2014 (Vitale et al., 2016).
Just as in other GM crop-adopting countries in the Global South, pro-GM organizations portrayed Bt cotton in Burkina Faso as an unmitigated success. There were also, as elsewhere, pockets of anti-GM resistance and counter-narratives coming from both within and outside Burkina Faso, but these voices were generally disregarded by Burkinabè cotton sector officials and partners (Luna, 2020a). The dominance of GM advocacy organizations in constructing a success narrative was clear. They published reports with celebratory titles such as ‘‘Six Years of Successful Bt Cotton

Cultivation in Burkina Faso” (Karembu et al., 2014) or, ‘‘The success story of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso” (Pertry et al., 2016). Even after Burkina Faso’s phase out of Bt cotton, the narrative of success con- tinued. One organization in particular, Cornell’s Alliance for Science, published articles claiming that ‘‘GM cotton in Burkina Faso has in reality been a runaway success” (Conrow, 2016), and that the withdrawal of Bt cotton was ‘‘reversing the tide of pro- gress” (Gakpo, 2017). The post-withdrawal success narrative often framed Burkina Faso’s reversal as based on a simple ‘‘technical problem” (See Luna, 2020a). Importantly, Monsanto and other international organizations known for promoting biotechnology (e.g. the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications, or ISAAA, and Cornell’s Alliance for Science) played a disproportionate role in creating and propagating this success narrative.
What is striking about this success narrative is that nearly all of these articles and reports relied on and reproduced the same set of numbers and basic claims: that Bt cotton offered farmers 20% or even 30% yield improvements and increased ‘‘smallholder farmer profits by an average of 51 percent” (Gakpo, 2019). These and related numbers were consistently repeated and assumed to be proven. ISAAA used these numbers. Academic articles used these numbers, as in an article titled ‘‘Africa’s inevitable walk to geneti- cally modified (GM) crops” (Okeno et al., 2013). Monsanto’s inter- nal advice to employees regarding how to respond to questions about Bt cotton in Burkina Faso included the following line: ‘‘It has been proven that farmer income on average has increased up to 50%” (FleishmanHillard, 2015).
Significantly, these claims were drawn from a small number of studies from a narrow evaluation epistemology with significant methodological issues. We contend that these studies provided a thin and faulty basis on which to make grand claims about the suc- cess of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso. As Thompson and Scoones (2009, p. 391) remind us: ‘‘models are of course only as good as the assumptions and the data on which they are built.” In analyzing these studies, we find many of the same fundamental problems that have been found in the GM evaluation literature on Bt cotton in India and South Africa (Glover, 2010a; Schnurr, 2012; Stone, 2011, 2012). Here, we outline some of these central empirical con- cerns, before turning our analysis to how the production of this apolitical success narrative was itself a product of and productive of unequal power relations.
Finally, although we are critical of the unmitigated success nar- rative, we also want to be clear that we witnessed several brack- eted benefits from Bt cotton in Burkina Faso, most notably pesticide use reduction (a significant benefit for farm families exposed to toxic insecticides) and yield and labor productivity improvements for some farmers. These benefits were often ignored or denied by anti-GM activists. Our analysis seeks to carve out space for a more nuanced assessment.
3.1. Critical omissions and spurious claims
The critical literature on GM crops has well established that crop evaluation studies downplay or omit issues that operate at longer time scales,2 and obscure differential outcomes via a focus on average results (Glover, 2010a). These criticisms hold true for the Burkina Faso case as well. Curiously, the very same literature that establishes the ‘‘average” claims used to push a success narra- tive also documents significant differences in outcomes for farmers.
2 Concerns have been raised about the emergence of pest resistance and secondary pests in areas of intensive Bt cultivation. The dominant narrative in Burkina Faso either assumed refugia were planted or ignored the issue entirely. Yet our evidence indicates that refugia were rarely – if at all – planted (see below).
These findings are minimized, however, through linguistic framing and a general neglect of these findings.
Evaluation studies of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso regularly used ‘‘averages” in abstracts, introductions, and conclusions to assert the benefits of Bt cotton. These reported averages were widely cir- culated in news coverage and used to build the success narrative of Bt cotton. These averages, however, obscured substantial variabil- ity and differences in outcomes for farmers, which can be found buried in these same analyses. For example, one early paper claims that ‘‘the results found that across all years and both sites, that Bollgard II cotton provided a significant yield advantage of 14.7% over conventional cotton” (Vitale et al., 2008, p. 1964). Yet this claim obscures their own finding of a significant yield advantage in only two out of three years of research trials. Another paper claims that ‘‘Bt cotton producers earned a profit of $39.00 per ha, a $61.88 per ha increase in cotton income over conventional cot- ton, and also shifted producers’ bottom line from a negative posi- tion to a positive one” (Vitale et al., 2010, p. 320). This claim was based on a partial budget analysis, and the calculated profit gain was primarily a function of an estimated (average) 18.2% yield gain. However, the data in this paper (which suffer from major lim- itations which we discuss below) reveal significant variability. In one data table (p. 326), of 24 different combinations of farm size, region, and number of pesticide sprays, ten of these categories of farmers had negative revenue farming Bt cotton.3 Nonetheless, the paper glosses over this variability and instead gives the impres- sion of uniform or reliable gains via the reporting of averages, as in the quote above.
Beyond issues of selective reporting and placement of findings, at times the evaluation literature forwards assertions that lack evi- dence. One paper claimed that ‘‘Bt cotton increases land productiv- ity compared to conventional cotton, which (all else equal) provides a positive impact on the environment by reducing pres- sure on agricultural land” (Vitale et al., 2016, p. 128), which is a claim often made by GM crop advocates. However, our own field- work found that all else isn’t equal. Many larger-scale Bt cotton farmers reported increased acreage of cotton because of decreased labor requirements for insecticide spraying. A survey by Sanou et al. (2018) also substantiates this finding. Thus, this claim of reduced land pressure is unsubstantiated and likely to be false.
3.2. Methodological concerns regarding counterfactuals
In addition to issues regarding the reporting of findings and erroneous assertions, the evaluation literature also suffers from methodological issues with the ‘‘counterfactual,” or what Bt cotton was compared to. Counterfactual issues can be a significant (and often invisible) source of bias and can lead to over-estimates of GM crop yield differences (Stone, 2012). In brief, when Bt cotton yields are compared to conventional cotton yields, all other sources of yield variation need to be accounted for and controlled for. Two common counterfactual issues in the GM crop evaluation literature are ‘‘selection bias” and ‘‘cultivation bias.” Selection bias means that studies fail to control for underlying differences between farmers who ‘‘select” into growing Bt versus conventional. Com- parisons are then muddled because yield differences may be caused by different characteristics of farmers and not necessarily the GM trait. Cultivation bias means that the studies fail to control for differences in how farmers cultivate the two crops, such as treating Bt fields differently than conventional fields.
3 Negative revenue appears to have occurred for farmers in each region, at each level of pesticide spraying, and for each category of farm size. The paper gives no indication of how many farmers are in each category. This is just one example of contradictory data or confusing claims within these papers.
  
Here, we briefly discuss how these two sources of counterfactual error were likely present in much of Burkina Faso’s Bt yield evalua- tion literature, in particular 1) the on-farm field trials from 2006 and 2007 and, 2) the post-commercialization farmer surveys conducted by INERA between 2009 and 2014. A third – very different – source of yield data comes from aggregate cotton company statistics, which were used to establish cotton yield trends in a 2015 report (AICB, 2015). Cotton companies calculate yields by dividing the total weight of cotton received at the gin by the total production area. Total production area is derived from cotton cooperative data from individual villages and from data compiled by cotton company extension agents and coordinators. While these aggregate data have benefits (particularly in being a whole population data set, not a sample), they also do not control for selection or cultivation bias in comparing Bt and conventional yields.4 Here we focus principally on the issues with the evaluation literature, since this literature pro- duced the data upon which the success narrative was built.
Early on-farm field trials in 2006 and 2007 likely suffered from both selection and cultivation bias. The major article establishing the empirical results of these trials (Vitale et al., 2011) contains no statement about how yield gains were measured, nor any infor- mation on the counterfactual (that is, data on conventional cotton yields) used to establish claims of an average 34% yield gain. Yet these trials likely suffered from selection bias, based on our inter- views. Bt farmers were selected by the cotton companies and were generally ‘‘model” farmers who followed recommended practices. The trials also likely suffered from cultivation bias. Bt farmers were slated to receive an international delegation in their fields, a strong incentive to make sure that GM crops were well maintained. Sim- ilarly, the Burkinabè cotton sector officials guiding these field trials had an enormous incentive to make sure that the farmers were fol- lowing advised protocols – including but not limited to advised fer- tilizer application rates and pesticide spraying regimes. These incentives and differences in treatment likely exaggerated the dif- ference between Bt and conventional cotton yields.
Subsequent on-farm evaluation studies (Vitale et al., 2010, 2016) also likely suffered from selection and cultivation bias. The 2010 paper claims to compare yields and profits between Bt and conventional cotton, yet provides no explanation of how research- ers obtained data for conventional cotton yields. Stone (2012, p. 67) ascertained that the counterfactual likely came from refugia: areas of conventional cotton that are designated primarily to grow insects, not cotton, in order to forestall the emergence of pest resis- tance to the Bt toxin. Comparisons with conventional cotton grown in refugia would result in over-estimates of Bt cotton yield differ- ences since farmers would be unlikely to treat refugia with the same care. Additionally, our research spanning several years never came across a refugia, and numerous interviews with cotton sector actors indicated that refugia were unlikely to have been planted. A survey in 2015 (Sanou et al., 2018) found that 92% of farmers had never heard of them. Moreover, INERA was conducting research on whether non-cotton crops and natural plants could serve as refu- gia. These findings raise further questions about how conventional cotton yield data were obtained.
Other forms of selection and cultivation bias also likely skewed results. Comparing farmers growing Bt with those growing con- ventional can be problematic because of selection bias in the types of farmers who grow Bt versus conventional. A 2016 paper pro-
4 Further, as we discuss below, there are various reasons for farmers to mis-report their cotton production area, which consequently reduces yield estimate accuracy. We do not, however, know, nor have reason to believe, that production area reporting dynamics are significantly different (i.e. trending to over- or under-report acreage) between Bt and conventional farmers. In this sense, the aggregate data produced by SOFITEX may be the best available yield comparison estimates in the absence of the paired control experiments we suggest, and without more information regarding how evaluatory literature yield estimates were derived.
vides evidence for this, yet ignores and obfuscates its own evi- dence. The paper finds that ‘‘Bt cotton farms were 60% larger in field size than conventional farms and also had a larger household supply of agricultural labor and working animals than conven- tional farmers” (Vitale et al., 2016, p. 127). The paper also finds that larger farms have higher yields than smaller farms, for both con- ventional and Bt cotton farmers. Farm size and fertilizer use differ- ences between Bt and non-Bt growers were also found by Vognan and Fok (2019). These differences matter because the claim of Bt ‘‘yield advantages” appears to be based on non-controlled compar- isons. In other words, these are not paired studies with replicated field trials to account for soil variability, rainfall, pest pressures, and farming practices such as timing of planting, cultivation tech- niques, and the crucial factor of fertilizer application (which we examine below). Instead, yields from Bt cotton farms were simply compared with yields from conventional cotton farms, which is our best guess given the limited methodological descriptions in the lit- erature. An additional source of error in these comparisons may have resulted from cultivation bias, or differences in how farmers attended to Bt cotton fields. For example, farmers may have given more inputs and attention to Bt cotton than conventional cotton because of the higher seed cost of Bt cotton, more scrutiny from extension agents, or the higher potential for debt if the Bt crop failed (see below), as has been documented with Bt cotton adop- tions in other parts of the Global South (Stone, 2011, 2012).
Taking a step back, it is remarkable to consider that these few studies from a narrow evaluative epistemology, with significant methodological issues and biases in the reporting of findings, became the basis for a Bt cotton success narrative. Data that showed significant variation were glossed over with optimistic claims about average gains, and study designs failed to properly account for the effects of selection and cultivation bias in shaping yields. More critical studies (many of them independently con- ducted) have begun raising concerns about the dominant success narrative, with several studies finding that poorer/smaller-scale/l ess-equipped farmers were more likely to lose money by growing Bt cotton, and faced higher risks with Bt cotton (Dowd-Uribe, 2014a; Fok, 2016; Renaudin et al., 2012; Sanou et al., 2018; Vognan &amp; Fok, 2019). Furthermore, aggregate data from the Burk- inabè cotton sector showed that Bt cotton farms only had a 13% yield advantage over conventional cotton farms between 2009 and 2015 (AICB, 2015). Nonetheless, the success narrative and its inflated yield numbers remained the dominant story of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso. Why and how were these narrow and problematic knowledge claims produced and disseminated?
4. The political economy of knowledge production
We now turn to analyzing the political economy of the knowl- edge production process, highlighting the structures and incen- tives that shaped Bt cotton evaluation research in Burkina Faso. As Stone has argued, ‘‘we are naïve in swallowing empirical claims without a careful consideration of how vested interests affect the creation of facts” (2012, p. 64). We focus on the conflicts of interest inherent to the Bt cotton evaluation process, and in particular how Monsanto funding and control over the research process – princi- pally through a contract with INERA – significantly influenced the production and reporting of research findings. In this context, some Burkinabès expressed that their concerns challenging the success narrative were either silenced or left unexamined. These findings echo the broader literature on how industry influences science and biotechnology evaluation, and specifically how Mon- santo has regularly sought to shape and control scientific evalua- tions of its products in order to advance its economic interests (see McHenry, 2018).

4.1. Conflicts of interest
Bt cotton adoption in Burkina Faso provided an important financial boost for struggling public research institutions, and for Burkinabè researchers. Bt cotton was introduced through a part- nership between Monsanto, INERA, and the AICB. Of particular interest is the connection between Monsanto funding and Bt cot- ton evaluations. Data from our interviews indicates that Monsanto provided funding for multiple years of field trials, evaluation stud- ies, a lab to support breeding efforts, trainings for Burkinabè staff for breeding efforts, and for Burkinabè scientists and cotton sector officials to disseminate results in conferences and other venues.
This financial support came as public funding for agricultural research in Burkina Faso (and sub-Saharan African countries more broadly) had declined significantly since the mid 2000s, following the completion of two World Bank loans for agricultural research (Beitema &amp; Stads, 2014; Author interviews). In 2016, INERA’s direc- tor explained that the state ‘‘keeps the lights on,” but research funds generally come from outside donors. Several research directors explained that this dependence on external funding severely limits the kind of research they can do, because donors (and certainly cor- porations) have specific interests regarding what they will fund and short-term time horizons. While cotton sector research in Burkina Faso is better off than other sectors, it was nonetheless affected by these cuts. INERA was severely affected, relying on contributions from the cotton companies, and experiencing budget shortfalls that occasionally delayed salary payments for INERA employees (Dowd- Uribe, 2014a). This institutional situation meant that the opportu- nity to cooperate with Monsanto – and receive research funding from Monsanto – was an appealing opportunity for the Burkinabè cotton sector, research centers, and individual scientists.
The importance of Bt cotton funding for INERA highlights the power imbalances between African countries and the private and philanthropic organizations who fund biotechnology research (Ignatova, 2017; Rock &amp; Schurman, 2020; Schurman, 2017; C. B. Thompson, 2014). Funding from these entities is often portrayed as a much-needed lifeline for African research institutes. However, this funding also tends to come with explicit and implicit messages about the kind of research that will be done (Schnurr, 2013; Schurman, 2018), and often comes with Material Transfer Agree- ments, which may contain confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements regarding research processes (Mirowski, 2011; Tansey &amp; Rajotte, 2008).
It is in this political economic context that Monsanto-funded North American researchers and Burkinabè researchers from INERA collaborated to evaluate Bt cotton. Several academic papers and book chapters evaluating Bt cotton were even published with Monsanto co-authors, without accompanying ‘‘conflict of interest” statements (Vitale et al., 2008; Vitale &amp; Greenplate, 2014). Further complicating the institutional ties connecting researchers with Monsanto, INERA was also part of a contract with Monsanto. According to one scientist, ‘‘because INERA had signed a contract with Monsanto, Monsanto reviewed all our publications and pre- sentations.” This scientist explained that there were clear (if unstated) expectations for the kind of findings they should report, and felt that ongoing employment or promotion was implicitly dependent on meeting those expectations:
We saw photos of the Monsanto presidents with our president, and we knew they (Monsanto) had access to all of the ministers, but we do not. And so we self-censored. . . If you are in the good camp, you will be rewarded. If you are not, you will be set aside or marginalized.
Researchers in Burkina Faso – like other researchers worldwide – may also fear retribution or slander campaigns (Waltz, 2009). It
should be noted that there is a small community of research scien- tists in Burkina Faso, with revolving doors between INERA, SOFITEX, Monsanto (during its time in Burkina Faso), and related organiza- tions. Working for Monsanto was highly sought after since these positions had higher and secured pay, and international travel opportunities. These jobs are extraordinarily valuable in a country with few employment opportunities for specialized researchers.
Our point here is that there were significant conflicts of interest shaping the research context that produced the Bt evaluation liter- ature. Those charged with gathering and publishing data were not ‘‘independent” evaluators, which is ostensibly the role of state agencies and scientific researchers. Instead, they were dependent upon funding from a corporation that sought to sell the product they were evaluating, and bound by a contract that gave Monsanto oversight of their research. In addition to being constrained by this contract, many may have felt that their careers depended on facil- itating this partnership.
4.2. Silences
Building from this, we can also examine how this situation of institutional dependence shaped relationships between Burkinabè scientists and non-Burkinabè Monsanto employees. Several scien- tists and senior employees at various institutions in Burkina Faso said their knowledge and concerns had been sidelined by Mon- santo. In particular, Burkinabè scientists said they were aware early on of problems with Bt cotton’s ginning ratio and fiber length. Monsanto was also aware of these concerns, as revealed in inter- views with a Monsanto employee in 2008, and later by the fact that Monsanto paid financial compensation for the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 cotton seasons for these issues (AICB, 2015). These issues were thus known (on all sides), yet completely silenced in the success narrative of Bt. None of the Monsanto or INERA co- authored papers mentioned these issues, even in papers published as late as 2016.5
Some Burkinabè scientists felt that part of this silencing was due to a systematic – and potentially racialized – disrespect for Burkinabè scientists and their knowledge (also see Eddens, 2019; Luna, 2018; Rock, 2019; and see Ezezika et al., 2012 for similar comments from Burkinabè scientists). One senior scientist explained that he felt that non-Burkinabè Monsanto employees viewed African scientists as less qualified, and that because of this, Burkinabè scientists’ concerns were dismissed. In an interview, fol- lowing a discussion of the fiber-length issues, he explained:
Respondent: What happened, I don’t think it would have hap- pened if they had taken us seriously. Because we had the impres- sion that they underestimated the local (Burkinabè) researchers.
Interviewer: Who did?
Respondent: Monsanto. We had the impression that. . . so a PhD is a PhD. When we began to talk about problems (such as the short fiber length issue), they didn’t believe us. Otherwise, we could have found a solution much earlier.
Interviewer: So the Monsanto people weren’t believing local Burkinabè researchers.
Respondent: Exactly. . . I remember one time, I had to say to their director, I said, ma’m, you are a lawyer, when you speak, we lis- ten to you when you are talking about the law, correct? So why, when I talk about agronomy, why do you tell me that what I’m saying is false? Ma’m, you must respect me. Diploma for diploma.
5 More recent papers with INERA authors have been more critical of Bt cotton (Sanou et al., 2018; Vognan &amp; Fok, 2019). Interestingly, these were published after the end of Monsanto’s contract.
 
Another senior researcher recounted that many Burkinabè sci- entists were aware of fiber length issues early on, and also had con- cerns about high seed costs for farmers, but that their concerns and input were pushed aside. This researcher explained that:
In 2006, they backcrossed into Burkinabè varieties. In 2008, Monsanto said, ‘It’s ready.’ We (Burkinabè) scientists, we said no, we need to do more backcrossing. But Monsanto said there’s no problem...But in 2006, already, they knew that the fiber length was shorter. The ginning ratio was also a problem. But Monsanto said, when we make a few changes, and do it at a broader scale, it won’t be a problem. And the deals were done (gesture to indicate behind closed doors), and it was introduced. And the researchers didn’t have a whole lot of say in it. And we thought, well maybe this will work out. Maybe Monsanto knows how to fix the issue.
As both of these scientists indicate, there was a significantly unequal power dynamic between Monsanto and Burkinabè research institutions. Rather than this being a story of ‘‘knowledge sharing,” as is often promoted in discourses of bringing GM crops to Africa, many Burkinabè researchers felt that Monsanto side- stepped local actors, and in some cases, failed to heed their input. Of course, this wasn’t a simple power dynamic of Monsanto versus Burkina Faso. Local Monsanto employees were Burkinabè research- ers (most of whom previously worked for INERA or SOFITEX), and multiple actors and institutions were jockeying for influence (Compaoré Sawadogo, 2018). Nonetheless, our findings indicate that Monsanto’s substantial power in a country like Burkina Faso likely created a situation that silenced some voices and kept signif- icant issues with Bt cotton from coming to the public eye.
5. Apolitical knowledge production
In this section we examine how the knowledge produced to evaluate Bt cotton was partial and in some aspects even wrong, lar- gely because it was framed by an apolitical view that technology can – and should – be evaluated separately from the world in which it is embedded (Flachs, 2019; Glover, 2010; Luna, 2020a; Schnurr, 2019). This builds on our earlier analysis of the problem- atic methodologies and narrow epistemologies of the Bt evaluation literature. Here, we add an analysis of power, showing the addi- tional issues that resulted from a methodology that failed to acknowledge or examine the power dimensions affecting research processes as well as outcomes for farmers.
5.1. Power relations shape data collection
The social dimensions of the data collection process are almost entirely absent from the evaluatory literature. In fact, the pub- lished literature says very little about the data collection process in general. For the papers based on INERA surveys, authors simply note that data were gathered via household surveys and were col- lected by ‘‘local extension agents” (Vitale et al., 2010, p. 322, 2016; Vitale &amp; Greenplate, p. 256, 2014).
The lack of discussion around how data were collected is partic- ularly worrisome given the substantial literature documenting local-level power dynamics within the Burkinabè cotton sector. Power imbalances between cotton companies and cotton farmers have been at the center of cotton farmers’ mostly unsuccessful mobilizations to gain greater power (Dowd-Uribe, 2014b; Gray, 2008). A deep sense of mistrust and ‘‘demotivation” pervades the cotton sector and interactions between cotton farmers and cotton sector employees (Diallo, 2008), where many farmers feel marginalized, unheard, and exploited. Cotton extension agents reinforce a hierarchy that systematically marginalizes and dispar-
ages poorer and smaller-scale farmers (Luna, 2019). Other research points to how cotton sector re-organizations have favored wealth- ier producers to the detriment of small and poorer producers (Gray et al., 2018).
These power dynamics likely influenced the Bt cotton data col- lection process, particularly given that ‘‘local extension agents” were apparently the main data collectors. Many farmers have var- ious reasons to mis-report farm statistics to extension agents, and may have reported these same numbers when responding to these surveys. Our research identifies several circumstances in which farmers give false accounts of cotton acreage to extension agents. For example, if a farmer reports having a big enough field, they can get a truck to pick their cotton up directly from their field, rather than having to transport and weigh their own cotton. Sec- ond, farmers who report growing more than three hectares of cot- ton qualify for corn fertilizer and get additional inputs – and some farmers over-report acreage in order to obtain additional inputs for their corn. In the opposite direction, some farmers under-report cotton acreage because they want to purchase inputs on the mar- ket rather than receive SOFITEX insecticides (which they view as inferior quality), but which are mandatory and tied to acreage. Others simply want to limit debt, and spread inputs across a wider acreage and multiple crops. While these incentives to under- or over-report cotton acreage are not necessarily rooted in power dynamics, this information is channeled through extension agents, who hold substantial influence as the gatekeepers of resources. In other words, the hierarchical relationship between farmers and extension agents shapes the kind of knowledge farmers share with extension agents, complicating the ability of extension agents to conduct accurate surveys.
These critical dynamics are not acknowledged by the evaluatory literature despite their likely impacts on data validity. These arti- cles do not discuss how the social conditions of data collection may have influenced findings, or how such dynamics were (or were not) addressed in research protocols. We should be clear that these dynamics existed for both Bt and conventional farmers (though differences may exist that we are unaware of). We do not suggest that these dynamics necessarily produced exaggerated yield claims for Bt cotton. Rather, we argue that any data collected by extension agents in this setting should be treated with consid- erable skepticism, and in the least must be acknowledged, dis- cussed, and addressed in order to produce high quality data and comparisons. Our point here is that power-laden relationships between actors in the cotton sector may have shaped supposedly objective and neutral data, yet these very relationships were left invisible and unacknowledged.
5.2. Invisibilization of structural power: the case of fertilizer
The evaluation literature also overlooked how local-level power relations and structural inequalities shape farmer outcomes. We consider this in relation to fertilizer use and, in the following sec- tion, seed costs. Fertilizer rates influence Bt cotton profitability, and fertilizer application rates vary between wealthier and poorer farmers. However, none of the Bt cotton field trials or later studies assessed how fertilizer application rates would influence Bt out- comes. By assiduously ignoring the structural differences in farm practices for wealthy and poor farmers – differences which have been established in the social scientific literature in Burkina Faso (Gray, 2005; Gray &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2013) – apolitical evaluation studies produced knowledge that likely overestimated the benefits of Bt cotton, particularly for the poorest farmers.
Cotton production is linked to fertilizer use in several key ways. First, the cotton sector is the principal form of credit for Burkinabè farmers, and the main vehicle to receive fertilizers on credit. These fertilizers are then used not only on cotton but also other crops.

They are also sold, particularly by poorer farmers, as a way to gain access to money in times of need. The uneven access to and use of manures and fertilizers have been shown to be a primary mecha- nism by which social differentiation occurs at the village-level in rural Burkina Faso (Gray &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2013), particularly when wealthier farmers are able to purchase fertilizer at discounted rates from their poorer neighbors, who fall further into debt.
Differences in synthetic fertilizer (NPK and urea) application rates likely disproportionately benefited larger and more capital- ized Bt cotton farmers. A recent study by Vognan and Fok (2019) of the differentiated impacts of Bt cotton found that less- equipped farms (those with one pair of oxen or no oxen) used less fertilizer than better-equipped farms, and that conventional cotton fields received less fertilizer than Bt cotton fields. This study also found that well-equipped Bt farms (those applying higher rates of fertilizer) had the highest yields. Previous research by Gray and Dowd-Uribe (2013) also found that wealthier/larger farms had higher yields and applied more fertilizer. Additionally, numer- ous scientists at SOFITEX, INERA, and Monsanto indicated (in 2016) that lower rates of fertilizer use had produced differentially bad out- comes for poor farmers growing Bt cotton. One senior scientist at Monsanto explained it this way:
Respondent: Following the technical itinerary (official recom- mendations for input use) is even more important with Bollgar- d2 (Bt). Given that there is less insect damage, the cotton plant produces more capsules that need to be nourished with fertil- izer, at the very minimum the amount recommended . . ... . . With conventional, the insects will pierce some of the capsules so it will take less than Bollgard.
Interviewer: Less fertilizer?
Respondent: Yes, less fertilizer than Bollgard. . ... So if the farmer doesn’t apply much fertilizer (to Bollgard), it’s true that there will be a lot of capsules, but they will be tiny.
Interviewer: And thus the yield will be low.
Respondent: Yes, exactly.
This senior scientist (along with many others) thus explained that Bt cotton was more dependent on fertilizer than conventional cotton. This respondent also explained that farmers apply one third or two thirds of recommended inputs, and that the ‘‘smallest farm- ers have the lowest yields, because they use less fertilizer.” These observations also raise the important question of whether fertilizer use, not Bt seed, was driving observed yield differences between Bt and conventional, as Kranthi and Stone (2020) argue is the case in India. According to the AICB (2015), aggregate cotton sector data recorded an average conventional cotton yield pre-2008 (pre-Bt) of 1025 kg/ha, scarcely distinguishable from their data on Bt cotton yields (1034 kg/ha) from 2009 to 2015.
Given widespread awareness among Burkinabè cotton sector employees about differences between farmers in terms of fertilizer application rates, the question emerges: why were these differ- ences never incorporated into studies carried out in conjunction with INERA and Monsanto agronomists? Why were studies not done where fertilizer application rates were varied to account for farmer practices? Again, the problem is not that cotton sector employees were unaware of these inequalities between farmers. It is more likely that these issues were not considered to be within the purview of a ‘‘scientific,” meaning strictly apolitical, assessment of the technology (Kinchy, 2012), as the dominant epistemologies of agronomy and agricultural economics (and used in corporate- funded evaluation studies) tend to overlook social and power dynamics (Sumberg, 2017). Furthermore, despite the ‘‘pro-poor” discourses attached to crops like Bt cotton, cotton sector employ- ees are rarely interested in helping the poorest farmers, and tend to focus their efforts on ‘‘professionalizing” the larger-scale farmers
who are already well-off (Dowd-Uribe, 2011; Luna, 2019). Addi- tionally, recognizing and studying inequalities between farmers may have raised potential red flags and concerns about whether Bt cotton was as beneficial as claimed, or whether the seed price was too high. While some Burkinabè scientists were concerned about these issues, these questions were not in Monsanto’s interests.
5.3. Power relations shape outcomes: the case of seed cost
Our second case of how the evaluation studies overlooked local- level power dynamics examines the standard estimates of farmers’ seed costs. Many critics of GM crops have argued that high seed costs would disproportionately hurt small farmers. Part of this argument is that in rainfed agriculture, farmers risk losing a planted field due to gaps in rainfall and may have to replant – and thus repurchase – expensive GM seeds. However, proponents of Burkina Faso’s Bt cotton adoption noted its unique ‘‘per- hectare” pricing for seeds – which, in theory, meant that if seeds did not germinate uniformly, farmers could receive additional seed free of charge to complete the seeding process. This was viewed as a significant advancement, since farmers would not have to incur additional seed costs should their seeds not germinate uniformly.
The evaluation literature used the per-hectare price in calculat- ing Bt cotton’s profitability. Most cotton sector employees inter- viewed in 2016 also stated that farmers had access to free seeds for replanting should they need them. However, here, we show how power imbalances between farmers and cotton sector employees meant that in many cases farmers in fact had to pay to get additional seed. The omission of these ‘‘hidden” but alto- gether expected additional costs resulted in overestimates of farmer gains, while obscuring the power dimensions mediating farmer outcomes. Not surprisingly, given the overall slim margins of cotton production (Gray, 2008; Gray, Dowd-Uribe, &amp; Kaminski, 2018; Luna, 2020b), farmers explained that this extra cost had dra- matic effects on the profitability and risks of Bt cotton production.
To understand why farmers ended up paying more despite a ‘‘per-hectare” policy, we need to understand the context of cotton planting and the power relations shaping the process by which farmers obtain additional seeds. There are two categories for farm- ers to order additional seeds: re-semi (replanting, in the case of seed loss) and demande complementaire (additional order, in the case of wanting more seeds to expand acreage). Both orders are made through local extension agents (ATCs). These catch-up orders are placed in a context of utmost urgency: farmers are anxious to get cotton planted early, particularly given what farmers (and Burkinabè scientists) describe as increasingly variable rainfall and pest outbreaks in the late-season. Planting time is also a criti- cal labor bottleneck for families, as children are still in school, and families are rushing to get all their fields planted (Luna, 2020b). Germination problems are thus extraordinarily stressful and time sensitive.
According to many farmers, ‘‘early on” (2009, 2010), Bt seeds for re-planting were free, and the amount of original seed provided was more generous. However, farmers said that over time the orig- inal amount of seed was reduced. SOFITEX also got stricter regard- ing re-semi orders, telling farmers that they needed to take responsibility for their actions and that oftentimes poor germina- tion was the farmers’ fault or that farmers were lying. This is where power relations became a critical mediator shaping farmers’ seed costs, with SOFITEX employees shifting responsibility for germina- tion problems onto farmers. In order for a farmer to qualify for re- semi, the farmer needed to prove a legitimate loss of seeds, with the ATC inspecting the farmer’s field to verify. However, a single ATC is responsible for hundreds if not over a thousand farmers (the farmer to ATC ratio in SOFITEX is roughly 170,000: 200, or

850:1, according to 2016 SOFITEX data). Many smaller-scale farm- ers reported that ATCs would not verify their fields in the case of seed loss. Even if the ATC came, he might say the farmer had planted at the wrong time, or the density was wrong, and it was the farmer’s fault. Rather than go through this lengthy and poten- tially humiliating process, many farmers explained that – given the urgency of planting –they either purchased more seed from another farmer or ordered seed as a demande complementaire (ex- tra seed), which was more quickly and easily available, but was added – at full price, 27,000CFA per hectare – to their debts. In other words, these farmers’ lack of power meant that they paid more. Other actors in the cotton sector suggest that re-semi requests were written down by ATCs as demande complementaire, perhaps under orders from managers to reduce the quantity of re-semi. Other actors suggest explicit corruption.
These findings indicate that Bt seeds may have significantly increased some farmers’ risk of falling into debt – above and beyond recent studies finding that farmers viewed the basic seed cost as ‘‘barely acceptable” (Fok, 2016; also see Sanou et al., 2018) and that poorer farmers faced higher risks and negative outcomes with Bt (Vognan &amp; Fok, 2019). Additional per-hectare costs would only hap- pen when a farmer lost seed and purchased additional seed, but based on 2016 interviews, this was relatively common and a wide- spread concern for farmers. When repurchasing seed, a farmer could repeatedly lose 27,000CFA per hectare in one go, which was a poten- tially greater economic risk than the risks associated with conven- tional cotton (e.g. insecticide sprays can be washed off by rain, but this does not happen to all six sprays at once).6
These findings demonstrate the critical importance of paying attention to how power relationships between actors – in this case between farmers and cotton sector employees – shape both the research process, as well as how a technology plays out for differ- ently situated actors. Evaluation studies that assume a world with- out power overlook these critical dimensions. The lack of awareness of these power relations and their effects on both the data collected, and the profitability of the technology for farmers, likely produced skewed and overly optimistic estimations of the accumulation and distribution of benefits from Bt cotton.
6. Apolitical knowledge exacerbated power imbalances
In this last section, we explore the material consequences of the evaluation literature, which bolstered a broader success narrative that reproduced and exacerbated power imbalances. In other words, the success narrative not only relied upon and invisibilized relations of power, it also served to produce material outcomes that benefited those with vested interests. Optimistic yield claims produced by early studies were used to calculate royalty prices for Monsanto, and to promote the expansion of GM crops across Africa (Schnurr, 2012, 2013).
6.1. Skewed royalty distributions
The original 2008 agreement that brought Bt cotton to Burkina Faso stipulated a distribution of benefits whereby Monsanto would gain 28% of the value added, and its Burkinabè partners (cotton companies, cotton farmers, and INERA) would receive the remain- ing 72%. This agreement relied on a number of assumptions in order to calculate the added value of Bt cotton. It assumed yield increases of 30% and a reduction of four pesticide sprays, meaning lower pesticide costs and higher yields for farmers, and more cot-

ton to commercialize for cotton companies. The agreement used these estimated value additions to set the Bt cotton seed price paid by farmers, and to set the royalty payments for Monsanto. Royalty payments were first based on bags of seed, and in 2011 were fixed at 26 euros per hectare of planted Bt cotton. This unusual system was designed because individual royalty contracts were deemed unfeasible.
As we have shown in this paper, this use of the 30% yield esti- mate overestimates the actual yield increase, and thus overesti- mates the value being received by Burkinabè farmers and cotton companies from Bt cotton. Thirty percent yield gains are the high- est number that emerged from pre-commercialization studies, and yet this was the number that Monsanto mobilized in calculating its own monetary benefits. Later, aggregate data from the Burkinabè cotton sector found only a 13% yield advantage of Bt over conven- tional cotton between 2009 and 2015. The Burkinabè cotton body AICB thus argued in 2015 that the 30% yield advantage number was problematic and should be revised in any future calculations of seed price or Monsanto’s royalty payments (AICB, 2015). The fact that the 30% number was used provides a clear example of how Monsanto leveraged certain types of knowledge (knowledge which was produced through a particular set of power relationships) to further their own material interests. Here cotton seed prices (as an input cost), and the politicized assumptions that go into their creation, became a site for extracting more value from farmers than stipulated in the royalty agreement. This mirrors decades of scrutiny of seed cotton (farmgate) prices paid to West African cot- ton farmers, and how the lack of transparency surrounding price setting leads to farmers receiving a proportionally smaller percent- age of the total value of their labor (see Bassett, 2014).
It is also significant to point out that Monsanto was guaranteed payment, since their payment was based on the total area planted to Bt cotton. Yield increases could be lower than 30% – and indeed they were – but this did not affect the amount of money Monsanto received. The supposed ‘‘value-added” component for farmers and the cotton companies was dependent on what we have shown to be flawed assumptions about a fixed seed cost and consistently high yield gains (and ignored issues with fiber quality).7 This means that Burkinabè cotton companies and cotton farmers shoul- dered higher risk, needing to have optimal conditions to secure their negotiated percentage of benefits (also see Fok, 2016). In effect, although Monsanto only negotiated for 28% of the value, it received a much higher proportion of the total value generated by Bt cotton. Nonetheless, Monsanto and other pro-GM advocates claimed that farmers were capturing a majority of the benefits (James, 2010; Karembu et al., 2014).
6.2. Claims of success produce success
The success narrative – which relied upon the studies we have examined in this paper – helped pave the way for the expansion of GM crops in Africa, one of the central goals for agribusinesses in the African market (Schnurr, 2013; Schurman, 2017). This was achieved via the widespread promotion of the success narrative in news articles, briefings, press coverage, and by organizing tours and visits from other African countries. Yearly reports from the pro-GM crop group ISAAA put Burkina Faso front and center as an example of the rapid and successful expansion of GM crops in Africa. These reports drew on and reproduced the problematic claims that we have analyzed in this paper to promote GM crops more broadly to other African countries.
7 According to our fieldwork, the cotton companies also had unaccounted-for expenses in trying to manage two separate seed supply systems (Bt and conven- tional), keeping the Bt seed supply uncontaminated while processing both types of cotton through the same infrastructure of trucks and ginning facilities.

Burkina Faso’s success story rapidly replaced South Africa as the principal ‘‘showcase for how GM crops can perform in the hands of African smallholders” (Dowd-Uribe &amp; Schnurr, 2016, p. 165). The Burkinabè story was used to make a case for easing restrictions on GM crops across the continent, as when it was prominently fea- tured in debates over biosafety legislation in Nigeria. Additionally, Burkina Faso regularly hosted visiting delegations from other Afri- can nations. This included ‘‘Seeing is Believing” tours, organized by Monsanto and ISAAA, in which government and agriculture sector actors from more than 17 African countries were invited to Burkina Faso to ‘‘see for themselves” the successes of Bt cotton. These tours, also organized in South Africa, were used to promote and expand the success narrative throughout Africa (Schnurr, 2012). The expli- cit aim of these tours was ‘‘that the participants will use this expe- rience to expedite the commercialization process in their respective countries for the benefit of cotton farmers” (ISAAA, 2010).
However, the information, statistics, and narratives that tour par- ticipants received came from the problematic studies we examined in this paper. In other words, these studies were not only built upon (and disguised) relations of power, but they also served to reproduce power for the biotech industry by providing a model of success for the expansion of GM crops in Africa. We should also highlight the fact that many of the visiting delegations and field tours happened ‘‘well after Burkinabè cotton sector officials knew about cotton qual- ity issues with Bt cultivars” (Dowd-Uribe &amp; Schnurr, 2016, p. 165). This underscores the disjuncture between the prominent promotion of the success narrative and the other forms of knowledge that were known, but silenced or rendered less visible.
7. Conclusion
In the context of highly politicized GM crop introductions, many scientists and politicians assert that impartial scientific knowledge should drive decision-making (Gilbert, 2013; Herring &amp; Rao, 2012). This may explain why knowledge claims have been a cornerstone of GM crop advocacy. The ISAAA home page in 2020 features the heading, ‘‘We feed the world with knowledge.” Similarly, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Undersecretary of Agriculture rhetorically asked at a 2004 GM crop conference in Burkina Faso, ‘‘What is the best thing that this con- ference can bring to Africa? Knowledge” (Traoré et al., 2014). Per- haps the central form of knowledge regarding GM crops comes from pre- and post-adoption evaluation studies, which are ostensi- bly neutral and objective. In Burkina Faso, a small set of evaluation studies produced the knowledge used to create a broader success narrative, which claimed widespread and unequivocal gains from Bt cotton.
This paper untangles the puzzling disconnect between the visi- ble success narrative that surrounded the eight years of Bt cotton production in Burkina Faso, and the less visible (and invisibilized) knowledges of uncertainty, inequality, and problems that were present all along. Our close examination of the empirical basis for the success narrative reveals narrow evaluation epistemologies and methodological shortcomings similar to other GM crop evalu- ation studies in India and South Africa (Glover, 2010a; Schnurr, 2012; Stone, 2012), with major issues of farmer selection and cul- tivation bias that undermine the empirical validity of claims made about yield and profit increases. These shortcomings alone cast doubt on success narratives built upon narrow evaluation studies.
An analysis that ends at a methodological critique, however, would miss a more careful reading of the ways in which political-economic relationships shaped (while at the same time were rendered invisible in) Burkina Faso’s Bt cotton success narra- tive. We articulated three primary connections: how material rela- tionships such as funding structures and research contracts shaped
the context of knowledge production, how the resulting knowledge production process ignored local-level dynamics that shaped data collection and farmer outcomes, and finally, how the knowledge produced by this process served to reinforce the material benefits and favorable standing of the biotech industry. Each of these ways of thinking about the relationship between knowledge and power is distinct, but together help to explain why and how the success narrative was produced and why it endured.
First, the disproportionate power held by Monsanto produced a knowledge production context conducive to favorable findings. Monsanto funded the evaluatory research. The Burkinabè research organization (INERA) which executed these studies depended heavily on this funding and was confined by a contract with Mon- santo controlling their data and findings. The research scientists carrying out this work knew that favorable results (and certain kinds of methodological choices) were an expectation. This context helps to explain how the significant issues with Bt cotton – notably the inferior lint quality and corresponding significant economic losses, but also unequal outcomes between farmers and problems with seed cost – remained largely unknown to the public for nearly ten years, until Burkina Faso announced its phase-out of Bt cotton.
Second, evaluation studies invisibilized power at the local level, despite a significant literature demonstrating how local-level dynamics shape farmer outcomes. Studies did not acknowledge, nor apparently account for, how the hierarchical position of cotton extension agents could hinder their ability to generate valid data. Furthermore, in at least two cases – fertilizer application rates and seed costs – evaluatory studies overlooked how local inequal- ities between farmers and between farmers and extension agents could significantly affect the returns accrued by Bt cotton farmers. Importantly, the invisibilization of these dynamics likely caused the evaluation literature to over-estimate Bt cotton results in gen- eral, and in particular, overstate outcomes for marginalized farmers.
Third, the success narrative that emerged from these studies was then used to improve the material benefits Monsanto accrued and bolster the position of GM crops across the continent. The highest field trial yield numbers – over two times higher than later estimates – were used to calculate Monsanto’s royalties. Monsanto was guaranteed payment and received a higher percentage of the total value added than had been originally negotiated. Further- more, ‘‘Seeing is Believing” tours were organized to promote GM crops to other African decision-makers, all while knowledge of the problems with Bt was kept silent.
This analysis is important not just because it helps explain the puzzling persistence of the Bt cotton success narrative in Burkina Faso. It also reveals the implications of the careful construction of politics-free data – what we refer to as ‘‘apolitical knowledge.” Evaluation methodologies which invisibilize politics are an episte- mological choice, born from the asymmetric power held by Mon- santo. As we have shown here, the evaluatory studies conducted in Burkina Faso were funded by Monsanto, were shaped by a con- tract stipulating Monsanto’s control over the research, and findings were sometimes published with Monsanto co-authors. Monsanto has a real material interest in findings that benefit them yet appear neutral. Narrow, quantitative economic studies that focus solely on yields while ignoring the broader social and political landscape are best suited to do this, as these kinds of quantitative studies are broadly viewed as scientific, neutral, value-free, and objective, despite the studies themselves and the objects/processes they study being thoroughly shaped by power relations. Our point here is that broader power dynamics shape the very terrain on which evaluation methodologies are chosen. In theoretical terms, power- ful actors invisibilize power in order to reproduce their power.
As numerous African countries consider GM crop approvals and new biotechnologies such as CRISPR, the issues raised in this paper

will only become more pronounced and more important to address. Many of the dynamics reported here, from the conception of research protocols, industry control over research and findings, choice of evaluation approaches, collection of data, to representa- tion of findings to a broader public, are areas of concern and require critical attention. Our analysis offers several key consider- ations for these ongoing debates and, in particular, for efforts to evaluate these new technologies.
We recommend major revisions to the current paradigm of technology evaluation studies. This means greater transparency and accountability in the reporting of data and how data are col- lected, inclusion of critical qualitative literature which explores the social dimensions of production, and the integration of findings from this literature into research protocols to reduce forms of bias. We would also urge broader (open, transparent, reflexive) discus- sions of the knowledge production process itself (Stone, 2012). If indeed GM crop organizations and advocacy groups are committed to knowledge sharing and the scientific process, they should recog- nize that knowledge is partial and contains biases, and that such partiality and bias should be the subject of examination and critical scrutiny. Moreover, we argue for the need to critically examine how power dynamics shape knowledge production as well as agri- cultural outcomes. This would involve organizations – and scien- tific disciplines – scrutinizing epistemological choices made for evaluation studies, and could lead to multiple epistemological approaches being adopted and mutually considered. They must also address the clear conflict of interest inherent in industry con- tracts which limit the independence of scientific researchers. These suggestions do not undermine science. Instead, they would help produce a more self-reflexive and transparent science that takes into account how knowledge itself is produced (Neimark et al., 2019; Robbins, 2012), and would create a more nuanced space to debate and consider the relative merits of GM crops.

 ABSTRACT
This study assessed the farm-level economic and environmental impacts from the use of genetically modified (GM) corn in Vietnam (resistant to Lepidopteran pests of corn and tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate). It was largely based on a farmer survey conducted in 2018–19. The GM varieties out- performed conventional varieties in terms of yield by +30.4% (+15.2% if the yield comparison is with only the nearest performing equivalent conventional varieties) and reduced the cost of production by between US $26.47 per ha and US $31.30 per ha. For every extra US $1 spent on GM seed relative to conventional seed, farmers gained between an additional US $6.84 and US $12.55 in extra income. The GM maize technology also reduced insecticide and herbicide use. The average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to the GM crop area was 26% lower (1.66 kg per ha) than the average value for the conventional corn area (2.26 kg/ai per ha) and in terms of the associated environmental impact of the herbicide use, as measured by the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) indicator, it was lower by 36% than the average value applicable to the conventional corn area. Insecticides were used on a significantly lower GM crop area and, when used, in smaller amounts. The average amount of insecticide applied to the GM corn crop was significantly lower by 78% (0.08 kg/ai per ha) than the average value for the conventional corn area (0.36 kg/ai per ha) and in terms of the associated environmental impact of the insecticide use, as measured by the EIQ indicator, it was also lower by 77% than the average value for conventional corn (14.06 per ha).
Introduction
Corn/maize crops that have been genetically mod- ified (GM) to be tolerant to herbicides and resistant to some of the main corn pests became available to farmers in Vietnam in 2015, and in 2019, 92,000 ha (about 10.2% of the total crop) were planted to seed containing GM traits (statistical source: Crop Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development: CPD MARD).
This GM corn seed technology is tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate and offers resistance against the main (lepidopteran) corn pest; the Asian Corn Borer (ACB) – Ostrinia furnacalis but is also resistant to other lepidopteran pests such as corn earworms – Helicoverpa zea, common cutworms – Spodoptera litura and the Fall Armyworm (FAW) – Spodoptera frugiperda. The technology comprises two main trait alternatives. These are the combination of MON 89034 event, which contains two Bt proteins – Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 for the control of lepidop- teran pests coupled with the event NK603 (herbicide

tolerance trait). The other trait combination is the Bt11 event which contains one Bt protein – Cry1Ab for lepidopteran pest control coupled with the GA21 event (herbicide tolerance trait). Both of these com- binations of traits are referred to as “stacked” traits (herbicide tolerant (HT) and insect resistant (IR)). In relation to the IR events, MON 89034 is also some- times referred to as “pyramidal” because it contains two novel Bt proteins, while the Bt11 event, which contains only one Bt protein is not referred to as “pyramidal.”
The “stacked-traited” seed technology is avail- able to farmers in a limited number of yellow corn hybrid varieties that have been approved for use in Vietnam, notably NK66 BT/GT, NK 67 BT/ GT, NK4300 BT/GT, NK7328 BT/GT, DK9955S, DK6919S, DK8868S, DK6818S, and CP 501S. The technology is, however, not available in some of the latest developed hybrid varieties, is not available in specialty varieties (e.g., waxy corn used in the starch manufacturing sector), in sweetcorn or in open

pollinated varieties. In order to minimize the inci- dence of pests becoming resistance to the IR tech- nology, this is delivered by the use of “pyramidal” seed technology with two modes of control action against the lepidopteran pests of corn and by pro- viding “conventional seed refuge” provisions via “refuge in a bag” supplies of corn seed. These auto- matically include a 5% refuge of conventional corn seed in each bag of GM seed sold.
This paper presents the findings of an ex-post
analysis of the economic and environmental
impacts (related to changes in pesticide use) that
have arisen from the commercial adoption of this
GM yellow corn hybrid seed in Vietnam. It repre-
sents the first analysis of the farm impact of using
this corn seed technology relative to conventional
corn pest and weed control practices and therefore
provides a first opportunity to compare the impacts
in Vietnam with evidence from other GM corn user
countries. There is now a considerable body of
evidence, much of it in peer-reviewed literature
that quantifies broadly positive economic and
environmental impacts associated with the adop-
tion of GM crops, for example, as summarized in
Barfoot. Drawing for example on Brookes and Barfoot3 “GM insect resistant (IR) traits have mostly delivered higher farm incomes through improved yields and many farmers have also had lower costs of production (especially less expenditure on insecti- cides). The GM herbicide tolerant (HT) technology has mostly contributed to higher levels of farm income by reducing costs of production, notably on weed control. However, in relation to HT crops, over reliance on the use of glyphosate and the lack of crop and herbicide rotation by some farmers, in some regions (notably North and South America), has contributed to the development of weed resistance. To address this problem, farmers have increasingly adopted more integrated weed management strate- gies incorporating a mix of herbicides, other HT crops and cultural weed control measures (eg, using other herbicides with glyphosate rather than solely relying on glyphosate, using HT crops which are tolerant to other herbicides, such as glufosinate and using cultural practices such as mulching”). A brief comparison of the findings from this Vietnamese study with the findings of similar research is pre- sented in the latter discussion section.
Baseline: Nature of Production, Pests and Conventional Control
The total corn crop is grown over two or three seasons per calendar year. The winter-spring season involves sowing of crops in the period late December to mid- February and harvesting March–May. The summer season has sowing in May–June and harvesting late August to early October and the autumn/winter season has sowing in late August–October and harvesting November to January. Corn is grown in all of the main regions of Vietnam (Fig. 1). Three seasonal crops are grown by many farmers in the North Mid- lands/Mountain region, North Central, Highlands, and South-East regions, with two seasonal crops common- place in the Red River, Mekong Delta, and South- Central regions. In addition, in the main growing regions in the South (Central Highlands, South East, and Mekong Delta), some farmers also grow only one crop per year (planting in mid-May, harvesting in September). Overall, in the Red River, North Central and Central Coastal and North Midland/Mountain regions, approximately half of the crop is a spring crop, with about 30% autumn crop and 20% winter crop. The Autumn-Winter cropping season often fol- lows the harvesting of rice or beans.
Almost all seed (more than 99.5%) used by yel- low corn farmers is hybrid seed. Some open polli- nated varieties are also sold, mainly in the waxy corn and sweetcorn parts of the market (source; personal communications with corn seed company representatives)
The corn crop is a mix of dryland (rain-fed) and irrigated, with most regions relying on rain-fed produc- tion – the main users of irrigation are in the Red River and Mekong Delta regions. The most common form of production is continuous corn over the two-three sea- sons, although some farms may rotate/switch out of corn in favor of competitor crops like soybeans, sweet potatoes, and vegetables. If corn is not grown continu- ously, the main crop grown in rotation is rice.
In terms of the structure of production, the average size of farm-growing corn is about half to 1 ha. The average area planted to corn is also half to one ha, with farmers usually planting a large majority of their total farm area to one crop per season (statistical source: CPD MARD). Corn is an important cash and staple crop for many rural households who typically grow it in conjunction with rice (their main staple crop).

Figure 1. Map of main regions of Vietnam.
About two-thirds of the conventional crop use herbicides for weed control with hand weeding used on the remaining third of the crop (source; Brookes4). A mix of both forms of weed control occurs on many farms. Hand weeding is mostly found in the North-Central and South-Central regions (areas of relatively lower weed pressure).
The main pest of corn in Vietnam is the ACB, which regularly causes economic levels of yield loss in 60% to 70% of the crop (statistical source: CPD MARD). As a result, this proportion of the crop regularly uses insecticides to control this pest and despite the applica- tion of insecticides, average yield losses are estimated (source: CPD MARD) in the range of −5% to −7%. The highest yield losses are found in the North Midland and Mountain, South-Central Coastal, and Mekong Delta regions. The Corn Earworm pest also causes yield losses in 10% to 12% of the crop (which can be up to −10% yield loss and mainly affects farms in the Mekong Delta, Red River Delta, and North Mid-land and Mountain regions; source; personal communications from seed industry representatives). The FAW pest is a relatively new pest to Vietnam and, in 2019, was reported to be affecting between 35% and 75% of the corn area in most regions (source: personal communications from seed industry representatives), with the highest levels of
incidence in the regions of North Mid-lands /Mountainous, Red River, and North Central.
Materials and Methods
The primary source of information has come from
a survey of corn growers in Vietnam. Personal inter-
views with a sample of farmers in all corn-growing
regions of the country were conducted in 2018–2019
by staff from CPD MARD and technical staff in the
Provincial Departments of Crops and Plant Protection.
In addition, the baseline section following this section

corn production by region, with a focus on regions where varieties containing GM traits were widely grown (Table 1). As a result, there was a deliberate bias introduced into the survey to reflect the distribu- tion of plantings of GM corn and the sample. The target number of interviews for each region reflected the regional distribution of GM corn plantings in 2018 and as such resulted in a higher concentration of inter- views undertaken in the regions of the Mekong Delta, Red River Delta, and South East relative to their respec- tive regional importance to national corn production.

Results
Areas, Varieties, Cost of Seed and Yields
The 735 farms in the survey farmed 636 ha of land and planted a total of 463 ha of corn (average farm area of 0.865 ha and average corn area of 0.63 ha). In addition, 44% of the farms also grew rice (where grown, an average area of 0.31 ha), which was typically the second most important farming activity. In relation to the corn production, just under three-quarters of the farms sold all or some of their production, with 41% consuming some or all of their production.
Varieties with the stacked GM traits were planted by 395 farmers on 251.8 ha, with the main varieties planted (by area) being DK 6919S, NK 7328 BT/GT, NK 4300 BT/GT, and DK 9955S which together accounted for over 90% of the total GM crop planted area. Conventional varieties were planted by 396 farmers, inclusive of 56 farm- ers who planted both GM and conventional vari- eties. The total area planted to conventional varieties was 211.2 ha, with the main varieties planted being NK 7328, HN 88 (waxy variety), CP 511, and NK 4300. Within the category of conven- tional varieties, nearest performing (conventional) ones to the varieties containing the GM traits were planted by 152 farmers on 90 ha. The nearest per- forming conventional varieties were the same vari- eties as those containing the GM traits, except with no GM traits added (NK66, NK 67, NK4300, NK7328, DK9955, DK6919, DK8868, DK6818, and CP 501).

      Note: A total of 740 interviews were undertaken but five questionnaires were discarded due to inconsistent and/or incorrectly recorded data
Within each region, the aim was to divide the interviews equally between farmers growing GM corn and farmers planting conventional corn. The final outturn was a total of 395 farms using GM seed were interviewed, of which 56 of these farmers planted both GM and conventional corn seed vari- eties. The balance of 340 farmers interviewed planted only conventional corn.
The interviews were conducted mostly in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, with completion (of approximately 60 interviews in the North Mid-lands and Mountainous region) by the end of October 2019.
The methodology used for assessing the environ-
mental impact associated with pesticide use changes
with GM corn in Vietnam examines changes in the
volume (quantity) of pesticide applied and the use of
the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) indicator
(Kovach et al5 and annually updated). The EIQ indica-
tor provides an improved assessment of the impact of
GM crops on the environment when compared to only
examining changes in volume of active ingredient
applied, because it draws on some of the key toxicity
and environmental exposure data related to individual
products, as applicable to impacts on farm workers,
consumers and ecology. Drawing on Brookes and 3“
Barfoot The authors acknowledge that the EIQ is only
a hazard indicator and has important weaknesses (see
for example, Peterson and Schleier6 and Kniss and 7
 Coburn. ). Nevertheless, since assessing the full environ- mental impact of pesticide use changes with different production systems is complex and requires substantial collection of (site-specific) data (eg, on ground water levels, soil structure), it is not surprising that no such depth of data is available to provide a full impact assess- ment associated with pesticide use change with GM crops in any country. Therefore, despite the acknowledged weaknesses of the EIQ, it has been used in this paper

The GM varieties, with an average yield of 8.72 tonnes per ha (5.45 tonnes per ha de-husked and dried), out-performed the average of all of the conven- tional varieties grown by +30.4% (+2.03 tonnes per ha or about 1.27 tonnes per ha de-husked and dried). In terms of a yield comparison between the nearest per- forming equivalent conventional varieties to the GM- traited varieties, the GM varieties outperformed the conventional equivalents by +15.2% (+1.15 tonnes per ha or 0.72 tonnes per ha de-husked and dried).
The main reasons for choice of conventional varieties were ease of selling the variety, familiarity with the variety and satisfaction with the yield level achieved (Table 2). In relation to the GM varieties, the most important reason cited for choice was high yield, followed by pest resistance, the value of requiring minimal care (in terms of needing to monitor for pest attack) and ease of weed control.
For farmers using GM corn seed, the average cost paid for seed was US $130.8 per ha. For conventional “nearest equivalent corn varieties,” the average price paid for seed was US $97.38 per ha and the average price of seed for all conventional varieties was US $102.21 per ha. The (seed) premium paid by farmers for the GM traits was therefore equal to between US $28.59 per ha relative to nearest equivalent conven- tional varieties and US $33.42 per ha relative to the average of all conventional varieties planted.
Weed Control
Of the 395 farmers using GM corn seed, 82% used herbicides as the main form of weed control.
Eighteen percent stated that they did not use herbicides but (continued) to use hand weeding as their main form of weed control. A small proportion of farmers (who used herbicides as their main form of weed con- trol) also undertook some hand weeding (less than 20% of the total) or some mechanical weeding (less than 5% of the total). The main herbicides used were glyphosate, atrazine, and ametryn/atrazine, with glyphosate accounting for about half of the volume of herbicide active ingredient used, followed by atrazine and ame- tryn/atrazine which both accounted for about 15% each of the total amount of herbicide active ingredient used. The average cost of weed control when herbicides were used was US $45.72 per ha (comprising 48% for herbi- cides and 52% for application labor). Where supple- mented with other forms of weed control, these costs were an average of US $12.86 per ha for hand weeding (an average of 10 hours per ha when used) and an average of US $13.49 per ha for mechanical weeding (3 hrs). Based on the proportion of the GM corn crop using each form of weed control, the weighted average cost of weed control was US $40.73 per ha (Table 3).
Thirty-two percent of the farmers planting con- ventional varieties (127 farmers) indicated that they did not use herbicides for weed control on their conventional crops, relying on hand weeding only. Sixty-eight percent of the farms (269 farms) indi- cated that they made some use of herbicides. A small number (under 5% – less than 20 farms) supplemented their use of herbicides with some mechanical weeding. The main herbicides used on the conventional crop were atrazine, acetochlor, ametryn/atrazine, S metolachlor, and glufosinate, with atrazine accounting for about 55% of the volume of herbicide active ingredient used,

followed by acetochlor and ametryn/atrazine (15% and 7% respectively of the total amount of herbi- cide active ingredient used).
The average cost of conventional corn weed control, when herbicides were used was US $35.11 per ha (com- prising herbicides 46% and application labor 54%). Where supplemented with other forms of weed control, these costs were an average of US $117.6 per ha for hand weeding (an average of 126 hours per ha when used) and an average of US $33.62 per ha for mechan- ical weeding (17 hrs). Based on the proportion of the conventional corn crop using each form of weed con- trol, the weighted average cost of weed control was US $93.42 per ha (Table 3).
Pest Control
Nineteen percent of GM corn farmers used insecticides. These farms were located mostly in Thai Nguyen (Northern Mid-land and Mountain region) and Ha Noi (Red River region). Where applied, the main insec- ticides used were emamectin benzoate, diazinon, per- methrin, cypermethrin, and abamectin. The average expenditure on insecticide control, where used was US $55.65 per ha, of which 54% was for insecticide and 46% was for labor application.
Given that the GM seed technology provides control for the main corn pests, the circumstances relating to why these farmers were still making some use of insecticides were examined further. The main features were as follows:
● In 2019, FAW pest incidence was reported to be affecting between 35% and 75% of the corn area in most regions (source: personal communications from representatives of the seed industry), with the highest levels of incidence in the regions of North Mid-lands/Mountainous, Red River, and North Central. Experience of (controlling) this relatively new pest (in Vietnam) was limited and consequently, it is likely that some farmers did not realize that the GM corn seed provided control of this pest and therefore used insecticides for FAW control (notably the insecticide active ingredient emamectin benzoate). These farmers may also have made “insurance” applications of insecticide because they had no experience of how effective the seed was in controlling
the pest. It is interesting to note, for exam- ple, that in the Son La district of the Northern Mid-land and Mountainous region, where interviews did not take place until late 2019 (when farmers had experi- enced performance of the GM seed in con- trolling the FAW pest in early 2019 crops), there was no recorded use of insecticides by GM farmers at all. Also, it is likely that some farmers experienced different levels of FAW control according to the traits pre- sent in the seed varieties used – where the traits provided effective control, no addi- tional insecticide was used compared to using one additional insecticide application where the trait provided only partial suppression;
● Sixty percent of the GM farmers using insecticides were first time users of the seed. Therefore, it is possible that the lack of experience of using this technology and its efficacy levels in controlling pests may have contributed to some farmers mak- ing “insurance” applications of insecticide;
● Some of the insecticide use may have been used to control pests such as aphids, thrips, and the stored nut moth, which are not con- trolled by the GM traits
In addition, 60% of the GM corn farmers also said they devoted some time (an average 6 hours per ha) to scouting/crop walking for pest presence, at an average cost of US $13.58 per ha. Based on the proportion of the GM corn crop using insecticides and undertaking crop walking, the weighted aver- age cost of pest control was US $18.72 per ha (Table 4).

In contrast, 72% of conventional corn farmers used insecticides for pest control (of all corn pests including those controlled by GM traits as well as aphids, thrips, and the stored nut moth). The aver- age expenditure on insecticide control was US $35.15 per ha, of which 46% was for insecticide and 54% was for labor application. When applied, the main insecticides used were chlorfenapyr, chlorantraniliple, abamectin, emamectin benzoate, and spinetoram. Eighty percent of the conventional farmers also spent time (an average 17 hours per ha) scouting/crop walking for pest presence, at an average cost of US $38.84 per ha. Given the propor- tions of the conventional corn crop using insecti- cides and undertaking crop walking, the weighted average cost of pest control was US $56.38 per ha (Table 4).
Harvesting
The average amount of labor time spent on harvest- ing the GM crop was 92.5 hours per ha at a (weighted average) cost of US $124.90 per ha (Table 5). A large majority of the GM corn farms used adult family members (more than 80% of the total) to do harvesting, with just under 50% using some hired labor. The average amount of labor time spent on harvesting the conventional crop was 72 hours per ha at a (weighted average) cost of US $94.43 per ha. While a large majority of the conventional farms used adult family members (90% of the total) to do harvesting and 42% made some use of hired labor, the relative importance of
Table 5. Corn harvesting costs and labor use (per ha).
family labor was greater than among the farmers growing GM corn.
Farmers Views and Perceptions
The farmers who had grown GM corn were asked about any likes or benefits they perceived had occurred from using this type of corn. Improved pest and weed control were cited most frequently by 92% and 85% respectively of the farmers, with higher yields, cost saving, better grain quality, and higher income all registered as positive impacts by between 57% and 72% of the farmers. In addition, the 225 farmers (57% of the GM corn farmers) who actively stated that the use of GM corn had resulted in higher incomes also provided further information about the impact of having higher levels of income. The main impacts were having more money for on-farm invest- ment and/or to spend on their families plus less need for family members to work on the farm.
In relation to perceived negative aspects of using GM corn, 158 farmers (40% of users) provided responses to this question. The main complaint, registered by 134 farms (34% of all GM farmers or 85% of this sub-set of responding farmers) was about the (high) price of seed. There were very few other complaints; less than 4% of farmers (15 farmers) said they perceived there might be “nega- tive health” issues associated with use of the tech- nology (based on information they had read in the media) and 2% (8 farmers) said they were disap- pointed with the yield performance.
Lastly, the likelihood of farmers choosing to grow GM corn again in the next season, only two farms (0.5% of the total) said they would not plant GM corn next season.
Conventional corn growers were asked why they had not tried using GM corn. One hundred and sixteen conventional corn growers offered responses to this question with the main reason cited (by 57% of the respondents: 66 farmers) being the (high) price of the seed. In addition, 29% of these farmers (34 farmers) indicated that they perceived that the benefit would be less than the expected higher cost of the seed. Lastly, 10 farmers (9% of this group) were grow- ing specialty varieties of waxy corn and said if they switched to using GM seed (the GM traits are not available in any waxy corn varieties), they would expect to see income levels fall

because any agronomic gains would be offset by the higher cost of seed and lower value of the (non-waxy) corn.
Overall Yield, Cost of Production and Income Impacts
The main impacts of using GM corn have been (Table 6):
● The GM varieties out-performed conventional varieties in terms of yield by +30.4% (+2.03 tonnes per ha or about 1.27 tonnes per ha de- husked and dried). In relation to a yield com- parison between the nearest performing equivalent conventional varieties to the GM- traited varieties, the GM varieties outper- formed the conventional equivalents by +15.2% (+1.15 tonnes per ha or 0.72 tonnes per ha de-husked and dried). In revenue terms this amounted to an increase of between US $169.20 per ha and US $298.45 per ha;
● There have been changes in the type and nat- ure of herbicides applied (more use of the broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate and less use of pre-emergent herbicides like atrazine and acetochlor). There has also been a reduction in the use of hand weeding.
While average expenditure on herbicides and their application has increased, this has been more than offset by savings from less use of hand weeding. Overall, the average cost of weed control has fallen by US $52.69 per ha;
● There have been reductions in the use of insecti- cides for the control of pests, with the control of the main lepidopteran pests now provided via the seed, leaving residual use of insecticides for the control of pests not controlled by the GM traits. These savings amounted to US $14.75 per ha. In addition, farmers using GM varieties spent less time on crop walking/scouting checking pest levels. This resulted in an additional cost saving equal to US $22.93 per ha;
● The higher yields derived from GM corn have required additional use of labor for harvesting. This extra cost has been an average of nearly US $30.46 per ha;
● The cost of seed has increased, with the seed pre- mium for GM corn seed being an average of between US $28.60 per ha (average to all conven- tional varieties used) and US $33.43 per ha (aver- age to equivalent performing varieties to the GM varieties);
● Overall, the net impact on farm income asso- ciated with using GM corn has been an increase in the average level of farm income

of between US $196 per ha (relative to equiva- lent conventional varieties) and US $330 per ha (average of all conventional varieties);
● It is interesting to note that 18% of the farmers using GM corn did not use herbicides for weed control even though the seed contained toler- ance to the herbicide glyphosate. In effect, these farmers used the seed specifically for its pest control capability rather than its potential for improving weed control. While these farms will have foregone potential weed control cost savings (as derived by other users of the tech- nology), the savings associated with lower pest control costs and higher yields were still significant;
● An important production impact highlighted by 60% of the GM corn users was improvements in the quality of the grain. While the farmers who highlighted this impact did not provide additional information about the nature of these quality improvements, it is likely, based on the findings of analysis of the impact of using GM corn in other countries (e.g., Folcher et al8 Bakan et al9 Munkvold et al10 Wu11) that this relates to reduced levels of aflatoxins and fumonisins in the GM crop grain compared to conventional corn. This can result in reduced levels of wastage and/or rejection by purchasers (of the grain), notably in the food using sector.
Examining the cost farmers pay for accessing the GM seed technology, the average additional cost of seed (seed premium) relative to conventional seed, over the period of adoption was between US $28.60 per ha and US $33.43 per ha. These cost of technol- ogy values are equal to between 8% and 15% of the total (gross) technology gains (before deduction of the additional cost of the technology payable to the seed supply chain – the cost of the technology accrues to the seed supply chain including sellers of seed to farmers, seed multipliers, plant breeders, distributors, and the GM technology providers). In terms of investment, this means that for each extra dollar invested in GM corn seed (relative to the cost of conventional seed), farmers gained an average of between US $6.84 and US $12.55 in extra income.
The main changes in labor use associated with the adoption of GM corn were:
● A reduction in the total amount of labor used per ha of about 71 hours per ha (−8.9 days). This derives from less use of labor for weeding (largely hand weeding), application of insecti- cides and crop walking/scouting. Some of these labor reductions were offset by an increase in the labor requirement for harvesting;
● As the majority of the labor used on farms has been family labor, the labor requirement changes have mostly impacted on this category of labor. For hired labor, the adoption of GM corn has resulted in a small net increase in labor requirement because of the increased requirement for harvesting. While the require- ment for hired labor to undertake weed control (and to a lesser extent pest control) has decreased, this has been more than offset by an increase in hired labor use for harvesting. Overall, the hired labor requirement has increased by about 10 hours per ha (1.25 days per ha);
● The overall reduction in labor use on GM corn growing farms, which has mostly impacted on the use of family labor was acknowledged by many of these farmers as a positive aspect of change because it had freed up more time for farmers and their family to spend on other income-generating activities and leisure.
Environmental Impact Associated with Herbicide Use for Weed Control
GM farmers increased their use of herbicides as the primary form of weed control relative to the weed control practices of conventional corn producers. However, the profile and volume of the herbicides used have changed, with the average amount of herbi- cide active ingredient used and its associated environ- mental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator being lower for GM corn adopters than conventional corn growers. The average amount of herbicide active ingre- dient applied on the 82% of the GM crop area that used herbicides for weed control was 2.08 kg/ai per ha, compared to 2.88 kg/ai per ha on the 68% of the conventional corn crop area that used herbicides for weed control. When this herbicide usage is averaged across the respective total areas planted to GM and conventional corn, the average amount of herbicide applied to the GM corn crop was 26% lower (1.66 kg

per ha) than the average value for the conventional corn area (2.26 kg/ai per ha).
In terms of the associated environmental impact of the herbicide use, as measured by the EIQ indicator, the average EIQ value or load per ha of herbicide active ingredient applied on the 82% of the GM crop area that used herbicides, was 37.95 per ha, compared to 59.74 per ha on the 68% of the conventional corn crop area that used herbicides. When this herbicide usage is averaged across the respective total areas planted to GM and conventional corn, the average EIQ load per ha was also lower by 36% (30.26 per ha) than the average value applicable to the conventional corn area (46.95 per ha).
Environmental Impact Associated with Insecticide Use for Pest Control
The adoption of GM corn has led to changes in pest control practices, with GM farmers applying insec- ticide to a significantly lower crop area and, where used, in smaller amounts.
On the 19% of the GM crop area that used insecti- cides, the average amount of insecticide applied was 0.42 kg/ai per ha, compared to an average of 0.5 kg/ai per ha on the 72% of the conventional corn crop area that used insecticides. When this insecticide usage is averaged across the respective total areas planted to GM and conventional corn, the average amount of insecticide applied to the GM corn crop was signifi- cantly lower by 78% (0.08 kg/ai per ha) than the average value for the conventional corn area (0.36 kg/ai per ha).
In terms of the associated environmental impact of the insecticide use, as measured by the EIQ indicator, the average insecticide EIQ load per ha value on the 19% of the GM crop area that used insecticides was 17.26 per ha, compared to an aver- age of 19.65 per ha on the 72% of the conventional corn crop area that used insecticides. When this insecticide usage is averaged across the respective total areas planted to GM and conventional corn, the average EIQ per ha was significantly lower by 77% (3.23 per ha) than the average value for con- ventional corn (14.06 per ha).
Views, Experiences and Perceptions of GM Corn
The vast majority of farmers who had grown GM corn expressed high levels of satisfaction with the technology and no negative impacts were identified in the farm survey, other than a number of farmers (less than 10% of users) indicating that perceived that the additional cost of the seed was too high. Despite this, 99.5% of adopters stated that they would be using the technology in the 2020 crop year. The high levels of satisfaction were linked to the benefits associated with adoption, of improved levels of pest and weed control, higher yields, higher incomes, and better grain quality. In addition, the higher levels of income had resulted in farmers having more money for on-farm invest- ment and household expenditure. Also, there has been reduced need for family members to work on farms, allowing more time for leisure activities.
In relation to conventional corn growers the main reasons cited for not trying the new technology was the (perceived) high price of the seed relative to con- ventional seed and/or the view that the benefit (of adoption) would be less than the extra cost of the seed. In addition, growers of specialty varieties of waxy corn said if they switched to using GM seed (the GM traits are not available in any waxy corn varieties), they would expect to see income levels fall because any agronomic gains would be offset by the higher cost of seed and lower value of the non- specialty corn.
Aggregated Impacts
The aggregated farm-level income impact of using GM corn, based on the survey findings and applied to the national level of GM corn seed adoption in 2019 (92,000 ha or 10.2% of the national crop) was a net income gain of between US $17.95 million (based on the yield gain relative to the nearest equivalent vari- eties to the GM varieties) and US $30.38 million (based on the yield gain relative to all conventional varieties). The vast majority of the income gains (more than 90%) came from yield gains, with some small additional benefits associated with lower net costs of production.
If these farm income gains are applied to the cumulative GM crop area since the technology

was first used in 2015 (a total of 224,500 ha 2015–2019), the total farm income gain has been between US $43.8 million (based on the yield gains relative to the nearest equivalent conventional vari- eties) and US $74.1 million (based on yield gains relative to all conventional varieties).
Based on the yield gains referred earlier, the GM corn technology added between 66,000 tonnes and 117,000 tonnes of corn in 2019 and cumulatively since 2015 has added between 157,900 tonnes (based on the yield gains relative to the nearest equivalent conventional varieties) and 315,400 tonnes (based on yield gains relative all conventional varieties).
At the national level, the aggregate labor impact in 2019 is small and equal to a net reduction in labor use of about 6.52 million hours or 815,000 days (or 3,400 full-time equivalents – FTEs). Most of this reduction in labor use has affected family labor. In terms of hired farm labor, the impact has been a net increase of about 0.92 million hours (115,000 days), or 480 FTEs, pri- marily for additional crop harvesting work.
In relation to weed control changes, the use of GM corn (on the equivalent of 10.2% of the total corn crop) resulted in a reduction in the amount of herbicide active ingredient used on the whole crop of 2.7% (−55,220 kg) and a net reduction in the associated EIQ value of 3.6% (Table 7). Cumulatively, since 2015, there has been a net decrease in the amount of herbicide active ingredient used of 134,760 kg (−1.2% of total crop use over this period) and a net reduction in the environmental load associated with herbicide use, as measured by the EIQ indicator of 1.5%.
In terms of the pest control, the use of GM corn has led to a reduction in the amount of insecticide active ingredient used on the whole crop of 25,440 kg (−7.95% in terms of all insecticide used on the crop) and a net reduction in the associated EIQ value of 7.87%. Cumulatively, since 2015, there has been a net decrease in the amount of insecticide active ingredient used of 62,075 kg (−3.4% of total crop use over this period) and
a net reduction in the environmental load associated with insecticide use, as measured by the EIQ indicator of 3.3%.
Discussion and Conclusion
The evidence identified in the farm survey shows that GM corn adoption in Vietnam has delivered signifi- cant socio-economic benefits to the farms that have used the technology. There have also been wider (to society) environmental benefits associated with changes to weed and pest control practices that have reduced the environmental load associated with pes- ticide use on corn.
The yield gains, at more than +15% (and up to
+30%) are at the higher end of the range of perfor-

Evidence of possible negative impacts associated with adoption of this corn seed technology in other countries such as incidence of pests becoming resis- tant to the GM technology (e.g., Tabashnik and Carrière25) or to the development of weeds becoming resistant to glyphosate (as discussed in the introduc- tion) were not found in this study. While the authors acknowledge that incidence of pest and weed resis- tance issues could arise in the future, as indicated in the introduction, the scope for pest resistance devel- oping has been reduced through the use of GM seed technology with two modes of control action against the lepidopteran pests of corn and by providing “con- ventional seed refuge” provisions via “refuge in a bag” supplies of corn seed. These automatically include a 5% refuge of conventional corn seed in each bag of GM seed sold. In addition, the risk of weeds develop- ing resistance to glyphosate has been reduced through extension advice and training provided by the GM seed suppliers to farmers before they use the seed that, for example, that advises that if glyphosate is being used for “over the top of crop” weed control with GM corn, that farmers should ensure that different forms of weed control (including, e.g., mechanical or hand weeding) or other herbicides (with different modes of action) are also used, especially at the soil preparation and early, pre-emergence phase of crop growth (source: personal communication from representa- tives of the seed industry).

            <Title>Status of GM Crops in Europe</Title>
            <Text>Regulatory restrictions on GM crops in Europe is especially evident in the extent of authorization for cultivation of these crops, but not as severely in authorizations for their importation for food, feed and processing. Because of the regulatory system in Europe, authorization for growing GM crops is granted at the European Union level, but individual member states can make a decisions on whether those crops are allowed to be grown in their jurisdiction. Authorization to grow GM crops has been difficult to obtain in Europe, with only eleven products (“events”Approvals of GM products are issued for “events”, i.e. an initial molecular insertion into a plant and subsequent offspring derived from sexual reproduction or asexual propagation. ) having received such authorization: seven carnation, one cotton, two maize, and one potatohttp://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/advsearch/default.asp?CropID=Any&amp;TraitTypeID=Any&amp;DeveloperID=Any&amp;CountryID=EU&amp;ApprovalTypeID=3. However, only one event, an insect-resistant maize (event MON810), is currently being grown in two member states, Spain and Portugal, but prohibited by others. Spain has been cultivating this event since 1998, and Portugal since 2012 { | Brookes, 2019 | | |zu:5334702:8A9PIIHU}{ | Brookes &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}{ | Fernandes, et al., 2014 | | |zu:5334702:RDBEKX7J}. In the past, MON810 was grown in as many as four of the EU member states during 2015 and 2016 but by 2017 only in Spain and Portugal continued this cultivation { | Rostoks et al., 2019 | | |zu:5334702:8PMDG9RJ}. Some have argued that the restrictions on GM crops has had a negative impact on European agriculture { | Stanciu, &amp; Sarbu, 2019 | | |zu:5334702:VUZKPERP}. Although cultivation of GM crops is limited in the EU, there are over 50 GM plant events that are authorized in the EU for food and feed import and processing  https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/gmo/eu_register_en. Therefore, there are products in Europe that contain GM components, and it would be of interest to determine whether the European consumer deliberately avoids these products, or is in fact aware that foods might contain such products but might not be aware of their presence because they do not reach the threshold for labeling of 0.9%Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32003R1830.
For Spain and Portugal, the economic and environmental benefits have been documented. Brookes { | -Brookes, 2019 | | |zu:5334702:8A9PIIHU} reported that in the 21 years since maize was ﬁrst cultivated in on the Iberian peninsula in 1998, a total of 1.65 million hectares have been planted, with farmers beneﬁting from an increase in income of €285.4 million, primarily due to higher crop yields. Insecticide spraying has also decreased by 678,000 kg of active ingredient, with inferred decreased in environmental impact and health.</Text>

  Abstract Policy protection goals are set up in most countries to minimise harm to the environment, humans and animals caused by human activities. Decisions on whether to approve new agricultural products, like pesticides or genetically modified (GM) crops, take into account these policy protection goals. To support decision-making, applications for approval of commercial uses of GM crops usually comprise an environmental risk assessment (ERA). These risk assessments are analytical tools, based on science, that follow a conceptual model that includes a problem formulation step where policy protection goals are considered. However, in most countries, risk assessors face major problems in that policy protection goals set in the legislation are stated in very broad terms and are too ambiguous to be directly applicable in ERAs. This means that risk assessors often have to interpret policy protection goals without clear guidance on what effects would be considered harmful.

Introduction
Environmental risk assessments (ERAs) are an essen- tial part of regulatory decision-making for genetically modified (GM) crops in most countries. These risk assessments are analytical tools, based on science, which help decision making. To conduct useful ERAs, it is essential that environmental policy protection goals are considered. Ideally, the environmental resources to be protected, the degree of protection they deserve, or the maximum impacts that should be tolerated, will be set by policy before ERAs are conducted. However, in most countries, policy pro- tection goals set in the legislation are stated very broadly and are too ambiguous to be directly appli- cable in ERAs. In addition, in most countries, not only are clear definitions of what needs to be protected missing, but there are no definitions of what effects of a GM crop would be considered as harmful to the environment. This means that risk assessors have to interpret policy protection goals without clear

 guidance on what effects would be considered harm- ful. In some countries, this problem is proving difficult to solve: changes in environmental policy or specifi- cation of levels that would constitute environmental harm may not be a priority. Meanwhile ERAs to support regulatory applications for the approval of GM crops have to continue. In this paper we propose a practical approach that may help risk assessors to translate policy protection goals into unambiguous (i.e., operational) protection goals that can be used in ERAs. The formulation of operational protection goals in turn helps the identification of assessment and measurement endpoints.
Operational protection goals
In general, policy protection goals are designed to be broad so they can be easily agreed at political level (Evans et al. 2006). Another advantage of breadth is that protection goals do not have to be continually redrafted to cope with new situations and scientific developments. Hence legal definitions of protection goals use broad normative concepts such as ‘‘sustain- ability’’, ‘‘integrity’’ and ‘‘acceptability’’. These con- cepts, unless clearly defined, can be interpreted in many different ways and they become almost impos- sible to predict or to measure objectively. Different groups may have different interpretations of what is sustainable or what is acceptable. Ideally, therefore, these policy protection goals should be translated into operational protection goals in the regulatory frame- work so that ERAs can focus on the key concerns for decision-making. As discussed above, this is not often the case, so it falls to the risk assessors to interpret the policy objectives and turn them into operational protection goals.
In most countries, despite a clear will to protect the environment, environmental policy protection goals are not always clearly defined. Nevertheless, the protection of biodiversity and sustainable agricultural production are almost universal protection goals. ERAs for GM crops aim to support these policy protection goals. Several areas of assessment are usually considered, such as persistence and invasiveness of the GM crop, its effects on non-target organisms, its effects on soil, and so on. Protection of biodiversity and protection of agricultural production can sometimes appear to be in conflict. In the case of herbicide tolerant crops, which
have been introduced to improve management of weeds, there has been much discussion regarding the potential benefits to agriculture and the potential adverse effects on biodiversity from changes in the abundance or types of weed. These conflicts are often found during the ERA, and in the absence of clear policy guidance, all the risk assessor can do is to highlight the effects of using the product, and that the effects may be beneficial, adverse or neutral depending on which protection goal is considered. It is then the task of risk managers to make a decision by weighing the risk against the potential benefit.
One way to translate policy protection goals into operational protection goals for ERAs of GM crops is to use an ecosystem services approach. This approach has been proposed for adoption in other regulatory frameworks, such as the plant protection product registration in the EU (Nienstedt et al. 2012). Other conceptual frameworks are available for making policy objectives operational; for example, natural resource management (e.g., Keough and Blahna 2006). Like ecosystem services, these methods seek ways to balance economic, social and environmental objectives. We discuss the ecosystem services concept as a means of illustrating the process of making policy objectives operational. We do not necessarily advo- cate it as the only or best method in all circumstances.
The ecosystem services concept was first formally described in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) (MEA 2005). The ecosystem services approach takes into consideration the benefits that humans receive from particular ecosystems. They comprise provision- ing services (e.g. food production), regulating services (e.g. biological control or pollination), cultural services (e.g. recreation, cultural heritage) and supporting services (e.g. nutrient cycling) (Nienstedt et al. 2012). Different types of ecosystems will therefore offer different types of ecosystem services. Usually not all services can be protected at the same level and conflicts often arise requiring trade-offs to be made.
Using the ecosystem services approach, the most relevant services can be identified in order to establish the desired level of protection. In an agricultural context, the most relevant ecosystem services will vary depending on the spatial scale considered. In cropped areas, one of the most important services is the production of food. This provisioning service is supported by regulating services, such pollination and pest regulation, and supporting services, such as
123

Transgenic Res (2014) 23:945–956
947
 decomposition of organic matter, soil nutrient cycling and water regulation and purification (Sanvido et al. 2012; Moonen and Barberi 2008). Cultural services from cropped areas may also be considered. For example, in heavily urbanized countries, like the UK, crops are considered important habitats for valued farmland bird species, which, among other things, provide a recreational service to birdwatchers (Tscharntke et al. 2012). Using this approach, policy protection goals can be translated into operational protection goals that focus the objectives of protection on valued ecosystem services in the agricultural context.
ERAs for GM crops typically consider a range of areas of assessment: (1) persistence and invasiveness of the crop, (2) effects on non-target organisms, (3) effects on soil (e.g. Devos et al. 2013; Raybould et al. 2010). Some countries specify additional areas of assessment in their regulations. For each area of assessment, specific operational protection goals can be defined. Ideally, these protection goals should be defined by policymak- ers, because this would ensure consistency among regulatory submissions as they would be based on the same set of operational protection goals. However, in most countries this is not the case. Risk assessors face having to formulate operational protection goals based on their interpretation of policy protection goals and what they consider relevant about the product under assessment. In these cases, an open dialogue between the scientists conducting the risk assessment and the risk managers making decisions is crucial so that key operational protection goals can be agreed before the assessment begins. This will increase the value of the ERA by providing the information necessary for decision making.
Formulating assessment endpoints, risk hypothesis and measurement endpoints
Once the operational protection goals for each area of assessment are defined, assessment endpoints associ- ated with a particular goal can be formulated: ‘‘Assess- ment endpoints are specific entities and their attributes that are at risk and that are expressions of a manage- ment goal’’ (USEPA 2003). Not all valued organisms or ecosystem features can be studied, therefore assessment endpoints are carefully selected usually based on ecological relevance, susceptibility (likely exposure
plus likely sensitivity), and relevance to policy protec- tion goals. Selecting appropriate assessment endpoints is a critical step in ensuring that an ERA will be useful to risk managers in making informed and scientifically defensible environmental decisions.
Assessment endpoints are identified during the problem formulation phase of environmental risk assessment (Gray 2012; Raybould 2006; Wolt et al. 2010). This process is well described by Sanvido et al. (2012) and Nienstedt et al. (2012). Specific assessment endpoints comprise the following components:
(a) The entity to be protected (e.g., non-target arthropods species or functional groups)
(b) The attributes or functions of those entities to be protected (abundance, function).
(c) The unit of protection (individuals, populations, function)
(d) A spatial unit of protection (such as ‘‘GM crop fields’’, ‘‘other arable land’’, and ‘‘non-agricul- tural habitats’’).
A temporal scale of protection (such as the present cropping season, the following cropping season, or the time approved for cultivation of the GM crop).
Sometimes, the definition of an assessment endpoint includes definitions of adverse effects, such as the direction or size of change to the specified attributes.
There could be several assessment endpoints asso- ciated with one operational protection goal. The number will be determined during problem formula- tion where the ecological entities to be protected will be identified.
It is important to remember that assessment endpoints are not the same as measurement endpoints. While assessment endpoints define what is going to be assessed to determine the probability that an adverse effect relating to the protection goal will occur, measurement endpoints are the results of studies that test hypotheses about the effects on an assessment endpoint of exposure to a stressor (Fig. 1). Assessment endpoints are, therefore, evaluated but not necessarily measured during the risk assessment.

goals two examples are given below. The examples represent two of the assessment areas that are com- monly considered in ERAs to support applications for the cultivation of GM crops in most regulatory frameworks around the world: persistence and inva- siveness and effects on non-target organisms.
Persistence and invasiveness
One feature that is often considered in ERAs for GM crops is the persistence and invasiveness of the crop, which in some regulatory systems is referred to as its ‘‘weediness potential’’. The concern is that the genetic modification may have changed the phenotype of the crop making it more ‘‘weedy’’ than the conventional crop leading to harm to agriculture, or biodiversity, or both. There are two common concerns:
• The GM crop will be more persistent than the conventional crop in cropped areas, resulting in increased numbers of volunteers appearing the following year causing agronomic problems such as yield loss or increased costs of control.
• The GM crop will be more invasive than the conventional crop in areas outside the crop, resulting in displacement of local plant species and associated fauna, thus having an adverse impact on biodiversity.
Areas outside the crop could be in-field and under management (e.g., field margins), or outside the field and unmanaged (Alix and Coulson 2012; Herman et al. 2013). These definitions are discussed in more detail in ‘‘Non-target organisms’’ and Fig. 2, below. For convenience, the off-crop area is considered as a single entity. In reality, there may be many distinct off-crop areas with varying protection goals.
Another often-mentioned concern is that the trans- genes in the GM crop will be transferred to sexually compatible wild plant species. For many crops in many countries this is highly unlikely as sexually compatible relatives of the crop do not occur in the wild (e.g., Raybould and Gray 1993; Stewart et al. 2003). If hybridisation occurs and introgression of the genes is possible, the concern is that conferred new traits will render the wild relatives more persistent in cultivated crop areas, becoming an agronomic prob- lem, or more invasive in areas outside the crop having an adverse impact on biodiversity.
Using the ecosystem services approach, operational protection goals can be defined in order to clarify the concerns and the hypotheses to be tested. In this example, the key ecosystem services to protect would be food production (provisioning service) and biodi- versity (supporting and cultural service). There are two distinct spatial areas of protection: in-field and off-field. Whilst in the in-field area the main goal is to protect agricultural production (ensuring that the planting of the GM crop will not compromise the productivity of the crop and subsequent crops). In the off-field area the main goal is to protect native plant species and animals that may rely on them. Consid- ering the different entities of protection and the different spatial contexts the following operational

Transgenic Res (2014) 23:945–956
949
 protection goals can be defined. The definition can be expressed in many different ways provided that the entities of protection are made clear, what are they protected from and where (spatial context). Examples are given below:
1. The cultivation of GM crop X in country Y should not result in worse agronomic problems in man- aged crop areas as a result of increased persistence of the GM crop compared with cultivation of non- GM varieties of this crop.
2. The cultivation of GM crop X in country Y should not result in harm to biodiversity in natural habitats as a result of increased invasiveness of the GM crop compared with cultivation of non- GM varieties of this crop.
3. The cultivation of the GM crop X in country Y should not result in agronomic problems in managed crop areas as a result of increased persistence of wild relatives of the GM crop that have acquired the GM trait.
4. The cultivation of GM crop X in country Y should not result in harm to biodiversity in natural habitats as a result of increased invasiveness of wild relatives of the GM crop that have acquired the GM trait.
The first and third operational goals refer to the
protection of agricultural production and the provi- sioning ecosystem service. The second and fourth goals refer to protection of biodiversity, which may comprise a cultural ecosystem service itself, or provide provisioning, regulating or supporting services.
Once operational protection goals are defined, assessment endpoints can be formulated. These are more specific than the operational protection goals as they include information on the entity to be protected, the attribute and, where possible, spatial and temporal scales and magnitude. Examples of assessment end- points are given below:
• Establishment of volunteer populations of the GM crop in the managed crop area causing harm to agricultural production in the next crop following the cultivation of the GM plant.
• Establishment of populations of sexually compat- ible wild relatives that have acquired the GM trait of the GM plant in managed crop areas causing harm to agricultural production in the next crop following the cultivation of the GM plant.
Providing a timescale for protecting displacement of native plant species in natural habitats may prove more difficult as it will depend on the crop under assessment and the ecology of the compatible wild relatives. However, the problem formulation step takes into account this information and helps estab- lishing an appropriate temporal scale.
Defining the assessment endpoints during problem formulation allows risk assessors to predict the probability and extent of adverse effects on those endpoints. This does not necessarily mean that specific tests or studies have to be conducted to predict adverse effects, because there may be enough information on the crop biology and the nature of the trait to provide sufficient evidence to characterise risk.
For most GM crops a comparative assessment of agronomic and phenotypic characteristics is con- ducted. These studies test the hypothesis that the genetic modification has not changed the phenotype of the donor crop such that cultivation of the GM crop is more likely to lead to adverse effects on the assess- ment endpoints than is cultivation of the comparator non-GM crop. Measurement endpoints indicative of persistence or invasiveness are included in the study (Table 1). Therefore during problem formulation, a compilation of information on the crop biology, the trait and the comparative assessment may be sufficient to assess the probability of adverse effects on some of the assessment endpoints. If further tests of the hypothesis are needed to increase confidence or reduce uncertainty further data may be acquired.
Non-target organisms
Another area of assessment often considered in ERAs for GM crops is the effect that the use of the GM crop may have on non-target organisms. The definition of non-target organism (NTO) for ERAs of GM crops has been a point of discussion for many years. For GM crops that produce traits aimed at pest control, non- target organisms are considered as all organisms not targeted by the trait. There are many GM crops that do not produce pesticidal traits. Nevertheless, many regulatory frameworks require an assessment of the risk to non-target organisms from their use. The definition of non-target organisms as those not specifically targeted by the trait causes problems for two reasons. First, not all organisms are valued equally; for example, pests not targeted by the crop

Use of several varieties helps to set in context any differences between the GM and non-GM near-isolines

 probably have lower value than pollinators. Secondly, not all organisms can be assessed explicitly in the ERA. The objective of protection should therefore be selected carefully (USEPA 2003). The ecosystem services approach can be very useful in clarifying these objectives. We will focus on the assessment of non-target arthropods (NTAs) to keep the example relatively simple.
The policy protection goals that would apply to the ERA of NTAs in most jurisdictions are the protection of biodiversity and protection of agricultural produc- tion. When translating these policy protection goals to operational protection goals it is important to remem- ber that agricultural landscapes are heterogeneous: they are a combination of managed crop areas and unmanaged ‘‘natural’’ areas in which different protec- tion goals may apply (Herman et al. 2013).
In the regulatory framework for registration of plant protection products in the EU, there have been many joint activities between regulators, academics and industry to harmonize the approaches for environ- mental risk assessments of non-target arthropods (NTA). The latest activity was the production of the ESCORT 3 document, which aimed at harmonizing approaches to ERA of pesticides by linking NTA effects testing with protection goals (Alix and Coulson 2012). The ESCORT 3 document provides definitions of the different areas considered in agricultural areas:
• In-crop area: area surface covered by the crop plants including the space between the crop rows.
• In-field area: the in-field area comprises the in- crop area and its boundaries that are managed by the farmer in the context of the crop management.
• Off-crop area: area where the product is not
intentionally applied.
• Off-field area: area surrounding the in-field area
excluding neighbouring in-field areas.
The consensus of the ESCORT 3 working group was that in the in-field area (the area managed by the farmer, including the crop and its immediate sur- roundings), the main policy protection goal is agri- cultural production. In this area, the focus is on the ecological functions that support the provisioning service of crop production. In the off-field area, the main policy protection goal is the maintenance of biodiversity to provide cultural, regulating and sup- porting services. The main interest in biodiversity in managed crop areas is the encouragement of beneficial
NTA species and the reduction of harmful species, such as pests. Thus there is an interest in reducing diversity (weeds and pests) while protecting valued functions. The approach to NTA biodiversity protec- tion is therefore different in in-field and off-field areas: while in-field areas the focus may be on ‘‘functional biodiversity’’ (sufficient individuals of the type to maintain functions, regardless of their species), in off- field areas the focus is on ‘‘structural biodiversity’’ (the abundance of particular species) (Moonen and Barberi 2008).
In in-field areas, the main aim is to protect provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. The main reason for the existence of crops is the production of food, feed and other products for human use; therefore, provisioning is the overarching ecosystem service. Regulating services provided by NTA, such as pollination, pest and disease regulation by biological control and decomposition are important in helping the crop to realise its provisioning role. The NTAs that contribute to a particular service can be very varied; some ecological functions underlying ecosystem services are provided by a range of species, others may be more specialised and may be fulfilled by fewer species. The regulating and supporting services can therefore be protected at different levels: abun- dance of species that are key contributors to the function, diversity of species that contribute to the same function or the function itself.
In off-field areas, the main aim is to protect populations of NTAs that are charismatic, endangered or protected. These species may rely on regulating and supporting services provided by other species in the off-crop area. Furthermore, organisms that grow and reproduce in off-field areas and forage in in-field areas contributing to the regulating ecosystem service in- field may also be regarded as important.
It is worth noting that in some countries, where large amounts of land are devoted to either urban or agricultural areas with small proportions of wild areas, the protection of charismatic and protected species in in-field areas is also considered an important protec- tion goal. This can be considered in the ERA and included as an assessment endpoint where overlap between protected or endangered species and in-crop or in-field areas can be assessed.
Considering the different entities of protection and the different spatial contexts, operational protection goals can be defined. As discussed in the previous
123

952

 example, the definitions can be expressed in many different ways provided that the entities of protection are clear. Examples of in-field and off-field opera- tional protection goals are given below:
1. In-field:
The cultivation of GM crop X in country Y should not result in adverse effects on regulating ecosys- tem functions provided by NTAs in managed crop areas (in-field) compared with cultivation of non- GM varieties of this crop.
2. Off-field:
The cultivation of the GM crop X in country Y should not result in adverse effects on NTAs of key conservation value in off-field areas com- pared with cultivation of non-GM varieties of this crop.
Once operational protection goals are defined,
assessment endpoints can be formulated. These are more specific than the operational protection goals as they include information on the entity to be protected (e.g. species, populations or functions), the attribute (abundance, function), the spatial scale (in-field, off- field) and where possible the temporal scale (during the season, the following season, during the time of product approval). These points are illustrated below:
• Adverse effects on regulating ecosystem functions provided by NTAs (pollination, decomposition, predation...) in managed crop areas (in field) during cultivation of the GM crop or in the following season.
• Adverse effects on populations of NTAs that provide regulating ecosystem functions (pollina- tion, decomposition, pest control...) in managed crop (in-field) areas during cultivation of the GM crop or in the following season.
• Population decline of valued NTAs in off-field areas during cultivation of the GM crop or in the following season.
The first assessment endpoint focuses the assess- ment on ecological functions, whereas the second focuses on populations of NTAs that are known to be major contributors or representatives of regulating functions. The third assessment endpoint focuses the assessment on populations of valued NTAs off-field. The temporal scale to consider will depend on policy objectives. If the objective is for ecological functions to be unchanged at the start of the following growing
season, the risk assessment would consider the potential for recovery of NTAs if reduced abundance during cultivation of the GM crop were predicted. If temporary reductions in function were unacceptable, the assessment might consider only the probability of reduced abundance of NTAs during cultivation of the GM crop.
Defining the assessment endpoints during problem formulation allows risk assessors to predict changes that are relevant for characterising risk; that is, potentially harmful changes instead of all possible changes. One of the key steps in predicting potentially harmful changes is identifying hazards. For GM crops that produce proteins intended for pest or disease control, the assessment usually focuses on the char- acterization of the adverse effects of the pesticidal proteins produced and the levels of exposure of the entities of protection. However, there may be a concern that the genetic modification has unintention- ally altered the crop in ways that are harmful to NTAs. For this reason, one of the first steps during problem formulation for all GM crops is to establish whether there are unintended changes in the GM crop that could cause environmental harm.
Assessment of risks posed by unintended changes follows a weight of evidence approach where different sources of information are used as there is no single study that can establish if unintended changes that could be harmful have occurred (Garcia-Alonso 2010). The assessment takes into account information from the molecular characterization conducted on the event and from comparisons of composition and agronomic and phenotypic characteristics.
The molecular characterization provides a first check to assess whether the sequence inserted is as intended or changes have occurred after transforma- tion. It also allows identification of the insertion site and assessment of whether any genes that control important plant functions have been disrupted or if there are any open reading frames that could result in the production of proteins other than the ones intended. However, some molecular changes may not translate into phenotypic changes, therefore com- parisons of phenotypic characteristics are usually given more weight in the ERA (Macdonald 2012).
Comparison of composition and agronomic char- acteristics allow assessment of whether important phenotypic characteristics have been inadvertently modified. If unintended differences are detected, their
123

953
 potential to cause environmental harm is assessed. If no indications of potentially harmful unintended changes are identified through this process, the assessment can focus on the assessing the hazard and exposure of intended differences between the GM crop and the non-GM counterpart to valued environmental entities or attributes (Garcia-Alonso 2010).
During problem formulation, the risk assessor should use existing relevant information. It is possible that information already available can be used to characterise risk sufficiently to address concerns about the relevant assessment endpoints (Romeis et al. 2009). Specific tests or studies only have to be conducted when problem formulation indicates that they are needed. On many occasions, endpoints measured in one study can be used to address different assessment endpoints. For example, if studies have been conducted on surrogate NTO species to assess the effects of the GM crop on NTOs or functions valued in in-field areas, these data can be used to assess the effects on NTOs off-field, as the species will also be representative for those and exposure levels off-field will be much lower than in-field. As discussed above, in some countries policy protection goals aim at protecting farmland biodiversity, which includes protection of protected or charismatic NTA species in in-field areas. In this case, a relevant assessment endpoint that may be considered, in addition to those listed above, could be: ‘‘Population decline of pro- tected or charismatic NTAs in in-field areas during cultivation of the GM crop or in the following season’’. Information on potential exposure to these organisms can be gathered to establish whether these species will indeed be exposed to the GM crop and, if so, exposure pathways and potential harm can be established to determine whether further data is necessary.
For GM crops that produce proteins for pest or disease control, the ERA focuses on the probability and seriousness of harmful side effects on NTAs from the intended production of those proteins. The general hypothesis under test is that at concentrations pro- duced in the crop during cultivation the proteins have no harmful effects on NTAs. Testing this hypothesis involves comparing the predicted exposure to the protein of various functional groups of NTAs with measurements of the effects of the protein on organism that are representative of those groups (Raybould and Vlachos 2011). There are two important criteria for being representative. First, a representative organism
is exposed to the protein through a similar route to the organisms it represents. Secondly, a representative organism has similar or greater sensitivity to the protein than do members of the group that are not tested but are likely to be exposed. In other words, the effects of the protein on a representative species provide conservative predictions about the effects on other species in the group (Raybould 2006).
Conservative predictions about exposure may be made from measurements of protein concentrations in plants grown in the field (see, for example, Raybould and Vlachos 2011). Information about effects of the proteins is usually obtained from laboratory studies using purified protein produced in microbes (Ray- bould et al. 2013). Data from such studies are applicable to any crop producing the same or similar proteins at concentrations similar to or less than those in the study (Romeis et al. 2009). Therefore, new effects studies may not be needed to complete a risk assessment.
If specific studies are considered necessary, a tiered-testing approach is followed (Garcia-Alonso et al. 2006; Romeis et al. 2006, 2008), carefully selecting relevant NTA species or functions (Romeis et al. 2013), well designed tests (Romeis et al. 2011) and appropriate measurement endpoints (Sanvido et al. 2012). Thus the measurement endpoints will be selected case-by-case, depending on the problem formulation for the GM crop under assessment. Depending on the assessment endpoints selected and the hypothesis tested, measurement endpoints for assessing adverse effects on regulating ecosystem services provided by NTAs in managed crop areas may aim at direct measurements of a particular ecological function (for example measuring the rate of predation of sentinel eggs) or indirect measure- ments (for example measuring whether exposure to the protein produced by the GM crop leads to lethal effects on an NTA representative of the ecological function). Some examples can be found in Table 2.
Discussion
Policy protection goals are set up in most countries to minimise harm to the environment, humans and animals caused by human activities. Therefore, these protection goals must be taken into account when conducting environmental risk assessments (ERAs) to

b Often laboratory or field studies with protected or endangered species a not permitted. Nevertheless, potential exposure and sensitivity can be predicted to assess potential risk
Problem formulation is always considered to determine whether specific studies with NTAs will have to be conducted. If this is the
support regulatory approvals for agricultural biotech- nology products. However, policy protection goals set in the legislation are often stated in very broad terms and are too ambiguous to be directly applicable in ERAs. Closing the risk assessment—policy gap requires translation of policy objectives into unam- biguous attributes that may be measured or predicted scientifically. In other words, the objectives must be made operational. In the context of environmental risk, policy objectives are the avoidance of harm to the environment, and are called protection goals. Making protection goals operational is, therefore, fundamental to good environmental risk assessment and improving decision-making.
In this paper, we offer proposals on how to make protection goals operational for the environmental risk assessment of GM crops. We begin with very general objectives that are likely to be relevant in most countries: protection of sustainable agricultural pro- duction and protection of biodiversity. From these objectives, we derive statements of operational pro- tection goals. These statements have several features in common: they refer to cultivation of a specific GM crop in a given country; they refer to specific habitats within the country—in-field or off-field; and they state that relative to cultivation of non-GM varieties, cultivation of the GM crop should not have adverse effects on ecological functions or organisms

955
 supporting the most relevant ecosystem service(s) in that habitat.
From the operational protection goals, we derive definitions of assessment endpoints. These definitions specify the environmental entities and their attributes that are to be protected, and the spatial and temporal extent of protection. Adverse effects above a certain threshold on assessment endpoints may be taken to indicate harm.
Assessment endpoints are crucial as they are the point at which the risk policy—gap may be closed. They are operational definitions of environmental policy and are the basis for formulating scientific hypotheses to be tested in the risk assessment. At their most general, these hypotheses predict that the intended cultivation of the GM crop will not have adverse effects on the assessment endpoint; that is, it will not reduce the abundance of an NTO, or reduce an ecosystem function, that supports the primary ecosystem service(s) in the relevant habitat. The testing of these hypotheses is the scientific basis of risk assessment.
Testing consists of acquiring data (values of mea- surement endpoints) that can show whether the hypothesis may be true or false. If the hypothesis is that cultivation of an insect-resistant GM crop will have no adverse effects on biological control, a suitable test is exposure of a representative NTA in the laboratory to concentrations of the insecticidal protein greater than or equal to those predicted in the field. If no adverse effects are observed, the hypothesis is corrob- orated. Should rigorous tests—conditions under which the hypotheses are most likely to be false—corroborate the hypotheses, one may conclude that cultivation of the GM crop poses negligible environmental risk (Raybould 2006). If adverse effects are observed, the hypothesis may be false, and further testing under more realistic conditions may be undertaken to evaluate it. This is the basis of tiered risk assessment (Garcia- Alonso et al. 2006; Romeis et al. 2008).
The scheme we propose ought to be generally applicable. However, its implementation may vary among countries owing to different priorities and interpretations of environmental and agricultural pol- icy objectives. Our definitions of operational protec- tion goals, assessment endpoints, risk hypotheses and measurement endpoints are illustrative not prescrip- tive. They illustrate the essential properties of the various stages of making protection goals operational; they cannot define how risk managers and assessors
must interpret the policies and regulations under which they work. Finally, our scheme does not offer definitions of the size of an adverse effect that should be considered harmful, nor does it suggest how trade- offs between various ecosystem services ought to be managed. These are essential for decision-making and risk management, but are matters for policy, not risk assessment procedures.
Conclusion
We hope that the methods suggested in this paper will help environmental risk assessors and risk managers to focus on the most significant questions: What is it that we are trying to protect? What effects would we regard as harmful? How may we quickly and confidently characterise environmental risk? How may we make effective decisions in a timely way? For too long, much discussion of environmental risks of GM crops has been conducted in scientific bubble, where scientists argue about the validity of certain studies. Good study design and interpretation are vital (Romeis et al. 2011). However, a study’s validity does not guarantee its relevance. A study is only relevant for risk assessment if it tests a hypothesis about environmental harm; and, therefore, operational definitions of protection goals are essential to judge a study’s relevance. Without a means to judge the relevance of studies, discussion of the environmental risks of cultivating GM crops will remain volatile because of the huge importance given to small effects in single laboratory studies. Methods to define operational protection goals are the first step towards a more substantial discussion of the environ- mental risks and opportunities of GM crops.

Foreword
The problems and constraints of finding sustainable solutions to end hun- ger and poverty in Africa are well documented. Agriculture is a criti-
cal sector in that quest, as it contributes approximately 35 percent of the continent’s GDP while accounting for 70 percent of its labor force. The sec- tor is also considered significant in the deployment of overall economic devel- opment strategies in the majority of African countries. While there has been some progress in improving African agriculture, productivity improvements are being overshadowed by new and in some cases increased challenges, such as population growth, a changing climate, and the fact that fewer than 30 percent of farmers have access to or use of improved seeds. In addition, technological innovations in use in other developing regions are proving difficult to institute or become accepted practice and policy in Africa—and policies for technolog- ical innovation will be essential to feeding Africa’s population in the future.
One promising, yet controversial, technological innovation is biotech- nology. Biotechnology tools, including genetically modified crops and other organisms, have produced valuable products that have been adopted by a large number of farmers globally, including those in Argentina, Brazil, China, and India. Genetically modified (GM) crops have been approved for commercial release in Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa, while contained and con- fined testing of them has been performed in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and other countries. Despite the documented benefits to farmers in developing countries, including those in Africa, many policymakers and farmers in Africa south of the Sahara remain hesitant about the use of GM crops, and they need more information about their potential, benefits, costs, and safety in the African context.

Calls to increase agricultural productivity, such as those found in the Maputo Declaration of 2003 and the statement from the African Union Summit of 2009, have not had an impact on the biotechnology debate, in spite of perceptions that biotechnology innovation has largely bypassed the region. While panels convened by the African Union to facilitate multi- stakeholder dialogue have recommended more policy research on economic, social, ethical, environmental, intellectual property, and trade issues relevant to Africa, only limited progress has been made.
The International Food Policy Research Institute organized the conference “Bringing Economic Analysis to Inform Biotechnology and Biosafety Policies in Africa” in Entebbe, Uganda, in May 2009 to take stock of economic and policy research focused on biotechnology in Africa and to identify relevant issues to help guide future research. This book brings together the papers writ- ten for, and presentations made at, that conference.
The agricultural productivity challenges facing Africa will require a pro- active response and vigilant evaluation of biotechnology and its many tools. Genetically Modified Crops in Africa is meant to help policymakers assess whether and how biotechnology can contribute sustainable solutions to end- ing hunger and poverty in Africa.

Introduction and Background
José Falck-Zepeda, Guillaume Gruère, and Idah Sithole-Niang
Despite multiple internal and external investment efforts, Africa south of the Sahara (SSA) has not been completely successful in facing its agri- cultural and development constraints. This state of affairs has been
complicated with the rise of increasingly complex constraints on the conti- nent. The convergence of population growth, increased food production vul- nerability, rising climatic variability, governance and political instability, and delayed investments to overcome environmental and agricultural productiv- ity constraints appears to have thwarted agricultural development efforts. The region’s vulnerability to these binding constraints on food security, as well as on economic growth and prosperity, can be seen in the fact that SSA is still enduring the impacts of the global food and financial crises that occurred
in 2008 (IMF 2009; Arieff, Weiss, and Jones 2010; Brambila-Macias and Massa 2010).
Africa at the Crossroads
Indeed, the persistent impact of the global food and financial crises on SSA highlights the need for increased investments in the development of robust and resilient agricultural, food, fiber, and energy production systems. Increased investments focused on improving such systems can help address these coun- tries’ development challenges. Yet the historical record of investments in this area is littered with ambitious—and in many cases, failed—development plans, policies, and interventions. Easterly (2009) suggests that SSA focus on fea- sible, but homegrown, development interventions that seek solutions to spe- cific problems.
Raising agricultural productivity is considered one of the most impor- tant ways to help develop a robust and resilient agriculture and to increase rural income (World Bank 2007). Many examples exist of successful inter- ventions supporting agricultural development that have been built upon sci- ence, innovation, and the use of productivity-raising technologies (Spielman and Pandya-Lorch 2009). Among the broad set of available science and
 1

2 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
technology interventions, genetically engineered (GE) crops1 present an option that could help increase agricultural productivity, improve income, and contribute to achieving the goals of broader poverty alleviation and national development policies (FAO 2004).
The potential role of GE crops in addressing the continent’s constraints has been recognized in Africa ( Juma and Serageldin 2007). Accumulated expe- rience and knowledge in Africa and other developing countries (see Qaim 2009; Smale et al. 2009; Pontifical Academy of Sciences 2010; Potrykus and
Ammann 2010; Areal, Riesgo, and Rodriguez-Cerezo 2012) suggest that avail- able GE crops in the short and medium term may have significant value for
African agriculture. Yet their development and use remain controversial in many countries in SSA and in other developing countries. This is partly due
to an incomplete understanding of the appropriate development role for GE crops and other biotechnologies that are products of nascent innovation sys- tems in the subregion. Valuing the development potential for the introduction of GE crops in SSA must account for their potential development interven- tions within the scope of broader poverty alleviation efforts and national development policies, taking into account the economic and political contexts.
Like most technological interventions, GE crops will not solve all SSA devel- opment problems, nor will all available GE crops be useful—or appropriate— in the African context. Instead, African decisionmakers will need to evaluate
the specific value of each GE crop as a tool in the portfolio of potential inter- ventions that may be made available to farmers in the region. GE crops may be particularly important if they help solve specific crop productivity constraints
in Africa. This is true especially of those productivity constraints that have
not been resolved by conventional means, including conventional plant breed- ing, integrated pest management, and in those situations where other control/ productivity enhancement approaches may not be accessible to farmers.
To identify potential beneficial technologies, an assessment of economic impacts is called for, which includes analyses at the farm, national, and inter- national levels. In any such priority-setting exercise, the institutional setting needs to be accounted for, as it may have an impact on adoption, technology use, and output marketing by farmers in developing countries (see, for example,
1 Here we use the label “GE” for transgenic crops or products derived thereof, because it is one of the most commonly employed term used in the literature and public media. Other equally im- precise terms (such as genetically modified (GM) crops derived from modern biotechnology) could be used instead, and may be used interchangeably in the book. In this book we focus on GE crops, yet many of the issues discussed here apply to animals, arthropods and other insects, and microorganisms, which may become available in SSA.
 
Tripp 2009). So far, there are only limited examples of GE crop impact assess- ment. Smale et al. (2009) review the economic literature assessing GE crops in African and other developing countries’ agriculture, including their impact on
farmers, households, communities, and trade, and the institutional context in which these technologies may be deployed for potential use by farmers. They draw the four following lessons.
• On average, adoption has been profitable to users—but averages mask vari- ability in agroclimates, host cultivars, and farming practices.
• There are too few traits under study, and too few cases and authors— generalizations should not be drawn. More time is needed to describe the effects of adoption.
• During the next decade, practitioners will need to address cross- cutting issues for further study, such as impacts on poverty, gender, and public health.
• To address broader issues, impact assessment practitioners need to develop improved methods and draw from multidisciplinary collaborations.
Similar lessons have been reported in Qaim (2009, 2010); in recent meta- analyses of impact assessment studies of insect-resistant cotton by Finger et al. (2011); and for all GE crops in Areal, Riesgo, and Rodriguez-Cerezo et al. (2012).
The relatively limited research on the impact of GE crops implies that its contribution to the policy debate on GE crops and biotechnology in the con- tinent has also been limited. Moreover, the policy debate is being undermined because much of the discussion in Africa has yielded to external (and in some cases to internal) pressures to move away from science and rational debate and discussion, toward either antagonistic or unconditionally supportive views on GE crops (Novy et al. 2011; Takeshima and Gruère 2011). These polarized views generally lack robust data and evidence-based policy analysis, contribut- ing to confusion about the real or potential value of GE crops for Africa’s agri- culture, especially in African policy debates.
This book is an attempt to move the discussion away from polarized posi- tions. It aims to contribute to a rational debate on the actual benefits, costs, and risks of existing and future GE crops and technologies for Africa. To accomplish this goal, we introduce a broad set of contributions documenting issues relevant to the current African policy debate. These contributions are representative of the state-of-the-art knowledge about GE biotechnologies in

Africa. We also include references to other papers and materials relevant to the debate when appropriate, which may help elucidate important questions for the proper assessment of GE crops and similar technologies in Africa.
The following sections aim at setting the stage for the policy debate on
GE crops. We briefly present the status of GE crop adoption and capacity in Africa. We then list a number of key potential constraints and describe some of the internal positions on biotechnology.
GE Crops: “Miracle Crops” or “Frankenfoods”?
GE crops have been portrayed unequivocally by those opposing or promot- ing the technology as either the solution for feeding the world, or in some instances, as crops that would bring environmental and social catastrophes
of incalculable consequences (Brac de la PerriFre and Seuret 2000; GRAIN 2004). Stone (2002) documents that such contrasting positions can and do obscure many of the complexities involved in GE crop adoption and their use in developing countries. A more balanced position would consider GE crops neither as Frankenfoods nor as Miracle Crops per se, but rather as a set of tech- nologies with unique attributes, different from past innovations, such as the Green Revolution’s maize and wheat varieties. In particular, many of these technologies have been produced using research and development (R&amp;D) inputs that are protected intellectual property, and most technologies now available commercially have been developed by the private sector.
These attributes need to be characterized, discussed, and in some cases addressed to ensure their compatibility with and support of poverty allevia- tion efforts, especially in the agricultural context of SSA. Furthermore, there is a need to clearly separate the intrinsic production, productivity, and socio- economic impacts of GE crops from more general concerns expressed by some stakeholders over forced industrialization, corporate control of agriculture, and the impact of technology on traditional farmers and agricultural prac- tices and communities. The latter implies the need to conduct in-depth social and institutional context analysis in which these varieties may be or have been released to farmers to ensure that society can determine the potential role of GE crops in development and poverty alleviation efforts (Stone 2011). This is especially important in the African context.
Stakeholder Support for GE Crops
GE crop supporters present these technologies as a distinct option to pro- mote food security and sustainable agriculture for developing countries. GE

crops open the possibility of addressing biotic and abiotic constraints to food, feed, and fiber production. GE crops may, for example, enhance pro- ductivity, improve pest and weed control, and increase tolerance to drought and salinity. These crops may also improve public health through reductions in pesticide applications and through enhanced nutrition, such as vitamin
A–enhanced rice that is currently being evaluated in a number of develop- ing countries. Yet different stakeholders have contrasting positions toward these technologies.
Stakeholder Criticisms of GE Crops
Some stakeholders often cite the fact that existing GE crops were largely devel- oped by the private sector for use in industrialized countries in an intensive and commercially focused agriculture. The consequence of this approach, in their view, is that existing GE crops are inappropriate for traditional agricul- ture as practiced in Africa and other developing countries. They believe that this approach empowers private firms to exercise monopoly power and thus price the technology at a higher level than in a competitive market (Moschini and Lapan 1997; Falck-Zepeda, Traxler, and Nelson 2000). Private sector–led agricultural R&amp;D is a different pathway than that taken by previous agricul- tural innovation processes, which have been driven mostly by the public sec- tor. The private sector–led R&amp;D investments and continued control over GE crops is seen by some commentators as one more example of corporate control of agriculture and its activities.
Other issues have been raised, such as the “contamination” of traditional varieties due to pollen flow, uncontrolled gene dispersion, impacts on trade, disruption of traditional communities and livelihoods, dependency on pri- vate sector, production risk increasing due to the rise of monocultures, and the decline of smallholder crop diversification.2 These concerns may or may not be unique to GE crops. They may also belong to a larger set of general con- cerns over the role of science and technology in contributing to poverty alle- viation and development. Furthermore, it is not always clear whether these

In some cases and under a relatively complex set of conditions, the introduction of modern varieties—including GE crops—can introduce the potential for private firms exercising monop- oly power over resource-poor households and farmers in developing countries. This outcome is valid but dependent on a set of conditions that determine its likelihood. In particular, it is a pos- sible scenario where market conditions are such that they force farmers in developing countries to become members of captive markets with little or no choice for a diversity of crop varieties or other production alternatives. Therefore conventional or traditional varieties preserved by farm- ers could disappear over time (Munro 2003; Knezevic 2007).

6 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
concerns apply to existing technologies or to proposed technologies in the development pipeline for the African context.
Toward a More Balanced Approach
Certainly, some of these stakeholder concerns and issues may be valid for some crops or incorporated traits through genetic engineering in some locations. In our view, each concern is an empirical issue that has to be identified and ana- lyzed as part of an ex ante assessment of GE crops before deliberate release into the environment.
A prudent approach would consider the relevant facts and then render a robust and complete analysis of the appropriateness of a specific technology for its intended target country or region. One cannot generalize that GE crops are either unequivocally Frankenfoods or Miracle Crops. A rational approach would require judging GE crops on a case-by-case basis while considering all the costs, benefits, and risks estimated through robust assessments.
Still, following Norman Borlaug’s and Jimmy Carter’s opinions (Paarlberg 2008), we believe that the GE crop assessment process, as it stands now,
needs to concentrate less on their potential risk (especially in the case of well- studied technologies where there is an established record of safety and use in other countries) and more on their actual impact and on their access by poor farmers. A redirected focus on development efforts is needed to ensure that poor farmers could benefit from the assessed, safe, relevant, and beneficial GE crops in their context. Separating generalized issues from the facts germane to useful GE crop development, deployment, access, and performance is one of the motivating factors behind this book.
GE Crop Adoption: The Reality behind the Numbers
The area planted to GE crops has increased at a rapid pace since the release of the first commercial crops in the United States and China. As of 2011, there were approximately 160 million hectares worldwide cultivated with the crops ( James 2011). Yet the growth in area planted continues to be focused mainly on four crops (soybeans, maize, cotton, and canola) and two traits (herbicide tolerance and insect resistance). Small areas in several countries have been planted with other crops, including alfalfa, beans, tomatoes, petunias, papayas, potatoes, sweet peppers, squash, carnations, and sugar beets.
Developing countries cultivate approximately 50 percent of the global area devoted to GE crops, totaling close to 80 million hectares. Importantly,

the share planted by developing countries has been increasing over time and may even become higher than that of developed countries ( James 2011). As shown in Figure I.1, developing countries with the highest area planted in 2011 included Brazil (30.3 million hectares), Argentina (23.7 million), India (10.6 million), China (3.9 million), Paraguay (2.8 million), and Pakistan (2.6 million).
In 2011, the share of GE crops planted in Africa was small. Africa’s share was less than 1.6 percent of the total area planted to GE crops (see Figure I.2). Similar to the evolution across all developing countries, the area planted by African countries has been increasing over time. Furthermore, the number of crops in the product development and the biosafety regulatory pipeline and those that have been commercialized have also been increasing over time in the continent. The need then exists to examine the current status of GE crops in the product development and regulatory pipelines as a necessary background to understand the issues discussed in this book. The next section addresses these issues in some detail.

Africa’s Biotechnology Capacity, Biosafety Status, and Adoption Impact
The status of biosafety regulatory frameworks and of GE crop technologies play a role in the observed low level of GE crop adoption in Africa. Currently, there are no completely indigenous GE crop technologies generated in Africa that we are aware of, except possibly in Egypt. Most technologies under devel- opment for SSA use genetic constructs or transformation procedures devel- oped elsewhere, and plant germplasm materials are usually selected and developed internally in the country of interest.
Biosafety Regulatory Framework Status
The foundation of biosafety regulatory systems, the national biosafety framework (NBF), includes policies, laws, and implementation regula-
tions. Countries implement their national biosafety framework by mobiliz- ing human, financial, and technical capacities in the country, which permits agents to conduct a biosafety assessment and then submit a recommendation, or in some cases, a decision.
Figure I.3 presents a map of the status of NBFs in Africa as of 2009. Their status in this figure is described as functional, interim, work in

progress, and nonexistent, depending on the degree of evolution shown by countries at that particular point in time. It should be noted that in this fig- ure, even if an NBF has been described as “functional,” it does not neces- sarily mean that the country has approved a GE crop for deliberate release. Country statuses have not changed much since this figure was developed.
There were two relevant developments: Uganda has approved several con- fined field trials and is developing a formal policy, and Nigeria has approved a policy and is in the process of developing implementation regulations and approving confined field trials.
At the same time, the biosafety regulatory development process has evolved sufficiently to permit confined field trials in Burkina Faso, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, and commercialization release in Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa. The ability to conduct confined field tri-
als is a parameter that helps document biosafety assessment capacity as it is

usually, but not always, a first step before the process of assessment for com- mercial release. Applications for confined field trials are pending in many more countries.
Biotechnology Product Development/Regulatory Pipeline
Table I.1 lists GE crop technologies under product development or biosafety regulatory assessment. The number of GE crops is expanding beyond the four crops with two traits planted as the dominant share of global GE crop area; the number of countries testing and approving them is also expanding. A note- worthy development is the rise of crops of special interest to some countries in
Africa, including bananas, sweet potatoes, cowpeas, and cassava. Furthermore, the number of traits in development is also increasing. These include resis- tance to fungal and viral diseases and tolerance to drought conditions.
GE Cotton and Maize Adoption and Socioeconomic Impact in Africa
According to the estimates of James (2011), in 2011, South Africa cultivated approximately 2.3 million hectares, Burkina Faso 0.3 million hectares, and Egypt less than 0.05 million hectares of GE crops. Maize and cotton account for most of the area planted to GE crops in Africa.
More specifically, South Africa planted 2.3 million hectares of GE maize, cotton, and soybeans. Burkina Faso cultivated 300,000 hectares of insect- protected cotton (Bt) representing approximately 70 percent of total cotton area, which represents a significant increase from 2009, when roughly 25 percent of the area was planted to Bt cotton (James 2011). In Egypt, the actual area planted has been quite small since the commercialization approval granted by the com- petent authority in 2008. Much of the area planted has been for seed reproduc- tion purposes, although there are some reports that the expectation in Egypt is that area planted to GE maize will increase rapidly in the near future (Adenle 2011; James 2011).
The socioeconomic impact assessment literature on the effects of GE crops in SSA is relatively thin. As shown in Smale et al. (2009), much of the ex post assessment work has been done on measuring producer impacts from the adoption of GE crops, mostly focused on insect-resistant cotton in South
Africa, with a handful of reports from Burkina Faso. There is a small, but grow- ing, ex ante assessment body of literature for proposed technologies in Africa. Reports from South Africa and other developing countries that have adopted GE crops show that considerable spatial, temporal, and user variabilities exist and have an impact on results. These conclusions have been validated in a for- mal meta-analysis done by Finger et al. (2011).

14 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
From Concept to Farmers:
Issues for GE Crops in the African Context
This rapid review of the situation in SSA triggers a number of questions. Why aren’t more GE crops being deployed in Africa? Should we be seeing more GE crops being deployed in Africa? What are the appropriate crops and traits that may support smallholder agriculture in Africa? Will these technologies con- tribute to poverty alleviation efforts?
The answers proposed to these questions vary significantly in the literature. Current and future GE crops clearly face a number of deployment challenges. Some challenges are common to the dissemination of all new technologies
in SSA. Other challenges are unique to GE crops and may require innovative approaches for addressing these constraints in a meaningful way. In the next section, some of these issues are discussed in a technology framework chain with the intention of properly situating the issues, constraints, benefits, and other relevant issues to a decisionmaker in Africa.
Technology Development, Adaptation, and Dissemination Issues
SSA faces a situation where there is a growing but still insufficient level of investment in R&amp;D, especially in a select group of countries (Beintema and Stads 2010). The generalized level of R&amp;D investments in SSA translates into a relatively poor biotechnology innovative capacity. This in turn affects the capacity for conducting GE adaptive and targeted R&amp;D in the continent.
The low availability of human and financial resources in the region limits the overall innovative capacity to conduct R&amp;D and to develop indigenous GE crops. Unlike other crops, GE crops have to comply with biosafety regulations and be subject to risk assessments. To do so, countries have to sustain a suffi- cient decisionmaking capacity. Although many SSA countries are still lacking a regulatory framework or a scientific and regulatory capacity to implement such regulations, some notable efforts are underway to develop robust bio- safety systems.
National innovative capacity that can develop those GE traits of interest to national priorities has to be weighed against the possibility of accessing such technologies developed elsewhere. From a science and technology standpoint,
African decisionmakers can opt for different innovative capacity systems to deliver products to farmers. Some countries in Africa, though, lack even the minimal investments in R&amp;D capacity necessary to conduct adaptive R&amp;D in their own national research systems. Furthermore, some countries in the region have expressed a concern over the potential risks of these technologies to their farmers. Such concerns are not insurmountable hurdles, as there are

practical and feasible approaches that can empower countries to ensure an acceptable level of safety after a scientific assessment, while ensuring innova- tion and technology transfer to their farmers.
African seed systems and germplasm delivery mechanisms face a number of constraints that have been described in the literature. Technology delivery and dissemination are limited by institutional weaknesses and the insufficient development of national seed systems in Africa. These constraints are not unique to GE crop seeds. Yet they can be magnified as the need arises to ensure a working system that facilitates knowledge and information exchange about the use of the technology, and market signal transmissions, including price premiums or value-added paid for competing commodities in markets.
Developing an appropriate science and technology strategy that directs investments in R&amp;D capacity and strategy toward identified GE crops is criti- cal. To do so, the costs, benefits, and risks that GE technologies may pose to farmers need to be thoroughly examined, in order to select “best bet” strate- gies to address specific productivity constraints in Africa.
Obstacles Related to Adoption
Farmers considering the adoption of GE crops face many institutional chal- lenges. Access to credit and complementary inputs, their ability to manage production risk, and other binding institutional constraints play determinant roles in their decisions. A very important issue identified in a growing number of studies is farmers’ access to knowledge and information about the use of the technology and its market potential. Many of the GE crops available for adop- tion in and outside Africa have demonstrated their technical capability to pro- vide benefits to farmers. However, a farmer’s ability to tap into those potential benefits can be limited by institutional issues.
This calls for policymakers to consider supporting the policy and institu- tional environment to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of GE crop adoption in Africa. In this sense, the policy environment will strive to avoid potential cases of “technological triumphs but institutional failures” observed (Gouse et al. 2005, 1).
Marketing/Trade in Local and External Markets and Related Issues of Consumer Acceptance
The introduction and use of a GE crop in any country can potentially result in loss in export markets to trade-sensitive countries for the specific crop being considered. In some situations, African countries have argued that the potential approval and use of GE crops can even lead to the potential loss to unrelated
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 15

16 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
export markets. Although such perceptions may be misplaced, African coun- tries may face pressures by private buyers and consumer demand in trade- sensitive countries (Gruère and Sengupta 2009; Gruère and Takeshima 2012).
Market risks associated with potential external trade losses due to the adop- tion of GE crops are magnified by the growing trend in consumer concerns
in African countries, especially among urban consumers, and by labeling and related marketing requirements in some consumer-sensitive countries around the world, especially Europe, some countries in Asia, and the Middle East.
An additional issue is the increased possible trade losses associated with asyn- chronous or asymmetric approvals of GE crops. GE crops that are approved in one country but not in other trading partners can result in significant trade dis- ruptions. Because borders in Africa can be porous, and as regional trade increases within Africa, this issue may grow in importance. This calls for policies exam- ining potential export losses with trade-sensitive countries and across regions in
Africa to search for an adequate management strategy.
The trend toward a regionalization of biosafety assessment procedures and
the capacity to establish a regulatory decisionmaking process also require sup- port. Efforts such as those in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which seek regional approaches to biosafety assessments and in some cases to decisionmaking, will become more important with increasing trade activity at the subregional level.
Contrasting Stakeholder Positions in Africa
Although the problems can be identified, the complexity of the African politi- cal debate around GE products has to be accounted for. In particular, there are many contrasting positions with regard to GE crops in SSA. For example, the High-Level Panel on Biotechnology report commissioned by the African Union (AU) and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) states that
Africa needs to take strategic measures aimed at promoting the appli- cation of modern biotechnology to regional economic integration and trade. Such measures include fostering the emergence of regional inno- vation systems in which biotechnology-related Local Innovation Areas play a key role. [ Juma and Serageldin 2007, xix]
The AU/NEPAD Panel laid out some of the preconditions for taking advan- tage of GE crops to support economic development efforts, especially with

regard to regional economic coordination efforts to ensure proper and effi- cient regulatory assessment processes. Suggested by the AU/NEPAD Panel,
a regional approach to biotechnology and biosafety regulations is being pur- sued independently by COMESA and by the Economic Community of West
African States. These efforts are examining different modalities for devel- oping regional approaches to biosafety regulations that seek to address risk- assessment procedures combined with national or regional decisionmaking.
They do not represent an explicit endorsement of biotechnology or GE crops per se; rather, they open the possibility of examining these technologies on
a case-by-case basis.
In turn, in its official “Statement on Plant Breeding and Genetic Engineering,” the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) has this position with regard to GE crops and other organisms:
Our mission is not to advocate for or against the use of genetic engi- neering. We believe it is up to governments, in partnership with their citizens, to use the best knowledge available to put in place policies and regulations that will guide the safe development and acceptable use
of new technologies, as several African countries are in the process of doing. We will consider funding the development and deployment of such new technologies only after African governments have endorsed and provided for their safe use. Our mission is to use the wide variety of tools and techniques available now to make a dramatic difference for
Africa’s smallholder farmers as quickly as possible. [AGRA 2010]
AGRA’s position is basically neutral; it leaves any decision in terms of future investments pending on decisions taken at the national level. This decision contrasts with national developments. Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa have allowed the commercial cultivation of these crops by authorizing their deliberate release into the environment. More countries have approved con- fined field trials or have invested in the development of GE crops developed by the public sector for those issues of interest to African countries. This posi- tion also contrasts with that of countries that have explicit restrictive policies with regard to the importation of GE foods ranging from a complete ban on all imports (Zambia) to a ban on imports unless processed or milled (Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, and Zimbabwe).
Positions for or against the technology are not limited to the national level. Some organizations with stated missions that include social justice, biodiver- sity protection, small farmer livelihood assurance, and food security (such as the Third World Network, Via Campesina, Greenpeace, Oxfam, GRAIN, or
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 17

18 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Friends of the Earth International) have argued and conducted campaigns against the deployment of GE technologies in developing countries, including those in Africa. It is not always clear whether these organizations’ positions are against GE crops per se, an opposition to existing GE crops being deployed in developing countries, or a reaction to industrialization, multinational corpora- tion development, or privatization of agricultural research, but they are vocally opposed to GE crops.
Although some of these groups continue to push their own agendas, they may not have addressed the complex issues surrounding the potential intro- duction and dissemination of GE crops, including consideration of the poten- tial benefits from adoption and the reality that not adopting a GE crop could also have consequences (Pew Initiative on Biotechnology 2004). Although there may be some risks associated with the use of GE crops, the status quo in terms of conventional crops is not riskless either. The influence of donor and partner countries plays a key role in this area. So do trade relationships and various international pressure groups.
In fact, decisionmakers in SSA are bombarded with multiple, mostly con- flicting positions and messages about the appropriateness of GE crops in the
African context. The policy debate milieu grew to such a chaotic state that the AU’s declaration after its 2006 Ministerial Meeting included text that described the situation poignantly:
The two extreme positions have tended to confuse many African policy- makers and sections of the public because of the lack of reliable infor- mation and guidance available to these groups. There is uncertainty
and confusion in many of the African governments’ responses to a wide range of social, ethical, environmental, trade and economic issues associ- ated with the development and application of modern genetic engineer- ing. The absence of an African consensus and strategic approaches to address these emerging biotechnology issues has allowed different inter- est groups to exploit uncertainty in policymaking, regardless of what may be the objective situation for Africa. [African Union 2006, 1]
In this setting, policy research has a role to play in examining the potential and actual use of GE crops and related issues to its deployment. As an impor- tant African policymaker said at the 5th Conference of Parties of the Biosafety Protocol in Nagoya, Japan:
Given the lack of consensus amongst countries and the conflictive con- text, it is therefore imperative that any GE crop assessment work be

buttressed by proper science (natural or social), otherwise it will be crit- icized by those opposing or promoting this technology. It is a mammoth task, yes, but somebody has to start the ball rolling. It’s a challenge that we must embrace. [A. Mafa, pers. comm., 2010]
This book is a first step in this direction. In this complex and competitive setting, information is critical for multiple purposes. When writing a policy, drafting regulations, or making discrete decisions on GE crops, policymakers in SSA have to use selected information to advance their goals. Yet credible objective information on the impacts of GE crops and products based on their cost, risks, and benefits is not always easy to find and to digest, given the complexity of some of the issues at stake. Furthermore, even policy ana- lysts, researchers, and academics involved in agriculture policy may find it hard to find, access, and synthesize peer-reviewed studies on GE crops in the
African context. This is particularly true when gauging the economic effects of GE crops.
Why This Book?
Several countries in SSA have expressed concerns related to the farm-
level impacts, consumer concerns, trade impacts, and the biosafety and other regulatory issues related to GE crops and are considering inclusion of socio- economic assessments in their technology approval processes.3
For example, discussions during the approval process and subsequent adop- tion of GE crops in Burkina Faso and South Africa have generated significant internal controversies related to the potential socioeconomic, institutional, political, and environmental effects of technology adoption. Controversies and sometimes acrimonious discussions included socioeconomic concerns about the potential market effects of local adoption of Bt cotton, impacts on resource- poor farmers, farmers’ dependence on a continuous flow of innovations, as
well as external impacts that may affect local farmers (such as the potentially adverse reaction in some European markets). Other important concerns raised by opponents of the technology are the potential environmental and ecologi- cal implications of GM technologies, all of which bring additional uncertainty to the likelihood of farmer adoption. Examples of these discussions and debates include Pschorn-Strauss (2005) and Moola and Munnik (2007).
3 Example of countries considering such policies can be found in Mulenga and Shumba-Mnyulwa (2010) and Falck-Zepeda (2009).

20 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
These questions have also been raised in national and international forums in the context of biosafety regulatory and technology decisionmaking pro- cesses. African decisionmakers and all stakeholders involved in the process raise these questions, as they aim at identifying potential interventions to address specific productivity issues that impinge directly on farmer livelihoods.
A better understanding of the development, delivery, and downstream impact of GE crop innovations is required to comprehend their potential role in the African context. This will ensure that the right crops, traits, and deliv- ery methods are identified and used. Furthermore, understanding knowledge processes and the institutional framework in which GE crops may be deployed can help ensure maximization of the potential benefits while minimizing the risk to African farmers and communities.
The overall objective of this book is to contribute to reducing the knowl- edge gap about the potential role and impact of GE crops in SSA. The volume gathers a set of policy and economic studies recently completed on the current or potential effects of GE products in the countries of this region. Although the collection does not claim to be exhaustive in any way, it provides a discus- sion of relevant issues discussed in SSA and other policy forums, as well as some new and emerging themes. This book addresses some of the key policy questions in the debate on the role of GE crops in the region. The targeted audience includes policy analysts, policymakers, scientists, researchers, uni- versity students, and other stakeholders working on policy issues related to agricultural biotechnology in Africa and who are interested in an accessible volume on policy analysis.
The collection of studies is based on updated contributions that were ini- tially presented at a conference organized by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in Entebbe, Uganda, in May 2009. Chapters are organized thematically in three parts. Part I consists of three chapters on the economic effects of GE crops, with a focus on specific technologies. Part II presents two chapters on market acceptance, including one on consumer acceptance of GE food in Uganda and another discussing potential trade risk and regional integration. Part III focuses on research, regulatory, and tech- nology delivery issues. Although each chapter addresses one specific question, it also provides general lessons for policymakers. The book ends with a conclu- sion section that collects lessons and issues for policy and decisionmaking and identifies areas for future research.
Throughout the book, care has been taken to consider the distinct opin- ions and positions in the debate. IFPRI’s policy toward biotechnology is that even though some of these technologies are controversial and alone cannot

solve complex poverty and food insecurity issues, some of them have the potential to address specific issues related to hunger and malnutrition in devel- oping countries. Because of these considerations
IFPRI believes it would be irresponsible not to assess the potential
of genetically modified crops such as nutrient-enriched or drought- tolerant and disease-resistant crop varieties. At the same time, the Institute fully supports appropriate biosafety regulatory systems that are able to assess the risks. [IFPRI 2013]
We hope that this contribution will help inform the debates, in Africa and elsewhere, about the current and potential economic role of these crops in the agriculture of SSA. Furthermore, we expect that this book will help iden- tify current knowledge gaps and engage the innovation, product delivery, and downstream impacts related to GE crops in Africa in a more systematic man- ner, while at the same time providing relevant and timely information to the ongoing discussions related to the potential adoption and use of GE crops.

Chapter 1
Socioeconomic and Farm-Level Effects of Genetically Modified Crops: The Case of Bt Crops in South Africa
Marnus Gouse
The year 2011 was the 14th since the first commercial release of a genetically modified (GM) crop in South Africa. In 1997/98, insect- resistant (Bt) cotton was released for production, and South Africa became the first country in Africa where a GM crop was produced on a com- mercial level. Bt maize was approved for commercial production in 1998/99, and Bt yellow maize was planted in the same season. The first plantings of Bt white maize in 2001/02 established South Africa as the first GM subsis- tence crop producer in the world. Herbicide-tolerant (HT) cotton was made available for commercial production in the 2001/02 season along with HT soybeans. Commercialization of HT maize seeds followed in 2003/04. GM cotton containing the combined or “stacked” trait (Bt and HT) was released for the 2005/06 season, and Bt/HT maize was released for the 2007/08 pro- duction season.
This chapter supplies a brief summary of the performance, socioeconomic impacts, and main issues surrounding Bt cotton and GM maize in South Africa. A substantial number of peer reviewed papers on GM crops in South Africa have been published, and it is recommended that interested readers refer to these publications for more in-depth information and discussion on the studies and findings.
South African Biosafety Framework
In 1989 a US seed company approached the South African Department of Agriculture for permission to perform contained field trials with Bt cotton. This set in motion the South African biosafety regulatory process and ini- tiated the first trials with GM crops on the African continent. The South African Committee for Genetic Experimentation (SAGENE) had been formed in 1979 by public and private scientists to monitor and advise the National Department of Agriculture and industry on the responsible development of
 25

26 CHAPTER 1
genetically modified organisms (GMOs) through the provision of guidelines and the approval of research centers and projects. SAGENE gained statutory sta- tus in 1992 as the national advisory committee on modern GM biotechnology. The approval for the commercial release of Bt cotton and maize was done under the guidelines of SAGENE for the 1997/98 and 1998/99 seasons. These guide- lines and procedures remained the biosafety framework cornerstone until South Africa’s GMO Act 15 of 1997 was approved by Parliament in June 1997 and entered into force in November 1999, when the regulations were published. In 1999 SAGENE was replaced by the scientific Advisory Committee that was established under the GMO Act (Wolson and Gouse 2005). The South African GMO Act 15/1997, as amended in 2006, provides a comprehensive biosafety framework to manage research, development, application, production, and trade in GMOs. The GMO Secretariat is housed in the Department of Agriculture, and decisionmaking is vested in the GMO Executive Council that represents eight government departments. The Council is advised by a national Advisory Committee of scientific experts.
Since implementation, the GMO legislation has served the country well in its balanced approach to modern biotechnology and its applications. However, more recently there have been some unclear delays in the decisionmaking pro- cess, and the scientific community and academia have expressed concern that decisionmaking has become less scientific and a lack of transparency in the process could lead to an increase in the cost of regulation and in the opportu- nity cost for research institutions, innovators, and in reality, consumers.
Bt Cotton
In 2007 GM cotton globally covered 15 million hectares (43 percent of total world cotton), of which Bt varieties accounted for 10.8 million hectares
and a further 3.2 million hectares as Bt combined with a second Bt or with an herbicide-tolerance trait ( James 2007). In 2009 the global GM cotton area increased to 16.2 million hectares and in 2011 to 25 million or 68 percent
of global cotton plantings ( James 2009, 2011). Historically, cotton has been responsible for about 25 percent of global chemical insecticides used in agri- culture due to attacks by a range of insect pests (Woodburn 1995), with cot- ton bollworm being the main pest. In an effort to reduce insecticide use and with insect resistance build-up against chemicals, Bt technology has offered a cost-saving and environmentally friendlier alternative.
Cotton planting in South Africa declined from its peak of 180,000 hect- ares in 1988 (under tariff protection) to just over 5,000 hectares in 2010 due

SOCIOECONOMIC AND FARM-LEVEL EFFECTS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS 27
to a combination of market liberalization, low world cotton prices, and rela- tively better prices for competing crops like maize, sunflower seed, and sugar cane. South Africa has been a net importer of cotton for the past couple of decades. In 1997/98 South Africa became the first country in Africa to com- mercially produce GM crops with the release of Bt cotton. The initial uptake of the first Bt cotton varieties of the US cotton seed company, Delta and Pineland (D&amp;PL), was less than spectacular, as the conventional varieties of local ginning companies were more popular. Some commercial farmers were also cautious during the first seasons and wanted to test the new technology and see how ginners and the rest of the industry reacted. However, when the Bt gene was introduced into D&amp;PL’s popular OPAL variety (originally from Australia), adoption increased dramatically. NuOPAL (Bt), DeltaOPAL RR (HT), and NuOPAL RR (Stacked Bt/HT), which are currently planted in South Africa, are all based on the Delta OPAL germplasm (Gouse 2009).
As clearly shown in Table 1.1, Bt cotton has been very popular, reaching 70 percent of total cotton area in 2003. The share decreased somewhat
with the introduction of HT cotton, but Bt cotton remained the more popular of the two. With the introduction of stacked cotton (with both
the Bt and HT events), Bt’s share dropped considerably as farmers opted
for cotton with both traits. By the 2005/06 season 92 percent of the cotton plantings in South Africa were GM. A large share of the conventional cotton being planted is mandatory refugia that are planted alongside Bt fields to prevent insect-resistance development. Farmers tend to plant HT cotton as refugia for stacked Bt/HT plantings.
Despite various land reform and development projects attempting to set- tle small-scale farmers in established and potential cotton production areas, the traditional areas of Tonga (in Kangwane Mpumalanga) and Makhathini Flats (KwaZulu-Natal) remain the major contributors to smallholder cotton production. The total number of smallholder cotton producers has varied but generally amounts to a few thousand farmers with the vast majority of them situated on the Makhathini Flats. As large-scale farmers produce the bulk of the South African cotton crop, it would not be totally correct to suggest that the adoption figures in Table 1.1 apply to smallholders as well, though Bt cot- ton adoption by smallholders has not been less impressive. In the first com- mercialization season of 1997, only 4 farmers planted demonstration Bt plots under the guidance of Monsanto (the technology owner). In 1998, 75 farm- ers, or 3.4 percent of the cotton farmers on Makhathini, planted Bt cotton; in 1999, 411 farmers, or 13.7 percent, planted Bt. In 2000, 1,184 cotton farm- ers (39.5 percent) on the Makhathini Flats planted Bt cotton. In 2001 it was

Notes: Figures in previous publications have been updated with additional and revised figures. Official figures for the most recent years were not available at time of writing. Unofficial indications suggest that in 2012 nearly 100% of cotton produced in South Africa was GM, with stacked cotton making up the major share and farmers planting HT cotton as mandatory refugia.

estimated that close to 3,000 of the 3,229 farmers on the Flats planted Bt, reaching close to 90 percent adoption in five years (Gouse 2009).
This remarkable adoption rate was explained partly by the impressive performance of Bt cotton as planted by the first adopting Makhathini farm- ers. However, the other major explanation was that the sole credit and input supplier and cotton buyer on the Flats, Vunisa, also noticed the performance of Bt cotton and started to recommend the seed to its clients/farmers. As the main objective of a cotton gin is to gin as much cotton as possible, Vunisa wanted to increase the cotton crop on the Flats but not at the expense of their credit book. After monitoring the performance of Bt cotton for the first couple of seasons, Vunisa decided that it could increase the ginable cot- ton crop, and decrease the risk of crop failure (due to bollworm damage)
and thus their credit risk by recommending Bt cotton to farmers. It can
be argued that even though Vunisa was making inputs available to farm-
ers under credit long before Bt was introduced, the availability of credit and the role Vunisa’s extension officers had in recommending Bt seed played a large role in smallholders’ ability and decision to adopt the new technology (Gouse 2009).
All the peer reviewed publications on Bt cotton in South Africa (mainly focusing on smallholder farmers) report yield increases with the use of Bt cotton compared to conventional varieties (Table 1.2). Almost all studies also showed savings in insecticide expenditure; with the exception of results from the one-year, 20-farmer study by Hofs, Fok, and Vaissayre (2006). Even though most of the yield differences were substantial, some were found not to be statistically significant, mainly due to small sample sizes and large vari- ability in the data. Compared to study results in countries like Australia, China, India, and Mexico, the relative yield gain from the use of Bt cotton in South Africa is higher. One of the reasons for this is that the base yield (non- Bt cotton) of smallholders is very low, and a small change in yield is exag- gerated when expressed relative to a low conventional variety yield. In fact, in some other countries, the yield advantage of Bt cotton was more than the total seed cotton yield attained per hectare in South Africa (Fok et al. 2007). Gouse, Kirsten, and Jenkins (2003) found an 18.5 percent yield increase
for South African large-scale irrigation farmers for the 2000/2001 sea-
son, which compares well with a 16.8 percent increase measured on field trials at a Clark Cotton (a ginning company) experimental farm in Mpuma- langa. Large-scale dryland farmers enjoyed a 14 percent yield increase, while some studies found that small-scale dryland farmers enjoyed an increase of between 23 and 85 percent over a number of seasons (Table 1.2).

SOCIOECONOMIC AND FARM-LEVEL EFFECTS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS 31
These trends are consistent with findings elsewhere, such as in Argentina (Qaim, Cap, and De Janvry 2003), where large-scale commercial farmers were reported to enjoy 19 percent yield increases and smallholder farmers reported
41 percent yield increases. Like Qaim, Cap, and De Janvry (2003), South African researchers attribute the difference between the Bt yield advantages of small-
and large-scale farmers to the financial and human capital constraints that cause smallholders to invest in chemical pest control. Shankar and Thirtle (2005) showed that the average insecticide application level of smallholder farmers on the Makhathini Flats is lower than 50 percent of the optimal level; it is thus not surprising that Bt cotton is able to substantially reduce the yield loss caused by bollworms. With low control-group yields and limited (and in many cases in- effective) chemical insecticide applications, exaggerated yield increases in excess of 50, 60, and 80 percent as reported by Bennett, Morse, and Ismael (2006) do not seem so mind-boggling. But these results have to be seen in context, and as the authors caution, the figures might also be inflated due to selection bias.
The yield increase with Bt cotton, compared to conventional cotton, depends on the bollworm infestation level in the particular season and the effectiveness of chemical bollworm control by the farmer. It can be expected that the yield advantage will differ across farmers, farms, regions, and seasons (Fok et al. 2007). Both large-scale and smallholder farmers enjoyed significant savings on insecticides (generally 3/4/5 pyrethroid sprays), and despite higher expenditure on seed (as a result of the additional technology fee), they enjoyed a higher gross margin. However, it is important to stress that Bt does not kill all insects, and chemical spraying is still required to prevent damage by sucking insects, which in the past have been killed in the cross-fire aimed at bollworms.
The Bt technology fee was adjusted downward by about 24 percent
after the introduction season, following farmer concerns that the technol-
ogy was not affordable. The fee was then held constant at South African rand (ZAR) 600 per 25 kilograms of seed (between about $50 and $75 according
to the fluctuating local currency)1 for 1999/2000–2002/03, at ZAR700 for 2003/04–2004/05, and then at ZAR785 from 2005/06 to the 2008/09 season. Between 1999 and 2008 a 25 kilogram bag of conventional cotton sold for between ZAR150 and ZAR430. This means that the extra Bt technology fee per 25 kilogram bag was between 1.8 and 4.0 times the price of the bag of seeds (Gouse 2009).
Analysis of “who gains?” from Bt technology showed that despite the high technology fee, farmers captured the lion’s share of the additional benefits

generated by the introduction of this new technology (Gouse, Pray, and Schimmelpfennig 2004). Basing their calculations on the abovementioned studies, Brookes and Barfoot (2010) estimated that in the 11 years from 1998 to 2008, the use of Bt cotton contributed an additional $21 million to farm income in South Africa.
The Makhathini Flats smallholder experience with Bt cotton has been hailed internationally as the first example of how modern biotechnology can benefit resource-poor farmers in Africa. There can be no doubt that the major- ity of Makhathini Flats farmers did indeed benefit from the introduction of Bt cotton. They were able to adopt and benefit from this new technology because all the institutional structures that facilitate a functioning market were in place at the time. These structures include functioning input markets (credit, seeds, and chemicals) and output markets (seed cotton buyer) that operate at market clearing prices. An important factor was that Vunisa was the only buyer and, because of this monopsony power, could supply production credit to farmers who did not own their land, using the forthcoming crop as collateral (Gouse, Shankar, and Thirtle 2008). This system is not uncommon to Africa, where widespread failure of credit and input markets (partly due to lack of land ownership that could serve as collateral) has led to interlocked transactions, in which a firm wishing to purchase the farm output—typically a ginner in the case of cotton—provides inputs to farmers on credit and attempts to recover the credit upon purchase of the product (Tschirley, Poulton, and Boughton 2006). However, when the credit system collapsed in 2002—because of farm- ers defaulting on their loans as a consequence of a combination of droughts, low prices (linked to the low and stagnated world cotton price), marginal prof- its, adverse selection, and market competition—the whole system collapsed, and cotton production dropped.
The Makhathini smallholder experience is indeed a good example for the rest of Africa, as countries considering adoption of Bt cotton need to take note that although technical solutions can help address problems (such as lack of knowledge regarding insects and pest control, limited access to inputs, or evolution in pest pressure), no technology (GM or otherwise) can resolve the fundamental institutional challenges of smallholders and agri- culture in Africa. The particular case of the Makhathini Flats and the wider story of cotton in South Africa emphasize that although all agricultural systems require adequate investment and appropriate technologies, their viability is determined by the policies and institutions that facilitate sustain- able and profitable production. Bt cotton and more recently stacked (Bt/ HT) varieties are still the varieties of choice for smallholder producers, but

SOCIOECONOMIC AND FARM-LEVEL EFFECTS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS 33
production levels have decreased drastically and remain limited mainly due to the relatively low price of cotton.
Bt Maize
Globally, in 2007 GM maize was planted on 35 million hectares, or 24 percent of world maize plantings, of which 9.3 million hectares was Bt as single trait and another 18.8 million hectares in combination with other traits ( James 2007). In 2010 GM maize covered 46.8 million hectares globally, and the area increased to 51 million hectares in 2011 ( James 2010, 2011). Bt maize was first introduced in the United States in 1996, and by 2006 it covered 40 per- cent or 12.7 million hectares of the total US maize crop. In Argentina, varieties containing the Bt trait were planted on 73 percent of the total Argentinean maize area, and in Spain it covered 54,000 hectares or 15 percent of the total maize area (Brookes and Barfoot 2008).
Maize is the most important field crop in South Africa and annually cov- ers an estimated 30 percent of the total arable land. Maize serves as staple food for the majority of the South African population and also as the main feedgrain for livestock. Between 60 and 70 percent of the South African yel- low maize production is consumed in the chicken-production sector. Over the past 9–10 years, South Africa produced an average of 9.3 million metric tons of maize on 2.75 million hectares.
Even though Bt yellow maize was released in 1998 for commercial pro- duction, GM white maize was commercialized only in 2001. That year, South Africa became the first country in the world to permit the commercial produc- tion of a GM subsistence crop—Bt white maize. In South Africa and other southern African countries, the losses sustained in maize crops due to damage caused by the African maize stem (stalk) borer (Busseola fusca) are estimated to be between 5 and 75 percent, and it is generally accepted that, pre-Bt, Busseola annually reduced the South African maize crop by an average of 10 percent (Annecke and Moran 1982). Gouse et al. (2005) showed that in 2005 with
a seemingly conservative estimate of 10 percent for damage caused by both Busseola fusca and Chilo partellus, the average annual loss (in the absence of Bt) adds up to just under a million tons of maize, with an approximate value
of ZAR810 million. At the 2008 maize price level (more or less similar to the 2011 price level), the potential damage caused by borers would be closer to ZAR1.6 billion (about $200 million). Both B. fusca and C. partellus can be controlled to a satisfactory level with the use of the Bt gene currently used in South African Bt varieties (Cry1Ac).

34 CHAPTER 1
As can be seen in Table 1.3, the initial spread of Bt maize was quite slow because of the scale-up time required to have a sufficient amount of seeds
and to have the Bt trait inserted in hybrids that were suitably adapted to local conditions. Approval for commercial release of herbicide tolerance came in 2002 and the stacked traits of Bt and HT in 2007. Compared to cotton, the decrease in Bt and HT maize since the introduction of stacked maize was less pronounced. Bt remains the most popular trait, partly because especially white stacked maize adoption has been hindered by inadequate seed availability. In the 2008/09 production season, GM maize covered 70 percent of the total South African maize area, with Bt maize covering 43 percent. In 2009/10 the Bt maize area increased by a further 269,000 hectares up to 48 percent, mainly stemming from a drop in the white stacked maize area because of inadequate seed supply.
Considering the adoption rates illustrated in Table 1.3, it is possible to con- clude that South African maize farmers have benefited from the introduction of GM maize. Similar to the indicated GM cotton adoption rates in Table 1.1, these GM maize adoption rates represent adoption by predominantly com- mercial farmers. There are no official smallholder GM maize adoption figures, but it is estimated that about 10,500 subsistence, smallholder, and emergent farmers (about 23 percent of the smaller farmers), buying hybrid seed from the three major seed companies, planted GM maize in 2007 (Gouse, Kirsten, and Van der Walt 2008). However, there are still areas in South Africa where small- holders plant mainly open-pollinated varieties and traditional/saved seed, and definitions of subsistence, smallholder, smallholder projects, and emerging farmers also complicate estimations. It can therefore be argued that the num- ber of smallholders planting GM maize is still relatively minimal.
Marra, Pardey, and Alston (2002) found that there were significant ben- efits to planting Bt maize in the United States through increased yields, even when it appeared as if borer infestation levels were not large enough to con- trol with insecticides. Marra, Carlson, and Hubbell (1998) reported that the use of Bt maize boosted yields by 4–8 percent, depending on location and year. Results from outside the United States show a similar pattern. In the Huesca region in Spain, Brookes (2002) reported a yield increase of 10 percent over conventional maize protected with pesticides and an increase of 15 per- cent when insecticides were not used. Other regions in Spain enjoyed an aver- age Bt yield advantage of 6.3 percent, with a range of 2.9–12.9 percent. James (2002) reported a 8–10 percent yield increase in Argentina up to 2004, and more recent studies show a 5–6 percent increase (Brookes and Barfoot 2008). Gonzales (2002) recorded a yield advantage of 41 percent for Bt maize on

field trials in the Philippines, and Philippine farmers indicated an even higher (60 percent) yield improvement. In most countries, the additional cost of the Bt technology has exceeded the savings on insecticides and thus has resulted in an increase in total production costs.
Compared to the number of studies and publications on Bt cotton in South Africa, the body of literature and the number of researchers follow-
ing the farm-level impacts of Bt maize in South Africa is rather limited. Even though there have been reports in the media quoting some anecdotal find- ings of some fairly unscientific studies, only a series of studies by the University of Pretoria2 have endeavored to follow the socioeconomic effects and perfor- mance of Bt maize for a number of seasons, mainly focusing on smallholders.
Gouse et al. (2005) found average yield increases (due to better stem borer control) of 10–11 percent for commercial (dryland and irrigation) farmers, whereas smallholder Bt adopters reported yield increases of 0–32 percent for the seven seasons 2001/02–2007/08 (Gouse et al. 2010). A statistically insignificant average yield increase of 12 percent was found across the seven seasons. In sea- sons with a low stem borer infestation, resulting in insignificant stalk borer dam- age, farmers planting Bt maize seed were in all likelihood worse off than farmers planting conventional hybrid maize because of the extra Bt technology fee. It is however difficult to make preplanting predictions on seasonal stalk borer infes- tation levels due to the complicated relationship between rainfall, variable sea- sons, growth of maize, effect of stalk borer on the maize plant, and the effect of natural enemies on the host (Annecke and Moran 1982). Because a dry early sea- son does not necessarily portend a dry season throughout, South African large- scale commercial farmers indicate that Bt serves as affordable insurance against unforeseeable stalk borer outbreaks, but increases in seed cost or technology fees could easily outstrip that insurance value to small-scale and subsistence farmers in South Africa (Gouse et al. 2006).
Gouse et al. (2006) endeavored to quantify the 16 percent yield increase, the average of the Bt yield advantage for two groups of farmers in north-
ern KwaZulu-Natal for the 2002/03 season, in subsistence-farmer terms.
For these smallholders a 16 percent yield increase meant only 110 kilo- grams of extra grain, and selling the extra grain would render a rather insig- nificant income advantage. However, arguing that the extra grain replaces potentially purchased, relatively more expensive, maize meal (flour), the yield

advantage seems more valuable. Alternatively, using a generally excepted rule- of-thumb stating that a rural household of seven members requires fourteen 80 kilogram bags of maize meal for a year to be food secure, the 16 percent yield advantage in 2002/03 resulted in approximately 36 more days of maize meal for the household. This is assuming, rather unrealistically, that there is no postharvest damage to harvested grain.
Insecticide use by maize-producing smallholders is limited, and Bt adoption consequently did not result in substantial insecticide savings. Bt adoption by commercial farmers has resulted in decreased expenditure on insecticides but, similar to what has been reported in other countries, generally not enough to cover the increased seed cost. Depending on the quantity
of seed purchased, Bt maize seed was 23–25 percent more expensive than conventional seed, and more recently those percentages have increased to about 27–30 percent.
Following the planting of HT maize demonstration plots in 2003/04 and 2004/05 in some smallholder areas where Bt had been introduced, a number of farmers adopted HT maize in 2005/06. Many farmers who planted Bt maize in previous years instead opted for HT seed (Gouse et al. 2010). Farmers indicated that compared to stem borers, weeds are a constant pest, and it would seem as if the labor-saving benefit of HT maize is valued higher than the insect control (yield) benefit of Bt. With a substantial share of the economically active, able-bodied population emigrating to urban areas in search of employment and a tragically high HIV/AIDS prevalence, especially in rural KwaZulu-Natal, labor has become a scarce commodity for many South African smallholder farmers. By using broad-spectrum herbicides before and after planting (some only after), as opposed to manual weeding with hand and hoe, farmers are able to save quite considerably on family labor person-days. For some of the seasons, HT maize also yielded more grain than conventional hybrid maize with manual weeding because of more effective weed control.
In some areas in KwaZulu-Natal, HT has totally replaced Bt. In an attempt to benefit from both the GM technologies, some smallholders purchased stacked Bt/HT maize, but others indicated this maize is too expensive and opted for HT only (Gouse et al. 2010). Stem borer pressure has been low during the study seasons, and it would be interesting to see how HT-adopting farmers react to possible higher borer levels in seasons to come.
Using yield increase, insecticide savings, and increased seed expenditure indications of mainly Gouse et al. (2005), Brookes and Barfoot (2010) esti- mated that between 2000 and 2008, Bt maize adoption increased adopt- ing farmers’ farm income by a total of $476 million. That is a productivity

38 CHAPTER 1
increase–induced injection into the economy of ZAR3.67 billion over 9 years. To put this amount into context, over the past 10 years the South African Government has, through the platforms and initiatives created under the National Biotechnology Strategy (Republic of South Africa, Department of Science and Technology 2001), invested about ZAR900 million (Hanekom 2010) in biotechnology research and development.
Conclusion
Benefiting from a strong research background, South Africa was able to pro- actively develop guidelines and later legislation and regulations on the devel- opment and use of modern biotechnology and its applications such as GM crops. Development and implementation of a relatively dynamic GMO legisla- tion and underlying regulations have enabled South African farmers—and, to a lesser extent, consumers, through maize meal prices and health aspects (see Chapter 2)—to benefit from the first wave of GM crops.
Solely based on the high adoption levels of especially Bt cotton and maize by large-scale farmers, in the presence of available and less-expensive conven- tional seed varieties (including near isolines), it is possible to conclude that farmers benefited. Some peer-reviewed studies have shown that like large- scale farmers, smallholder cotton and maize farmers have also benefited, mainly through savings on insecticide applications and limitation of the dam- age caused by bollworms and stem borers.
Whereas Bt cotton saw a near 100 percent smallholder adoption rate in only a couple of years, adoption of Bt maize has been limited. There are a number
of reasons for this: in a vertically integrated production system where the input supplier also ensures an output market, adoption of a (early season) more expen- sive but productivity-increasing technology makes sense. However, smallholder maize farmers have to fund production inputs, and as many only produce on a subsistence level (in many cases surplus production depends on the season’s rain- fall), farmers are unable to directly recover their input expenditures. Contrary to cotton, for which bollworm pressure and damage seems to be more constant and severe, stem borer infestation levels (especially on dryland maize) vary signifi- cantly from season to season and across areas, and the damage level is generally lower than with cotton. Though very few smallholder maize farmers apply an insecticide to control stem borers on maize, the amount of labor and chemicals required to control borers is far less than what is required to control bollworms on cotton. Another factor that is sometimes not taken into consideration, espe- cially in the South African context, is that smallholder maize farmers’ reasons

SOCIOECONOMIC AND FARM-LEVEL EFFECTS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS 39
or motivation for maize production differ. In the production of a cash crop like cotton, farmers are profit driven and are intent on producing as much as possi- ble. On the contrary, some smallholder maize farmers are only interested in pro- ducing enough for their households, others only plant a couple of lines for fresh maize, and yet others only produce to sell. It is unlikely that the smaller produc- ers would invest in a productivity-increasing technology like Bt maize.
That a technology was introduced and adopted and that farmers benefited does not necessarily result in a flourishing sector, as is evident from the exam- ple of South African cotton. Even with biotechnology, South African cot-
ton farmers were not able to produce profitably at low cotton world prices. The fact that many smallholders continued producing, while commercial farmers left the sector for greener or more profitable pastures is indicative of smallholders’ dependence on government support and limited alternative pro- duction options and not of the success of biotechnology.
Bt seed technology is a production tool just like fertilizers, herbicides, or irrigation technologies. Contrary to the technologies of the Green Revolution, it might be able to improve the yields of farmers with limited ability or means to control insects. However, it will by no means be able to overcome institu- tional failure and governance challenges that seem to be endemic in African agriculture and that were also the limiting factors in the Green Revolution. The experience with Bt cotton on the Makhathini Flats emphasizes that technology-induced advances might be short lived in the absence of the cor- rect institutional structures, regulations, cooperation, and competition.

Bt Maize and Fumonisin Reduction in South Africa: Potential Health Impacts
Carl E. Pray, John P. Rheeder, Marnus Gouse, Yvette Volkwyn, Liana van der Westhuizen, and Gordon S. Shephard
Starting in the late 1940s, deaths from esophageal cancer (EC) rose dramatically in rural areas of the Transkei region of South Africa, which is part of the Eastern Cape Province (Rose and Fellingham
1981). And from the early to mid-1900s, maize was widely adopted, replac- ing sorghum (McCann 2005). From 1996 to 2000, regional EC incidence occurred at an age-standardized rate of 31.2/100,000 for males and 21.8/100,000 females—far higher than next-highest regional cancer inci- dences at the same time, which were lung cancer in men (6.2/100,000) and cervical cancer in women (19.0/100,000). In South Africa as a whole, the EC rate is 14.3/100,000. Globally, the EC rate is about 4/100,000 for women and 9/100,000 for men. Other hot spots for EC are found in China, Iran, and Zimbabwe (Somdyala et al. 2003).
In response to these developments, the government of South Africa estab- lished the first Transkei Oesophagus Cancer Study Group in 1975 to investi- gate this problem. This Study Group evolved into what is now the Programme on Mycotoxins and Experimental Carcinogenesis (PROMEC) at the Medical Research Council. Through extensive studies, scientists have established a sig- nificant correlation between EC and high levels of fumonisin, a mycotoxin produced by a maize fungus (Rheeder et al. 1992).
Evidence suggests that fumonisin exposure causes neural tube defects (NTDs) in human babies by disrupting the uptake of folate in cell lines (Marasas et al. 2004; Missmer et al. 2006). High levels of NTDs were found in a rural district of the Eastern Cape Province (610/100,000) and in rural areas of Limpopo Province (350/100,000), in contrast to about 10/100,000 in urban centers of South Africa (Marasas et al. 2004). High levels of NTDs are also found in those areas of China with high EC and high fumonisin levels. Animal models also link fumonisin with NTDs, but administration of folate partially reduced the mycotoxin’s impact (Gelineau–van Waes et al. 2005).

44 CHAPTER 2
PROMEC has developed and tested a number of strategies to reduce con- sumers’ exposure to mycotoxins. These include food-preparation methods
to reduce the mycotoxin (Van der Westhuizen et al. 2010), regulatory stan- dards for maximum allowable exposure (Rheeder et al. 2009), measures for early detection of tumors (Venter 1995), and maize variety selection and breeding programs to develop cultivars with improved host resistance against Fusarium ear rot (Rheeder et al. 1990; Rheeder, Marasas, and Van Schalkwyk 1993). This last intervention seemed particularly promising, because such cultivars could be used in rural areas not closely linked to markets or govern- ment services.
Transgenic insect-resistant (Bt) maize has emerged as a potential way of reducing fumonisin exposure. Past conventional plant breeding in South Africa has done little to reduce susceptibility of maize to Fusarium, the fun- gus that produces fumonisin. Bt maize contains a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis that encodes for formation of a crystal protein toxic to common lepidopteran maize pests, which includes the maize stalk borer. Insect damage predisposes maize to mycotoxin contamination, because insects cre- ate kernel wounds that encourage fungal colonization, and insects themselves may serve as vectors of fungal spores (Sinha 1994; Wicklow 1994; Munkvold, Hellmich, and Rice 1999). Thus, methods that reduce insect damage in maize can also reduce risks of fungal contamination (Wu 2006).
This study examines the extent to which Bt hybrids could reduce myco- toxins at the village level. Although some studies have examined the impact
of Bt hybrids on fumonisins on experiment stations both outside and inside South Africa (for example, Munkvold, Hellmich, and Rice 1999; De la Campa et al. 2005; Rheeder et al. 2005), no studies have focused on small farmers’ fields. The plan of this study was to sample ears of Bt maize and conventional maize after harvest to measure fungus and mycotoxin levels found on these ears in the regions of the Eastern Cape, where major health problems due to mycotoxins are found, as well as in KwaZulu-Natal, where we were already sur- veying small farmers about their use of transgenic maize. Unfortunately, in one target region for the study in the Eastern Cape, Bt seed did not arrive in time for planting. In the other Eastern Cape location, the weather was so dry that virtually no maize was planted for several consecutive years. Hence, village- level results reported below are from KwaZulu-Natal alone.
A secondary study objective is to examine whether adoption of Bt maize seed in rural areas could reduce rural consumers’ exposure to mycotoxins to levels considered safe by the international health community.

BT MAIZE AND FUMONISIN REDUCTION IN SOUTH AFRICA 45
Background
Fumonisins are produced primarily by the fungi Fusarium verticillioides
and F. proliferatum.1 The former is an almost universal inhabitant of maize (Haliburton and Buck 1986). Fumonisins are a recently discovered class of mycotoxins produced by the fungi F. verticillioides (formerly F. moniliforme), F. proliferatum, and some related species (Rheeder, Marasas, and Vismer 2002). The disease in maize caused by these fungi is called Fusarium kernel rot. The first report implicating fumonisins in human disease was connected with high human EC rates in Transkei, South Africa, in 1992 (Rheeder et al. 1992). The following year, interest in these mycotoxins increased after unusu- ally high horse and swine death rates in the United States were linked to con- taminated feed (Marasas 1996).
Fumonisin causes toxic effects through its inhibition of ceramide synthase, an enzyme necessary for sphingolipid metabolism (Van der Westhuizen et al. 2008). It is positively associated with EC (Rheeder et al. 1992). Scientists have found similar patterns of high fumonisin concentrations in maize and high- incidence areas of EC in China (Chu and Li 1994). Additional risk factors associated with the development of EC are smoking and alcohol consumption. PROMEC’s hypothesis is that in South Africa the increase in EC is due in part to a major shift in cropping patterns from sorghum to maize in these areas and the associated rise in consumer exposure to fumonisins, which are particularly prevalent in maize.
Elevated levels of fumonisin in animal feed cause such diseases as equine leukoencephalomalacia (a disease of the central nervous system) and porcine pulmonary edema, heart failure, and liver damage in swine (Marasas et al. 1988; Kellerman et al. 1990; Ross et al. 1992; Wilson et al. 1992; US Food and Drug Administration 2001). Horses have been shown to exhibit neuro- logical symptoms suggestive of antemortem toxicity after feeding on grain containing 10.56 milligrams/kilogram total fumonisins for 92–122 days, and swine have exhibited liver injury at 23 milligrams/kilogram total fumonisins for 14 days (US Food and Drug Administration 2001). Fumonisin has
been shown to cause liver and kidney cancer in rats and liver cancer in mice (Gelderblom et al. 1991; Howard et al. 2001), as well as alterations in kidney function (Bondy et al. 1995; Voss et al. 1995).

evaluated fumonisins and allocated a group provisional maximum tolerable daily intake of 2 micrograms/kilogram body weight/day for FB1, FB2, and FB3, alone or in combination (Bolger et al. 2001). The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified FB1 as a Group 2B carcinogen, that is, possi- bly carcinogenic to humans (IARC 2002).
Maize flour is the basic starch in South Africa and makes up a large part
of all food consumed by people with limited resources. PROMEC’s recent survey of consumption patterns in Bizana and Centane in the Eastern Cape Province (Table 2.1) found that adults consumed from 335 to 483 grams of maize/person/day, or between 133 and 176 kilograms per year. In addition, the average consumer drank 32 milliliters/day of beer, and the average self- reported drinker had 1,048 milliliters/day. Beer is primarily made from moldy maize in Bizana and Centane, and hence has high fumonisin levels (Shephard et al. 2005).
The amount of fumonisin in the grain or beer in these regions is very high (Table 2.2). Fumonisin contamination levels are similar for grain

from large commercial farmers and good-quality grain of smallholder semi- subsistence farmers in low-EC areas (first and second rows in Table 2.2). However, fumonisin is much higher in grain milled in local mills than it is in maize meal or grits milled in commercial mills (rows labeled maize-based food in Table 2.2). Fumonisins are much lower in flour from commercial mills, because the commercial milling process removes the grain’s outer shell contain- ing most of the fumonisins.
The last two columns in Table 2.1 show how much fumonisins rural con- sumers eat. The penultimate column assumes that fumonisin levels are those for home-grown maize in the two regions and that all maize eaten is home grown. In recent years, these assumptions are clearly incorrect, as drought

48 CHAPTER 2
conditions and other factors in some regions have severely limited local maize production in Centane. Whatever consumers are eating is from local stores and is not home grown. If we assume that the fumonisin level in flour is about 200 micrograms/kilogram, which is the level found in commercially milled maize flour, then the amounts consumed would be those shown in the last col- umn of Table 2.1.
Using the levels of fumonisin concentration from maize produced and con- sumed in villages, the average exposure in all groups is far above the 2 micro- grams/kilogram body weight/day that JECFA recommends as the safe upper limit of daily consumption. If all maize flour comes from commercial mills, the mean consumption by children is still 50 percent higher than the JECFA limit. Most other groups (last column in Table 2.1) consume fumonisin at about the JECFA limit, which implies that about half of consumers still take in more than the recommended amount. In South Africa, the Health Department, Medical Research Council, and other experts think that an upper limit of
1 microgram/kilogram body weight/day is a safer level under South African conditions. Most people in these areas consume more than this more restric- tive limit.
PROMEC and other organizations have attempted a number of technology and policy interventions over the years. Table 2.3 lists these interventions and indicates whether they were targeted at EC, NTDs, or other animal health prob- lems. Starting in late 1982, PROMEC has also operated a program to identify and encourage commercialization of fumonisin-resistant maize. If the trait could be worked into local farmers’ open pollinated varieties through government or public–private partnerships, farmers would not have to buy the seed every year, and expensive government seed supply systems would not be required.
The PROMEC program tested selected commercial hybrids starting in the late 1980s, growing them in Transkei in trials against the landraces (Rheeder 1995). Some showed some resistance, but they were not adapted to conditions in Transkei. As a result, they could not be adopted directly. Some improved lines were identified and turned over to the Agricultural Research Council (ARC). ARC did use these lines in breeding programs for a while but did not produce anything specifically for fumonisin resistance. One problem was that even if you could select cultivars that reduced the visible fungus, you did not necessarily reduce the fumonisin, because sometimes the fungus is not visible on the kernels (known as asymptomatic infection).
When transgenic plants became a possibility, PROMEC contacted private firms such as Pioneer Hi Bred in the United States, which had a research pro- gram to introduce genes to disrupt the fumonisin genes in the kernel that were

   responsible for producing the fumonisin. PROMEC then saw in the literature that Bt maize, developed to reduce losses from insect pests, also had signifi- cantly lower levels of fumonisin (Munkvold, Hellmich, and Rice 1999; Dowd 2001; Bakan et al. 2002; Hammond et al. 2003). When Monsanto introduced the Bt gene in South Africa, PROMEC initiated efforts to collaborate with the company to determine whether this technology could reduce mycotoxins in rural villages. The first test compared Bt hybrids with their isolines on ARC experiment stations, where conditions could be controlled. These were first run in 2001/02, with a second round in 2002/03. Results were mixed. In some years in some locations Bt maize had much lower levels of fumonisins than did conventional maize, but in other years or locations little difference was dis- cernable. However, on average Bt maize had 60 percent less fumonisin than conventional hybrids (Rheeder et al. 2005).
The government intervention, which this chapter examines, is the intro- duction and distribution of Bt maize seed to subsistence farmers. The

hypothesis is that Bt maize would control stalk borers, thus reducing fungus levels and concomitantly reducing levels of fumonisin in home-grown maize. Hybrid Bt maize seeds have spread widely in South Africa in recent years but are mainly used by commercial farmers rather than subsistence farmers in the Eastern Cape (see Chapter 1 for a discussion of the spread of GM maize in South Africa).
The introduction of Bt maize to small farms in the Eastern Cape is unlikely to take place without some government assistance, because seed companies would not find it profitable to serve smallholder farmers in these areas. The farmers are poor, do not buy seeds annually (see Table 2.4), and rarely use com- plementary inputs like fertilizer on their soil. Thus, either government exten- sion services must develop Bt hybrids for the region and provide these seeds
to farmers, or the government should subsidize private companies to provide these seeds.
Methods and Results of the Rockefeller Study
Maize samples were collected from farmers in three locations in the province of KwaZulu-Natal after harvest. Samples were taken in areas where we were also surveying the economic impact of Bt maize on farmers’ incomes. We con- tacted farmers in our sample who we knew were using Bt maize. In some cases when our contact farmers had already consumed or sold their Bt maize, we contacted their neighbors. Farmers identified the grain as Bt hybrids, non-
Bt hybrids, or local varieties. The number of samples varied between 50 and 80 maize samples each year.
The mycological analysis was conducted as follows. Briefly, subsamples
of kernels (80–100 grams) were surface sterilized for 1 minute in 3.5 per- cent commercial sodium hypochlorite solution and rinsed twice in sterile dis- tilled water. One hundred kernels (5 kernels/90 millimeter petri dish) were then transferred to malt extract agar (1.5 percent) containing novobiocin (150 milligrams/liter), and the agar plates were incubated at 25°C in the dark

for 5–7 days. All isolated fungi were recorded and identified according to their morphological characteristics on the agar plates.
Fumonisin level was determined as follows. Each sample was ground in
a laboratory mill to a fine meal and extracted with methanol:water (3:1) by homogenization. An aliquot was applied to a strong anion exchange solid- phase extraction cartridge, and the fumonisins were eluted with 1 percent acetic acid in methanol. The purified extracts were evaporated to dryness, redissolved in methanol, and derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde. The deriv- atized extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a Phenomenex Luna 5: C18(2) column and fluores- cence detection.
Statistical analysis was done on the mycology and fumonisin data using SPSS 13 software (Chicago, United States) to determine any significant differ- ences between the groups (that is, traditional, commercial, and Bt maize) of samples at the three locations. Analyses were conducted on the F. verticillioides + F. proliferatum (FvFp) and total fumonisin variables only, with natural log transformation of the latter variable.
The results of the village surveys (Table 2.5) show a clear advantage of Bt maize over conventional hybrids and traditional maize seed. Bt maize had 40 percent less fumonisin than did traditional cultivars. Relative to the non-Bt commercial maize hybrid, Bt maize had on average 16 percent less fumonisin.
The table also shows variability of fumonisin levels in different years and different locations. These differences may result from weather, other environ- mental factors, or hybrid characteristics. A recent study (De la Campa et al. 2005) of fumonisin in maize in fields managed by scientists rather than farm- ers in Argentina and the Philippines found that although the use of Bt maize explains much of the variation in fumonisin levels, location or weather explain more of the variation. In addition, levels of insect damage and use of different hybrids also explain the variation. Our data show similar results: on average Bt maize has less fumonisin, but levels vary because of weather and other factors. As noted in Table 2.5, in the first year in Hlabisa Bt hybrids had traits that attracted birds to eat kernels, which allowed the fungus that causes fumonisin to multiply rapidly and led to high levels of fumonisin.
These results can also be compared to those from South African experi- ment station studies conducted by PROMEC on ARC research stations Potchefstroom and Vaalharts in 2002 and 2003. These experiment stations are in the heart of the commercial maize-growing area of South Africa. These experiments compared commercial Bt hybrids with their isolines (identical

bCommercial maize includes nontransgenic and transgenic hybrids but without Bt genes.
cHigh levels of fumonisin are a result of untimely late rains just before harvest linked with maize ear morphology of the Bt
hybrid (which has since been removed from commercial production), which resulted in attacks by birds and fungal damage to the ears.

hybrids except for the addition of Bt). As in the village studies, there was con- siderable diversity in results among different hybrids, different locations, and different years. The authors of this study (Rheeder et al. 2005, S88) con- cluded that “the incidence of fumonisin-producing Fusarium species, stalk borers (B. fusca), and levels of fumonisin, were generally lower in the Bt hybrids.” The fumonisin levels in the Bt hybrids were on average 51 percent lower than the non-Bt isoline at Potchefstroom in 2002, 83 percent lower at Potchefstroom in 2003, and 39 percent lower in Vaalharts in 2003.
Implications—How Much Could This Technology Reduce Mycotoxin Exposure?
If all farmers in the Eastern Cape shifted to Bt maize and obtained the same results as farmers in our sample in KwaZulu-Natal, would it reduce their intake of fumonisin to safe levels? To test this possibility, we simulated the

impact of reducing fumonisin levels by 62 percent using the data introduced in Table 2.1.
If Bt maize could be introduced into this area and adopted by 100 per- cent of farmers and if the reduction in fumonisin exposure due to Bt were the same as that found in the maize from KwaZulu-Natal villages (column 4 of Table 2.5), then there would be a dramatic reduction in fumonisin exposure (see Table 2.6). In Bizana, most groups of people except children would have lower exposure than the suggested maximum level of 2 micrograms/kilogram body weight/day. In Centane, however, all groups would still remain above the suggested level.
In fact, the combination of the declining production of maize in the area (which has forced families to eat more commercially milled maize) and a switch to Bt maize by those who continue to grow maize could reduce expo- sure dramatically. The only obvious way to reduce consumption to the level of 2 micrograms/kilogram body weight/day is by stopping consumption
of home-grown maize (see last column of Table 2.1) or through farmers’ adop- tion of a cultivar that completely disrupts the production of fumonisin in maize. Cultivars of this type are being developed in research programs at the

Other village-level options that PROMEC has explored include improved sorting and washing of maize kernels to remove fumonisin (Van der West- huizen et al. 2010), or new cooking techniques to reduce the consumption
of fumonisin. Washing grain for 10 minutes and grading it appear to be par- ticularly promising, reducing fumonisin in cooked food by 65 percent (Van der Westhuizen et al. 2010). The challenge with this option is getting the word out to resource-poor households and encouraging them to use this sim- ple food-preparation procedure.
Another possible intervention would be to supply more commercial grain, with lower fumonisin levels, to farmers through health and welfare programs. As Table 2.2 shows, shifting from local grain to commercially milled grain would substantially reduce exposure, but there could be a loss of consumer benefits if commercially milled grain is more expensive and consumers prefer the taste of their own grain.
Stricter regulations to ban the sale of grain with more than 1 ppm fumoni- sin might have an impact on urban consumers who buy maize in markets
but would not affect rural consumers who do not buy maize meal. To pre- vent NTDs, the government is requiring that all grain be fortified with folate. However, subsistence farmers cannot easily access folate supplements, and their diets do not naturally contain high folate levels. Finally, brush biopsies can be used for early detection of EC (Venter 1995). If detected early enough, tumor removal is usually a successful operation, but this is clearly the interven- tion of last resort.
Conclusions and Future Research
This study provides evidence that the adoption of Bt maize can reduce expo- sure of subsistence farmers in South Africa to the mycotoxin fumonisin. The spread of Bt maize could ameliorate but not solve the problem of fumonisin in human and animal diets. However, getting Bt maize seed to small farmers in the Eastern Cape would be a major undertaking. Farmers are not using hybrids in these areas. They are instead using relatively well-adapted open pollinated varieties, and they save their own seed. Even with the good will of a major seed company, we were not able to get seed of existing Bt hybrids out to farmers so that they could test it. To establish widespread acceptance of Bt cultivars, some organization would have to either breed open pollinated varieties that are well adapted to this area or provide well-adapted hybrids every year or two. ARC

BT MAIZE AND FUMONISIN REDUCTION IN SOUTH AFRICA 55
has participatory breeding programs in some areas of South Africa that could be used for this purpose, but so far ARC is not doing participatory breeding for reduced fumonisin or using Bt lines. The extension system is very limited in what it can do. Farmers in some of these areas have almost given up plant- ing maize.
Changes in eating habits to use more commercial maize meal and the increasing use of rice and vegetables have already helped reduce fumonisin exposure. These changes seem to be due to a combination of higher welfare payments (which may have allowed some families to buy more grain) and also to poor rainfall (which has led to lower production of maize). None of these were policies to improve diets and when taken in combination with urban- ization (which has increased the availability and status of “fast foods”), the diets of the poor may well have reduced fumonisin levels but at the same time become considerably less healthy.
Currently, the government of South Africa and the provincial governments clearly have their hands full with HIV/AIDS. However, if the government does decide to attack EC, a thorough evaluation of the efficacy of the various options available to reduce exposure to fumonisin is needed, and then a serious study of the costs of the different types of interventions must be conducted.

Genetically Modified Cotton in Uganda: An Ex Ante Evaluation
Daniela Horna, Patricia Zambrano, José Falck-Zepeda, Theresa Sengooba, and Miriam Kyotalimye
The Ugandan government has recognized the need to increase the per- formance of cotton and the potential of crop biotechnologies, particu- larly the role of genetically modified (GM) varieties to improve cotton production and thus the economy in general. In 2008, the National Biosafety Committee of Uganda approved the guidelines for implementing con-
fined trials, which enabled testing the environmental safety and performance of insect-resistant (Bt) and herbicide-tolerant (HT) cotton varieties. The implementation of the confined trials started in May 2009.
The release into the environment and eventual commercialization of GM cotton seed may raise questions about the socioeconomic impact of this tech- nology for Ugandan farmers. The economic impact of GM technologies can be assessed at different levels. The objective of this study is to provide an ex ante evaluation of the potential impact of GM cotton adoption in Uganda
at the farm level.1 To understand the context of this evaluation, we briefly review the literature available on ex ante evaluations of GM crops in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA). Next we describe the cotton value chain in Uganda and explain the main production systems. In the third section, we present the methodological approach used in the study to compare the profitability of the different cotton production alternatives. Finally, we present our main findings, conclusions, and policy recommendations and examine further considerations for evaluating the potential impact of GM cotton in Uganda.
1 This study was part of a multilevel evaluation carried out in 2007 with the support of the Program for Biosafety Systems. A full report of the project findings can be found in the forthcoming IFPRI book Socioeconomic Considerations in Biosafety Decisionmaking: Methods and Implementation.

62 CHAPTER 3
Ex Ante Impact of GM Crops in SSA
The adoption of GM varieties worldwide has expanded considerably since they were first commercialized in 1996. Originally only four countries approved the adoption and use of transgenic crops covering an area of just above 11 million hectares. In the case of cotton, GM varieties have been com- mercialized in 10 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Mexico, South Africa, the United States, and most recently, Burkina Faso. In parallel, the areas of non-GM conventional cotton have been decreas- ing in favor of Bt and HT cotton. James (2011) estimates that in 2011, more than 68 percent of world cotton was planted to GM varieties, including
both open-pollinated varieties and hybrids.
In 2009 the International Food Policy Research Institute published a
review of the economic impact of these crops in developing economies and the methods used to evaluate this impact (Smale et al. 2009). The review revealed that very few studies have addressed the potential or actual impact of GM crops on smallholders in SSA. Aside from numerous publications of the actual impact of Bt cotton and Bt maize in South Africa, the number of ex ante eval- uations is still limited in Africa. In East Africa De Groote et al. (2003) evalu- ated the potential for Bt maize; Edmeades and Smale (2006) discussed the potential impact of a GM banana on smallholder farmers in the Uganda high- lands. In West Africa, Horna et al. (2008) assessed ex ante GM vegetables in Ghana. More recently Vitale at al. (2008, 2010) have documented the impact of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso.
Given the importance of cotton in SSA and the availability of the technology, most of the ex ante evaluations have concentrated on GM cotton, especially Bt cotton. In West Africa for instance, Cabanilla, Abdoulaye, and Sanders (2005) developed a linear-programming model
to assess the potential cost to West Africa, Mali in particular, of not adopting Bt cotton. Elbehri and MacDonald (2004) and Langyintuo
and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2006) have carried out evaluations mainly based on trade models. Most recently, a study by Falck-Zepeda, Horna, and Smale (2008) examined the potential of Bt cotton for the West Africa region with emphasis on Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, and Togo using an eco- nomic surplus approach.
These studies conclude that there would be significant losses in economic benefits if Bt cotton is not adopted. Several of these studies also point to important institutional issues as significant determinants of the level and social distribution of benefits. A key institutional issue seems to be the decision

about the technology development, whether it will be imported, adapted, or generally adopted (Cabanilla, Abdoulaye, and Sanders 2005; Falck-Zepeda, Horna, and Smale 2008). The technology fee (price charged to farmers) is also a cross-cutting issue that will determine the potential benefits of GM technol- ogies in developing economies (Smale et al. 2009). Another critical issue is the ability of the innovator or the technology-transfer agent to transmit to farm- ers the necessary knowledge to manage the technology under field conditions. As concluded by Falck-Zepeda et al. (2008), GM technologies need to be part of a broad, integrated pest-management—or better yet, an integrated crop- management—strategy for implementation in SSA.
The Ugandan Cotton Sector
The history of cotton in Uganda is well documented in the literature (You and Chamberlin 2004; Cotton Development Organisation 2006; Baffes 2009; Tschirley, Poulton, and Labaste 2009). The long tradition of cotton cultivation gives the crop a historic significance. Cotton was introduced
to the central region of Uganda in about 1903, and over the years it has spread to the rest of the country. In the 1950s cotton and coffee became— and up to 1970 they remained—the most important sources of revenue for the government.
Several studies have noted that cotton has the potential to improve the welfare of about 250,000 low-income farming households (Gordon and Goodland 2000; Baffes 2009). At the aggregate national level, however, cot- ton constitutes just 2.2 percent of all crop production and thus plays a rela- tively small part in rural livelihoods (You and Chamberlin 2004). From a trade point of view, cotton ranks third among agricultural commodities exported, although it only accounts for 2–5 percent of Ugandan total exports (Serunjogi et al. 2001). In 2007 cotton exports were valued at 36 million US dollars with Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and the United Kingdom gen- erating more than 80 percent of these revenues (ICAC 2008; FAO 2010). All organic cotton is exported to the EU, mainly Switzerland. The local indus-
try consumes approximately 7–10 percent of the lint produced (ACE 2006; Uganda 2007).
Cotton is widely cultivated in more than 30 districts across the country (see Figure 3.1) because of the favorable agroclimatic conditions (You and Chamberlin 2004). The most important producing areas are located in the northern and western regions of Uganda.

Seed Value Chain
The cotton value chain depends on the availability and the quality of seeds. Ugandan production is characterized by the use of only one seed variety avail- able for both conventional and organic planting, the Bukalasa Pedigree Albar. The one-seed policy has been promoted as a way to guarantee quality homog- enization. From the postharvest and marketing perspective, this is an advan- tage, because a single variety ensures uniformity in the production of lint and yarn. The dependence on a single variety, however, increases the vulnerability to pests and diseases and represents a potential risk.
The main actors in the cotton seed chain in Uganda are the cotton pro- ducers, the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) of Uganda, the Cotton Development Organisation (CDO), and some private ginneries. NARO2 coordinates and oversees all aspects of agricultural research in Uganda; it is in charge of cotton research breeding and technology development. According to ACE (2006), its breeding work had led to increased yields (from 740–1,230 kilograms/hectare to 3,700–5,000 kilograms/hectare currently) and enhanced ginning turnout (from 33 percent up to 37 percent in areas of high fertility).
However, the multiplication and seed-distribution process needs more atten- tion. The basic cotton seed is developed by NARO but multiplied by CDO and mainly distributed to the ginneries for commercial multiplication and distribu- tion to farmers. The seed that farmers use is entirely channeled through the gin- neries, NARO, and CDO. The CDO3 regulates, coordinates, and promotes
all aspects of the cotton subsector in Uganda. CDO also monitors cotton pro- duction and marketing and provides policy advice regarding the crop (Cotton Development Organisation 2006). CDO is therefore responsible for delinting, grading, and dressing all seed that will be given to ginneries for distribution. The seed is distributed free of charge to farmers.4
Availability of cotton seed is a limiting constraint for improving cotton productivity in Uganda. The need for improved varieties and certified seed is probably the most important constraint encountered in cotton produc- tion (Serunjogi et al. 2001). According to the Uganda Export Promotion Board (UEPB 2007), cotton exports in 2006 fell 29 percent compared to the

previous year. Among other factors, the low performance in 2006 was related to late planting, but mainly to the use of ungraded fuzzy (not delineated) seed, leading to high seed wastage and increased cost of provision of planting seed.
Given the existing limitations in the seed value chain, the introduction of GM seed in this system needs to be carefully thought out. First, the one-variety policy would probably need to be changed. The possibility exists that the devel- opers may not introduce the GM trait into the local variety, as it may not be part of their marketing and product diffusion strategy. Alternatively, developers may have improved varieties suited to the area. The participation of the public and private sectors in seed multiplication and distribution has to be discussed up- front. Would the technology developer be in charge of seed distribution? Is the government interested in negotiating a good price for cotton producers?
The technology fee is another critical aspect that needs to be carefully discussed. The development of GM seed for Uganda represents a signifi- cant investment that must be paid for. It is quite likely that GM seed will not be delivered free of charge, as has been the case in most adopting countries. It is possible that the government of Uganda would assume part of the cost, but it can also be expected that farmers will need to pay for the technology. For resource-poor farmers the big incentive to adopt a technology is often a guaranteed profit, especially for a cash crop like cotton.
Product Value Chain
Farmers, intermediate agents, and ginners/exporters are the main actors in the product value chain. As mentioned above, farmers obtain the seed from the ginners. Ginners traditionally provide farmers with fertilizers and pesticides. Farmers pay back at harvest with either cotton or cash. The level of inputs used is still limited, however, and often farmers decide to plant cotton only because of the secure market and fixed price. In the northern part of the country there are few alternatives to cotton, either as a single crop or as part of a rotation.
At harvest, farmers can take their production to the ginneries, but often the volume produced is so small it does not justify paying for transport. Most com- monly, intermediary agents gather the production of several farmers and take
it to the ginneries. Intermediary agents can either work for the ginnery or be independent. There are more than 50 ginneries distributed all over the coun- try. Thirty-one different companies privately own the ginneries. Given the irreg- ular cotton production, ginneries compete for access to cotton areas, as most ginneries operate below their potential capacity, although the operating gin- ning machines are of poor quality. In most cases, ginneries are active only during the harvest period. Although cotton production in Uganda does not cover the

ginning potential and most companies work with excess capacity, most machines are rather old, and the quality of the turnout is low. An increase in overall cot- ton production can favor individual actors (producers, ginners, and government) and thus the economy in general. If the introduction of GM cotton boosted cot- ton yields, as expected, ginnery operations would therefore increase.
The challenging part from the standpoint of marketing channels will be devising ways to keep GM cotton from mixing with conventional varieties, or even worse, with organic cotton. However, in Uganda organic lint is already separated from conventional lint by using different ginneries for the two types. After separation of cotton seed from cotton lint, organic and conventional seeds are pooled together. The recycled seeds go back to ginneries, which deliver them to the farmers (see Figure 3.2). Under the current organization of the seed value chain, this might not be a problem, as both the organic produc- ers and the biotech companies have clear incentives to separate GM seed from other seeds. For producers and ginneries, it would be important to keep seeds used for organic production from mixing with GM seeds, and biotech compa- nies would avoid free recycling of the seed.
Cotton Production Systems
TRADITIONAL SYSTEM
Cotton in Uganda is grown under rainfed conditions largely by smallhold-
ers (Gordon and Goodland 2000). As a rainfed system, cotton production is dependent on rainfall patterns. Climatic events, especially variability in pre- cipitation, can severely affect cotton yields. The timeliness of the precipita- tion can determine a good or bad year for the crop. Production therefore varies considerably among the years. In the 2006/07 season for instance, rains were not timely, some areas were hit by hailstorms during crucial stages, and in other regions there was not enough moisture in the soil for boll formation. During that season, Uganda produced 75,000 metric tons5 of seed cotton, recording an average yield of just 483 kilograms/hectare (FAO 2010). This production resulted in a total of 24,790 tons of lint (Cotton Development Organisation 2008). Even though the area cultivated increased from 100,000 hectares in 2005/06 to 150,000 hectares in 2006/07, yields declined in the same period. In the 2007/08 season there was a sharp decline in total cotton production. Total lint produced was only 12,303 tons, merely 65 percent of the total pro- duced in the previous season.
 5 All tons are metric tons in the chapter.

Although climatic events can considerably affect cotton performance, institutional factors are also crucial determinants of the low output and high variability. The productivity of cotton in Uganda is below international and regional averages, even though in the past years seed cotton yields have regis- tered their highest records since 1960.6 CDO acknowledges the limited avail- ability of high-quality inputs, including seed, extension, and credit, as the major reason for the poor performance of the cotton subsector. Not only are inputs expensive or unaffordable for small producers, but their availability is also limited. Access to production inputs like fertilizers or high-quality seed is difficult to predict. Usually, the cotton season starts when seeds are made available to farmers by ginneries. Given the vertical integration and articula- tion of the chain, it is not uncommon that delays in the delivery of seed and other inputs occur. This situation was particularly severe for the 2007/08 sea- son, when the ginneries dropped their production support program (Cotton Development Organisation 2008).
ORGANIC SYSTEM
Uganda and Tanzania are the first organic cotton producers in the African continent (Moseley and Gray 2008). In Uganda, organic cotton production started in about 1994 (Ogwang, Sekamatte, and Tindyebwa 2005) when the Export Promotion of Organic Product from Africa began the Lango Organic Project in Lira and Apac districts. The project was promoted by a Dutch trader in organic textiles (Bo Weevil BV), and it was established as a business- oriented enterprise (Tulip and Ton 2002). By 2004 there were almost
38,000 certified organic farmers in Uganda, almost one-third of them produc- ing cotton (Taylor 2006).
In Lango, cotton is produced in rotation with sesame, an oilseed crop that commands a much higher productivity and market price compared to cot- ton. Farmers do not have many alternatives to cotton in this rotation system. In general, productivity of cotton in the northern region is considerably lower in the northernmost districts. In theory, organic ginneries buy the cotton from farmers at a premium price, but after discounting for the transport and gin- ning services, this premium price is not actually realized by the organic farmer. Dunavant is the only company that has certified organic ginneries. Other organic ginneries, namely Copcot and Lango Cooperative Union, segregate areas for organic production, according to their needs.
6 According to FAOSTAT, cotton seed yield in 2009 was greater than 900 kilograms/hectare (FAO 2010).

70 CHAPTER 3
Table 3.1 shows the rapid expansion of organic cotton production since 2000. From 2000 to 2006, organic cotton production expanded at an average rate of 2 percent. This rate increased to 9 percent in the 2006/07 season. The main reasons for this positive trend were the growing interest of farmers in a crop system that requires lower use of often unaffordable inputs and the possibility of obtaining a premium price for their product. In the most recent season that we have information about (2007/08), the production share of organic cotton was even higher (20 percent), showing a still-growing interest in the organic system.
The main concern related to potential GM cotton introduction and adop- tion in Uganda is the coexistence of an organic system with a conventional system that is using GM seed. The positions of the government and of CDO toward organic production are not completely clear. In a way, the political sup- port for this production system needs to be clarified before GM is introduced. Coexistence is possible, but the steps to support this coexistence have to be designed and implemented ahead of GM introduction to avoid contamination and thus damage to organic cotton exports.
Methodology
The evaluation of the potential impact of GM cotton seed in Uganda was done using partial budgets and stochastic analysis. Given that GM cotton has not yet been planted in Uganda, the study was based on assumptions about specific variables that determine cotton profitability, such as GM prices and adoption rates. These assumptions, summarized in Table 3.2, are crucial to the

results of the economic evaluation. The use of different scenarios based on the variability of these assumptions gives an idea of the scope of their impact. Few studies have explicitly recognized the year-to-year variability in farm profits by applying stochastic approaches (Pemsl, Waibel, and Orphal 2004; Hareau, Mills, and Norton 2006) that we address in this study.
Survey Instrument
A survey instrument was implemented to collect information on cotton pro- duction and current practices used. In addition to input use and production questions, the survey elicited information on subjective yield distributions from growers to gauge farmers’ perceptions of the extent of yield losses caused by bollworms and by weeds. Farmers provided information on: (1) cotton yield without the constraint, (2) cotton yield with the constraint without using insecticides, and (3) cotton yield with the constraint and chemical con- trol of the pest. We elicited low, mode, and high values from farmers. Each yield parameter (minimum, maximum, and mode) was used to assess variabil- ity both within and across observations.
The survey information enabled (1) calculation of partial budgets for rep- resentative growers and (2) simulation of partial budgets for various scenarios, including use of varieties that are genetically resistant to bollworm attacks and some other Lepidoptera pests and tolerant to herbicide applications.
Data Collection, Sites, and Sampling
Lira and Kasese are the districts where the GM confined trials have been imple- mented, and they are also the districts selected for evaluating the current cotton production systems and conducting our household interviews. After identify- ing cotton-producing districts, we randomly selected villages with farmers crop- ping cotton in the 2006 and 2007 seasons, three in Lira and seven in Kasese. The distribution of villages followed the proportion of cotton produced in the areas, but it also was intended to give a good representation of organic producers.
A total of 150 household heads were interviewed, 48 in Lira and 102 in Kasese. The households were randomly selected from the list of producers pro- vided by ginneries operating in each region. This was the most complete list
of cotton producers that we could access. Given the nature of the crop and the vertical integration of the system, all cotton producers need to sell their output to a ginnery. The questions were addressed for the 2007 campaign, and some additional recall information was collected for 2006. In some cases, selected producers cultivated more than one plot, but most of them only managed one plot of cotton. The information was analyzed per plot for the 2007 season

only. Plots with incomplete information were not considered in the analy- sis. Thus, the total number of observations in our analysis ended up being 151 plots managed by 129 farmers. Of this total, 35 were plots from 32 pro- ducers located in Lira with only 12 real organic producers,7 and the rest were plots from producers located in Kasese.
Stochastic Budget Analysis
We used basic partial budget analysis augmented with stochastic simulations to evaluate cotton profitability across different scenarios. The scenarios evalu- ated included (1) a conventional cotton producer, (2) an organic cotton pro- ducer, (3) a conventional producer using Bt cotton seed, (4) a conventional producer using HR cotton seed, and (5) a hypothetical case where an organic cotton producer is using a GM seed. Additionally, we artificially classified pro- ducers as “low input” and “high input” to get some insights about the effect of higher input use on cotton performance (see appendix tables 3A.1–3A.5 for details on the descriptive variables used).8 Fertilizer use was considered as a cri- terion to classify high-input producers. Obviously, this classification is also a proxy for income level. Therefore, the category “high-input producers” refers to farmers who use chemical fertilizers and above-average amounts of pesti- cides in our sample. From a total number of 151 observations, only 27 quali- fied as high-input users.
The survey provided information to estimate input use and their costs and derive the partial budgets. The basis for calculating the partial budgets was the comprehensive guide produced by CIMMYT (1988). Cotton seed is distrib- uted free of charge, and thus the value is zero for the producer. This informa- tion was used for the partial budgets of the conventional, organic, high-input, and low-input producers. For the simulated scenarios, we imputed seed costs based on the farmgate price of the cotton seed. Total use of chemical and organic fertilizers and pesticides was reported by farmers and converted to val- ues per hectare. The value of the land was the equivalent of renting it. Average wages paid to hired labor were used to estimate the total family labor costs. This assumption seems reasonable in the production areas studied, where labor markets are active and farmers produce the crops commercially. Male and female labor days were valued equally. Using this information, we estimated
7 When analyzing the data, we noticed that several farmers who called themselves organic cotton producers were using insecticides and chemical fertilizers; therefore, the number of organic pro- ducers dropped considerably.

expected total income, total cost, expected net income, marginal benefit, and benefit/cost ratio for each of the five scenarios.
To introduce variability in the partial budgets, the study used @Risk soft- ware (Palisade Corporation, www.palisade.com/risk/) to estimate candidate distributions for each input variable. Note that in @Risk language, there are two kinds of variables: input variables, which are predetermined, and output variables, which are estimated based on the input variables. @Risk selected
a best-fit distribution for input variables feasible to be obtained from farmers using the survey instrument. For input variables with limited or no informa- tion, we used triangular distributions, defined by low, mode, and high values. The triangular distribution is the simplest distribution to elicit from farm- ers, it approximates the normal distribution, and it is especially useful in cases where no sample data are available (Hardaker et al. 2004). For generation of the variable parameters (low, mode, and high values), we assumed values gen- erated by expert consultation or literature review.
Input variables generated using survey information were yield, output price, pesticide use/cost, herbicide use/cost, and spraying cost (mainly labor). Input variables adjusted to triangular distributions were technology efficiency (trait expression), the technology fee, reduction rates in pesticide use, reduction rates in spraying costs in the case of Bt cotton, and increase rates in herbicide use for the case of HT cotton. Details on the minimum, mode, and maximum values adopted for these variables are reported in Table 3.2.
The @Risk software used the input variables to predict the distribution of the selected output variable (marginal benefit). In this way we not only compare marginal benefits across scenarios but also determine how sensitive the output variable is to changes in each input variable (within a scenario). A tornado graph is used to express the relative impact of a particular input parameter to the output from the simulations. The @Risk program regresses each output variable, in this case marginal benefits, to each of the param- eters included in the simulation with a probability distribution. The result- ing parameter gives an indication of the relative strength of the relationship between parameters and outcome.
Is Cotton Profitable?
Basic statistics of the household and production characteristics of interviewed farmers are presented in Table 3.3. In terms of cotton seed yield, aggregated values are higher than national averages for 2007 (FAO 2010), indicating some selection bias in the sampling.

76 CHAPTER 3
Sample statistics show that household characteristics are comparable across districts, but some production variables behave significantly differently. The age of the household head, level of education, household size, and household composition are similar across sites. Neither is there any significant variation concerning land value, labor use, and years of experience in cotton cultivation. The average farmer interviewed had more than 14 years’ experience working on cotton.
The size of the cotton plot tends to be larger in Kasese. Similarly, seed cotton yield and total benefits generated from cotton production are also higher in Kasese. In contrast, it seems that bollworm infestation levels are higher in Kasese than in Lira, implying that Bt cotton could have a higher success in the Western than in the Northern region. In either case, chemi- cal pesticides are not significantly reducing damage caused by pests or weeds (see Appendix C). A mean comparison of basic statistics between the two districts shows a significant difference in farmers’ experiences in cotton pro- duction (Table 3.3).
Another person besides the household head can manage a cotton plot. So, although the percentage of female household heads in our sample is low (3 percent in Lira and 9 percent in Kasese), the share of plots managed by women can be as high as 50 percent in Kasese and 29 percent in Lira. Nevertheless, when tested for mean differences between plots managed by men or women, none of the variables analyzed behaved significantly differ- ently (Table 3.4).
Traditional Production
The survey data analysis shows that most of the farmers are low-input users (Table 3.5). Some farmers use some type of chemical control to deal with insect pests, but relatively few make use of fertilizers, and almost none of them use herbicides. Cotton is a labor-intensive crop: labor represents more than 50 percent of the total production costs. Labor is primarily used for manual weeding. Weed infestation is therefore another serious constraint in cotton production. In our sample, weeding represents more than 20 percent of the total input costs for both types of producers. Other institutions work- ing in cotton in the area report similar patterns (Agricultural Productivity Enhancement Program, pers. comm., 2008). Results do not confirm the general belief that women mainly handle weeding. In any case, cotton is
a labor-consuming activity, and weeding is particularly labor demanding. So, freeing labor from weeding could allow family members to be available for other economic activities. However, the use of HT seed could have a

negative impact on employment and welfare in the community if there are not many off-farm labor opportunities. Almost all the farmers make use of hired labor.
Productivity of seed cotton for our sample, 386 kilograms/acre (or about 800 kilograms/hectare), is above the reported national average in 2007
(400 kilograms/hectare) but is lower than the average yield registered in 2009.9
On average, bollworms can reduce expected output by more than 70 per- cent. These estimations are based on farmers’ perceptions and may have an upward bias, but they are a good reference to understand the severity of boll- worm infestation in these regions. In addition to bollworms, there are other common biotic stresses, such as aphids, Lygus spp. (a sucking insect), and cot- ton stainers. These biotic constraints combined with high price variability

and the unreliable availability of inputs make cotton production a very risky activity in Uganda. The estimated downside risk—the risk of not being able to cover at least the production cost—for surveyed farmers was more than 40 percent.
Looking at the main cost components, it is evident that farmers invest very little in fertilization. Most of the producers interviewed belong to the cat- egory “low-input producers,” and although they do use pesticides to control for Lepidoptera and other major pests (Lygus spp., Aphis, and so forth), the amount of pesticide used is well below standard recommendations. In contrast, “high-input producers” reported not only higher yields but also higher prices paid for their cotton.

Organic versus Conventional Production
The main purpose for implementing the household survey in Lira was to cover a representative number of organic producers and generate a standard partial budget for an average organic cotton producer. However, only 12 of 35 pro- ducers interviewed complied with the standards of organic production. The rest of the producers admitted using some level of chemical control to deal with heavy pest infestations. In fact, the number of organic farmers in Uganda changes from year to year, as farmers appear to switch from conventional to organic with relative freedom. According to Dunavant representatives, in the 2006/07 season, 11,691 organic farmers were registered and contracted for a total production of 6,600 bales, which accounted for almost one-third of the total production of this company. The number of organic producers, however, dropped significantly during the 2008/09 season (see Table 3.1), as there were serious problems with army bollworms that infested the organic fields. During field observations, it became clear that organic farmers were so concerned about pest attacks that many applied pesticides even if they were not supposed to. Statistical analysis over this small sample of producers would obviously not render meaningful results, but the analysis of the household surveys can still provide some useful insights.
As for any other organic crop, cotton requires a significant amount of labor for manual activities, including insect and weed control. In our sample, labor use represented more than 60 percent of the total cost of production for organic cotton producers, and about one-third of that was labor used in manual weeding. Surveyed farmers reported that the damage caused by boll- worms was more than 50 percent, which is comparatively lower than the reported 76 percent for conventional producers. This difference could be because organic producers do manual control of bollworms, an activity that is quite labor demanding but more effective than the sporadic application of pesticides. Approximately 12 percent of the total investment of conventional producers was on chemical pesticides, whereas organic producers only spent 2 percent on organic pesticides. Organic pesticides include the use of neem extract and other nonchemical applications.
Given these management practices, conventional producers recorded
17 percent margins, whereas organic producers had 5 percent. It is well known that the productivity of organic cotton is lower than that of conventional pro- duction (Ogwang, Sekamatte, and Tindyebwa 2005). This low productivity is somehow compensated for by a price premium that the organic producers get for their output. Yet the organic cotton farmers interviewed were not getting

these price premiums, as the prices reported were comparable to those received by conventional producers. Not only was the profitability of cotton low for both types of producers, but the crop also showed a high downside risk. In the case of organic farming, the downside risk for the 12 farmers interviewed was higher than 50 percent, and for conventional producers it was about 39 per- cent (Table 3.6).

GM Cotton
The use of GM seed was simulated in three scenarios (Table 3.7): Bt cot- ton, HT cotton, and organic cotton plus Bt cotton. Despite the seed- technology advantage, the profitability of cotton production was still very low for all these scenarios but higher than the situation with no technologi- cal change.
The use of GM seed may reduce the downside risk, but this depends on the effectiveness of the technology to control the constraint (e.g., the expression of the trait). An expert from the CDO (D. Lubwana, agronomist with CDO, pers. comm., 2007) reported that yield losses due to bollworms can be as high as 80 percent, which is in agreement with what farmers reported in the sur- vey (on average, about 76 percent). Given these high values, and farmers’ per- ceptions of yield losses due to bollworm attacks and weed infestation, it is not surprising that the margins are higher for both the Bt and the HT cotton sce- narios. Perceptions, however, are usually biased upward, given that it is rather difficult for farmers to isolate the effect of one constraint. The marginal ben- efits of using GM seed are directly related to the level of incidence of the pro- ductivity constraint and the actual damage caused by the biotic constraint.
The HT scenario recorded the highest benefit/cost ratio and the high-
est marginal rate of return of all the likely scenarios.10 The explanation for this result lies in the assumptions used for simulating this scenario. As mentioned earlier, weeding is a labor-intensive activity that needs to be performed regu- larly in a cotton field. Failure to weed has a severe impact on the final yields. Unfortunately, the lack of technical information about weed infestation and weed control in cotton production in Uganda is a major constraint on the model. Thus, the assumptions for this scenario are based on expectations rather than on technical information. In comparison, the impact of Bt cotton has been more thoroughly documented, and there is more information to sup- port the assumptions behind this scenario.
It is important to point out here that a higher yield would probably demand higher labor for agricultural practices, mainly for harvesting. Thus, the margins of all the simulated scenarios are likely to be overestimated. We do not have enough technical information to support more specific assumptions about the potential increase in labor costs, as there can be many factors affect- ing labor use. For instance, if we assume that the labor used for harvesting is proportional to yield increases, we may be overlooking the fact that labor may

82 CHAPTER 3
not be readily available at the critical times or that the household may not have enough financial resources to hire more labor. As shown in Table 3.7, yield increases imputed to GM seed are basically due to the combination of damage- control effects and the technology efficiency, which could be used to represent the upper bound of additional labor used for harvesting under perfect correla- tion. Taking the average values shown in Table 3.7, Bt cotton reports the high- est reduction in marginal benefits (about 30 percent) whereas the organic plus Bt scenario reports the lowest reduction (13 percent). In other words, if the producer uses mainly hired labor, the practice will definitely have an impact on the margins. This type of producer will also invest in other complementary inputs that will contribute to an even better performance of the variety, and thus compensate for the additional investment.
Figure 3.3 presents a graphical analysis of the marginal benefits for all five scenarios evaluated. The distribution of marginal benefits is represented in the histogram, and the tornado graph summarizes the relative impact of a particu- lar input variable on these margins.11 For all scenarios the variability in yield and the high labor costs are the main determinants of the margins generated. A technology that contributes to reduce this yield variability would definitely have an impact on farmers’ welfare.
Conclusions and Policy Recommendations
This study provides an ex ante evaluation of the potential impact of GM cot- ton adoption in Uganda. A survey was used to calculate partial budgets for representative growers and compare partial budgets for various real and simu- lated scenarios. The partial budget of a low-input cotton producer was com- pared with that of a high-input producer. Similarly, we compared the partial budget of a conventional cotton producer with that of an organic producer. The latter two cases were used to develop the simulated scenarios of conven- tional cotton producers using GM seed (both Bt and HT cotton) and organic producers using Bt cotton.
The primary data for this analysis comes from two main cotton- producing districts in Uganda: Kasese and Lira. Partial budgets are used to evaluate the profitability of cotton production and to compare conventional and organic cotton production with hypothetical GM scenarios. We added stochastic simulations to the partial budgets to account for the effects of risk

    and uncertainty related to cotton production and profitability. The sampling framework for the collection of the primary information does not permit the extension of findings to the country level. However, this exercise does provide an initial assessment of the potential impact of GM cotton adoption on farm- ers in the most important cotton districts in Uganda.
Our findings suggest that GM cotton has the potential to contribute to improving the productivity of cotton. However, this technology would proba- bly make only a minor contribution to the performance of cotton in Uganda if the access to high-quality inputs was not properly addressed. Overall, the sim- ulations show that conventional production using Bt and HT cotton varieties

could yield higher returns than either the conventional or the organic system, but the profitability of the crop will not increase dramatically. Our results also show that the largest benefits could be reached in the unlikely case that GM seed (Bt cotton) could be used in organic production. We have mentioned sev- eral times that access to high-quality inputs is critical to improve cotton per- formance in Uganda. From the perspective of a conventional production, this alternative deserves consideration. On the one hand, the current conventional cotton production uses minimal amounts of inputs and approximates the organic system. On the other hand, the investment and institutional changes needed to reach this goal are probably not feasible in the short run. Although our sample size, especially the number of observations for organic producers, does not allow us to make extensive conclusions, this is an area that needs fur- ther exploration.
The vertical integration of the chain could facilitate the dissemination of GM technology, but the availability of seed and inputs of good quality and appropriate extension support have to be guaranteed. Some problems exist with respect to seed quality, and it is not clear how the introduction of GM seed could solve these problems. For instance, it is necessary to improve the ginning quality in the country. Regardless of the type of seed or farming sys- tem used, investment in fertilizers, high-quality seed, and other agronomic and management practices are crucial to improve the profitability of cotton in Uganda.
In the case of Bt and HT cotton, farmers are not using significant levels of pesticides and herbicides, and therefore the expected reduction of both chemi- cals would be small. If yield losses due to bollworms are lower than reported
by farmers (as in a low-incidence year), then the profitability of this tech- nology will dramatically decrease. In this regard, it does make sense to frame the introduction of the GM cotton technology as an insurance protecting Ugandan farmers from catastrophic or severe losses stemming from target pests and weeds.
The assessment of other sectors of the economy, national industry, trading status, and the institutional environment also need to be addressed to get a full picture of the potential impact of GM cotton in Uganda. For instance, at the national level, the technology fee charged by the innovator largely affects the benefits generated by the adoption of GM cotton. Because cotton seed is cur- rently distributed free of charge, it is clear that, before releasing the technol- ogy, Uganda needs to develop a strategy to negotiate with the developer of the technology the fee that will be charged to farmers. Similarly, the coexistence of organic and conventional cotton production using GM seed could be possible

if institutional arrangements are implemented beforehand to avoid contamina- tion and damaging organic exports.
A critical point in the case of the HT cotton scenario is farmers’ abilities to apply the herbicide glyphosate. Very few farmers in the survey reported herbi- cide use, much less glyphosate, either because of the high costs of this input or its unavailability. If farmers cannot access glyphosate, then they will probably revert to manual weeding, with a direct impact on yield and expected bene- fits. There is also the issue of training in the use of herbicides and understand- ing the concept of herbicide tolerance and its implications for herbicide use. This raises a policy question that developers and policymakers in Uganda must address to ensure capturing the potential benefits of the technology. It would be worthwhile to explore in more detail whether a program to improve train- ing and access to herbicides is warranted.
A question partially addressed by this study is whether reducing down- side risk to cotton farmers in Uganda by reducing insect and weed damage compensates for the cost and effort in introducing a complex technology. It is important to take into account the additional inputs needed to enable dam- age control (such as the herbicide glyphosate), and changes in management practices (such as the need for scouting to ensure that insect pressures do not overwhelm Bt protection level) will determine how transferable the GM tech- nology is and how easily it can be adopted by Ugandan farmers.
Although it is possible to compare the profitability of a given year of organic cotton production with conventional cotton production using
GM seed, this gives only a small part of the picture. Because we are inter- ested in contributing to poverty alleviation, it is much more significant— but at the same time challenging—to evaluate the long-term contribution of either system to the farmers’ welfare. This is a research topic that needs fur- ther attention.

Chapter 4
Benefits, Costs, and Consumer Perceptions of the Potential Introduction of a Fungus-Resistant Banana in Uganda and Policy Implications
Enoch M. Kikulwe, Ekin Birol, Justus Wesseler, and José Falck-Zepeda
Banana is a staple crop in Uganda. Ugandans have the highest per capita consumption of cooking bananas in the world (Clarke 2003). However, banana production in Uganda is limited by several productivity con-
straints, such as insects, diseases, soil depletion, and poor agronomic practices. To address these constraints, the country has invested significant resources in research and development (R&amp;D) and other publicly funded programs, pur- suing approaches over both the short and long term. Uganda formally initi- ated its short-term approach in the early 1990s; it involves the collection of both local and foreign germplasms for the evaluation and selection of cultivars tolerant to the productivity constraints. The long-term approach, launched
in 1995, includes breeding for resistance to the productivity constraints using conventional breeding methods and genetic engineering. Genetic engineer- ing projects in Uganda target the most popular and infertile cultivars that can- not be improved through conventional (cross) breeding. The main objective of genetic engineering in Uganda is to develop genetically modified (GM) cul- tivars that are resistant to local pests and diseases, have improved agronomic attributes, and are acceptable to consumers (Kikulwe et al. 2007).
The introduction of a GM banana in Uganda is not without contro- versy. In Uganda, where the technology of genetic engineering is still in its infancy, it is likely to generate a wide portfolio of concerns, as it has in other African countries. According to the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST) (2006), the main public concern is the safety of the technology for the environment and human health.
Several countries have designed and implemented policies to address
the safety concerns of consumers and producers (Beckmann, Soregaroli,
and Wesseler 2006a,b). Such policies include assessment, management, and communication of the biosafety profiles of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) (Falck-Zepeda 2006). As a consequence of its international obliga- tions and the need to guarantee a socially accepted level of safety to its citizens,
 99

100 CHAPTER 4
Uganda has taken significant steps to ensure the safety of GM biotechnol- ogy applications. GM banana varieties will need to undergo biosafety assess- ments1 and receive the regulatory approval of the country’s National Biosafety Committee before being approved for research, confined field trials, and release into the environment for commercialization.2
However, the biosafety regulatory process has several economic conse- quences, as biosafety regulations are not costless endeavors. Kalaitzandonakes, Alston, and Bradford (2007) calculate the compliance costs for regulatory approval of herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant (Bt) maize to be on the order of about 7–50 million US dollars (US$). They note that the approval costs for similar types of GM crops will be alike. In addition, biosafety- testing requirements can consume significant amounts of time—from a few months to several years. A delay in the approval of a new variety forestalls access to the potential benefits generated by farmer adoption of the technol- ogy, and one can expect such costs to be substantially higher than the regula- tory compliance costs (Wesseler, Scatasta, and Nillesen 2007).
Jaffe (2006) has noted that existing drafts of Uganda’s biotechnology and biosafety policy stress the importance of the socioeconomic implications of the technology for biosafety regulation, but that author also observes a lack
of precision in identifying the socioeconomic aspects and how they should be considered. In fact, Article 26.1 of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity gives countries the choice of whether to include socioeconomic considerations in the biosafety assessment process con- sistent with other international treaties, although limited to the context of bio- diversity ( Jaffe 2006). Article 26.1’s “may take into account” clause has been applied strictly in some countries, such as India, where the socioeconomic con- sideration is mandatory for biosafety applications.
Many countries, including Uganda, have not determined whether and how to include socioeconomic considerations, at what stage of the regulatory pro- cess to include them, and what the scope and decisionmaking process within biosafety regulations should be. In fact, some biosafety experts (and some countries) have resisted including a socioeconomic assessment as a mandatory part in the biosafety decisionmaking process, as in their view, such issues may
1 The original scope of biosafety as described in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety was environ- mental safety. However, over time the original scope has been expanded to include food and feed safety in terms of toxicity or allergenicity. In this chapter, it is therefore understood that the label biosafety includes both environmental and food/feed safety.
2 Five technologies have been approved for confined field trial testing in Uganda: a virus-
resistant cassava, a weevil-resistant sweet potato, an insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant cotton, a fungus-resistant banana, a bacteria-resistant banana, and a nutrition-enhanced banana.
 
BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 101
cloud that process and distract regulators from the scientific/technical issues related directly to biosafety. It is worthwhile to note that inclusion of socio- economic considerations for biosafety regulatory approval at the laboratory/ greenhouse or confined field trial stages contributes very little to the decision- making process, as the material will not enter the food chain and thus will not be commercialized until it is given regulatory approval further along in the process. Therefore, a major objective of this chapter is to illustrate the rele- vance of socioeconomic analyses for supporting biotechnology decisionmak- ing (and in particular, the importance of consumer perceptions) but also for contributing to the development and implementation of biosafety regulations. We present a general approach using the GM banana as an example, assuming the GM banana has passed standard food safety and biosafety assessments and thus can be considered to be safe.
The GM banana is the pioneer staple foodcrop in Uganda developed through modern biotechnology. Though different transgenic traits are being developed (see Shotkoski et al. 2010), in this chapter our focus is on a fungus- resistant GM banana with a trait resistant to the airborne fungal leaf-spot dis- ease known as black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis), which can reduce yields by 30–50 percent. The development of an agronomic trait possessing this fungal disease resistance is important, as the new banana can substan- tially increase yields, which would directly improve the livelihoods of farmers (Kikulwe, Wesseler, and Falck-Zepeda 2008; Kikulwe 2010). The bananas tar- geted for modification are the East African endemic cultivars, including cook- ing bananas that are mostly grown and highly preferred by consumers.
Given the importance of the crop, a better understanding of the socio- economic effects of introducing a GM banana is desirable to build public con- fidence in the technology and its implications for food security. In addition, assessing the potential benefits as well as the economic welfare will shed light on the question of under which conditions will Uganda in particular, and African countries in general, gain from GM crops without making a particular population segment worse off. Specifically, five sets of research questions are addressed in this study:
1. What are the expected social incremental benefits and costs under the con- ditions of irreversibility, flexibility, and uncertainty of introducing GM bananas in Uganda?
2. What are consumers’ knowledge about and attitudes and perceptions toward introducing GM bananas in Uganda? How do they differ between rural and urban households? Do consumers know, and have trust in, the

102 CHAPTER 4
institutions responsible for regulating, releasing, and selling GM crops in Uganda?
3. How does preference heterogeneity influence choice of banana bunch attributes across individual households? What are the differences between consumer preferences in urban and rural households for banana bunch attributes?
4. How much are consumers willing to pay for the values accruing from GM bananas given a social benefit? How does this willingness compare across different segments of consumers?
5. What are the impacts of introducing GM bananas on food security in Uganda? What implications does introduction have for biosafety regula- tions in general?
In the following sections, we discuss the benefits that a GM banana could
provide to producers and consumers in Uganda and the role of biosafety reg- ulations in governing the introduction of a GM banana. The results of a real option model are presented that show how concerns about environmental risks can be considered in a cost-benefit analysis as a first step toward a socio- economic assessment of introducing a GM banana in Uganda.
In addition, we show how the results of the economic analysis can be combined with the consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a GM banana using a choice experiment model. We explicitly demonstrate how one can
use both random-parameter logit and latent-segment models to capture and account for heterogeneity among consumer preferences given a tangible eco- nomic benefit of the GM banana.3 The study complements and extends the dimensions of previous research (Li et al. 2003; Loureiro and Bugbee 2005; Knight et al. 2007) on consumers’ WTP for GM food by, first, incorporating the forgone economic benefits of a delay in release and, second, incorporating producers as consumers in the sample. The approach is unique in its applica- tion to banana varieties in a developing-country context.
Before presenting the results of the WTP analysis, results of consumer knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP) toward the GM banana and its regulation are introduced. The consumer perceptions presented in this chap- ter hold numerous implications for scientists, policymakers (regulators), the public, and other stakeholders.
3 A tangible economic benefit refers to a benefit forgone if the GM banana is not introduced immediately.
 
BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 103
The aim of this chapter is to mention and discuss a range of these implica- tions. The contribution is structured as follows. The next section discusses in more detail the relevance of a GM banana for Uganda. The following section introduces an overview of biosafety regulations in Uganda. The subsequent section presents the overall approach and explains its application. The main results are then reported, followed by a section on the policy implications of the empirical findings for decisionmaking on biotechnology and biosafety reg- ulations in Uganda for the GM banana in particular, and other GM crops in general. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed in the final section.
Relevance of a GM Banana for Uganda
Banana is one of the most important crops in Uganda, with approximately
7 million people, or 26 percent of the population, depending on the plant as a source of food and income. Bananas are estimated to occupy 1.5 million hect- ares of the total arable land, or 38 percent of the cultivated land, in the country (Rubaihayo 1991; Rubaihayo and Gold 1993). The plant is grown primarily as a subsistence crop in rural areas, although consumption is not limited to rural areas, as approximately 65 percent of urban consumers in Uganda have a meal of the cooking variety of banana at least once a day. Ugandans have the highest per capita consumption of cooking bananas in the world (Clarke 2003).
Most banana varieties grown in Uganda are endemic to the East African highlands—a region recognized as a secondary center of banana diver-
sity (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Swennen and Vuylsteke 1991; Smale and Tushemereirwe 2007). The endemic banana varieties (AAA–EA genomic group) consist of two use-determined types: cooking bananas (matooke)
and beer bananas (mbidde). Karamura (1998) recognized 238 names of East African highland banana varieties in Uganda, with 84 clones grouped into five clone sets. The nonendemic clones include dessert bananas (varieties that are consumed raw), some beer bananas (varieties suitable for beer and juice mak- ing), and roasting bananas (or plantains).
Banana yields in Uganda are severely reduced by several pests and dis- eases. Among the pests that cause the most yield damage are weevils (Cosmopolites sordidus) and nematodes (Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus goodeyi, and Helicotylenchus multicinctus). The diseases that contribute
to the worst yield losses in Uganda are the soilborne fungal Panama dis- ease, or Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum); bacterial wilts, including the banana Xanthomonas wilt (Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum); and

104 CHAPTER 4
the airborne fungal leaf-spot disease black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijien- sis Morelet) (Gold 1998, 2000; Gold et al. 1998; Gold, Pena, and Karamura 2001; Tushemereirwe et al. 2003b).
Consequently, the National Banana Research Program of the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) in Uganda has developed a breeding program that employs a range of traditional crop-breeding meth-
ods and a portfolio of biotechnologies to address the crop’s most debilitating problems caused by pests and diseases (Kikulwe et al. 2007). The short-
term breeding strategy includes the assembly of local and foreign germplasms for evaluation and selection of varieties resistant or tolerant to existing produc- tivity constraints. Resistance to a limited set of pests and diseases (for example, black Sigatoka) was identified in hybrid banana varieties. Though character- ized by bigger bunches, the hybrid varieties are not widely grown in Uganda (Nowakunda 2001; Smale and Tushemereirwe 2007). Producers and consum- ers prefer the East African highland cooking bananas, but these are also highly susceptible to black Sigatoka (Nowakunda et al. 2000; Nowakunda 2001)
and bacterial wilts (Tushemereirwe et al. 2003a). Susceptibility to diseases prompted the national researchers to adopt a long-term breeding strategy that includes the generation of new genotypes and other new approaches to intro- duce resistance.
The highest yielding highland cooking bananas proved to be sterile, which slows down their improvement through conventional breeding (Ssebuliba 2001; Ssebuliba et al. 2006). With major biotic constraints not easily addressed through conventional breeding and management practices, recent efforts have been made to employ genetic engineering for the insertion of resis- tance traits into selected banana background planting material. Unlike cross- breeding, genetic engineering allows for improving the agronomic traits (for example, disease and pest resistance), as genes are inserted into potential host varieties (cultivars) while not changing other production and product attri- butes (for example, cooking quality). The genetic modification approach has shown potential for the improvement of the crop (Tripathi 2003).
Edmeades and Smale (2006) argue that the choice of a host variety for a genetic transformation largely determines its acceptability by producers and consumers. In those regions strongly affected by biotic constraints, it is likely that GM banana cultivars will be more beneficial to poorer and subsistence- oriented farmers. In addition, the insertion of multiple traits into East African highland bananas, although associated with additional R&amp;D costs (for exam- ple, transformation and regulatory costs), could further increase the benefits generated by the adoption of the technology in Uganda. Multiple traits may

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 105
also increase adoption rates, as farmers may not immediately notice the benefi- cial effect of a single trait.
Although GM bananas look promising for large-scale (mass clonal) multiplication and dissemination, empirical evidence of the success of such organisms is still limited. Long-term multiplication of micropropagated (tissue-cultured) plants, for example, may lead to epigenetic4 (somaclonal) variations. Additionally, genetic uniformity in a trait intensifies the probabil- ity of mutations in the targeted pest or disease that overcome resistance and increase epidemic vulnerability. These two aspects raise questions about the clonal fidelity of offspring plants and their genetic stability, both affecting eco- nomic benefits of GM banana varieties. In this context biosafety measures to monitor, evaluate, and mitigate effects of such occurrences become critical for the appropriate deployment of the technology in Uganda.
Despite these possible effects on the persistence of economic benefits of a GM banana, it is important to note that throughout the chapter we assume the GM banana has been proven safe for human health and the environment according to standard safety assessments.
Biosafety Regulations in Uganda
Uganda is among the few African countries that have invested in agricultural GM crop R&amp;D and have initiated procedures for confined field trials to evalu- ate GM technologies (Atanassov et al. 2004).5 The country has taken signifi- cant steps to ensure safety in biotechnology application (Nampala, Mugoya, and Ssengooba 2005). Biosafety regulations and, to a degree, biotechnol-
ogy developments in Uganda are governed in the context of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (GOU 2002b, 2004). Uganda signed the protocol in May 2000 and ratified it in November 2001 (GOU 2004; Wafula and Clark 2005). UNCST is the institution responsible for implementation of the bio- safety protocol and is the protocol’s designated competent authority. UNCST
4 Epigenetic changes are changes that do not affect the DNA sequence of genes but change the gene in other ways. These changes may be induced spontaneously in response to environmental factors or to the presence of a particular allele, even if it is absent from subsequent generations. Modgil et al. (2005) note that the in vitro process, length of in vitro culture, and in vitro stress stemming from unnatural and nutritional conditions are some of the factors believed to induce epigenetic changes.
5 The GM banana field trials were approved by the National Biosafety Committee and have been established at Kawanda by NARO. Note that Uganda now joins the other five African coun-
tries that have conducted confined field trials of GM crops: Burkina Faso, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Of those, only Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa have approved crops for commercialization.
 
106 CHAPTER 4
established the National Biosafety Committee (NBC), a technical evaluation arm, in 1996. NBC is responsible for reviewing applications and implement- ing general biosafety guidelines and regulations (GOU 2004; Wafula and Clark 2005).
Currently, the basis for the development and application of biotechnol- ogy is the National Science and Technology Policy of 2001 (GOU 2004). The National Science and Technology Policy provides general reference to biotechnology within the broader context of the role of science and technol- ogy in national development. The responsibilities of the various institutions and agencies involved in the approval process for biotechnology products have been outlined in the Biosafety Framework of 2000. The National Biosafety Framework, which was developed by UNCST, is based on the United Nations Environment Programme’s International Technical Guidelines on Safety in Biotechnology (enacted in 2001). Those guidelines provide terms of reference for NBC and the institutional biosafety committees—detailed information on risk assessment and management procedures for microbes, inspection, and approval (Traynor 2003).
Under the National Biosafety Framework, UNCST has the mandate of approving GMOs for research purposes, confined release into the environ- ment, and commercial planting in Uganda. UNCST receives all applications for research on or the deliberate introduction of GMOs, conducts a screening for completeness, and enters the applications into the national public records as submitted, before forwarding them to NBC for review and risk assessment evaluation. The complete risk assessment is done by the applicant. The NBC is obliged to review the risk assessment dossiers submitted by the applicant after the application has been assessed by the institutional biosafety commit- tees and finally advises UNCST.
The members of NBC are stakeholders, such as representatives from reg- ulatory agencies, the scientific community, universities, the private sector,
and civil society (Nampala, Mugoya, and Ssengooba 2005). The NBC is also responsible for writing the draft National Biotechnology and Biosafety Policy, the draft National Biosafety Regulations (GOU 2004), and the Guidelines on Biosafety in Biotechnology for Uganda (GOU 2002a), and for develop- ing draft manuals addressing specific issues surrounding biosafety regulations, such as confidential business information. These documents make up the bio- safety regulatory framework for Uganda. At this time, the documents still need to be approved by the government ( Jaffe 2006). The implementation
of the finally agreed-upon biosafety regulations for a specific GM crop will be managed by UNCST. UNCST is advised by the National Biotechnology

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 107
Advisory Committee, which is an interministerial committee including rep- resentatives from key institutions in biotechnology development and NBC (GOU 2004).
Applications for the import and export of GMOs are also approved by NBC. The government of Uganda (GOU 2005, 6) stipulates that “any per- son, prior to intentionally introducing a GMO shall apply to the Competent Authority for authorization. In case of imports, the exporter or the Competent Authority in the country of export may submit an application on behalf of an applicant, and may designate in the application with whom the Competent Authority shall communicate regarding the application.” In the case of field testing, the government of Uganda (GOU 2005, 7) continues to specify that “the applicant shall document to the Competent Authority that participating personnel will have appropriate training [and] that the field test will be over- seen by an individual possessing appropriate technical expertise.” The com- petent authority has to reply within 90 days. Within a period of not more than 270 days after the scientific risk assessment, the competent authority will make a final decision on whether to approve or deny the applicant the author- ity to introduce the GMO. Thus, if all the required documents are submit-
ted and complete, the approval will take about one year. In the case of a denial of a request, the applicant is given 30 days to appeal with genuine reasons or additional relevant information, and the competent authority has 30 days to render a final decision. The competent authority will finally make public any proposal about the intentional introduction of GMOs. The public is given not more than 60 days to submit comments, which the competent authority will take into consideration before the final decision is made.
According to Wafula and Clark (2005), NARO submitted applications
to UNCST in 2000 to introduce Bt cotton and Bt maize, but they were not approved for confined field trials. One of the reasons UNCST gave was that Uganda was unprepared to handle GM crops, because it lacked a national bio- technology and biosafety policy. In addition, Uganda lacked confinement and containment facilities for GMO field trials. Recently, the government selected biotechnology as one of the priority areas in its plan for the modernization of agriculture (OPM 2005). Consequently, substantial investments have been made in institutional development and capacity building for agricultural bio- technology and biosafety.
Jaffe (2006) analyzed and compared biosafety regulatory systems in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania using the African Model Law, which is one of the documents given consideration throughout Africa when a country begins drafting laws and regulations to address biosafety. Jaffe’s assessment considered

108 CHAPTER 4
key issues, such as comprehensiveness, transparency, participation, and effi- ciency of the regulatory systems. In the context of Uganda’s existing biosafety regulatory framework, despite all the efforts that have been made, the author notes some shortcomings, particularly in the areas of transparency and clar-
ity regarding the process to be followed, so that all interested stakeholders are able to understand and meet the requirements of the regulatory process. Those shortcomings include, first, no clear indications of how the assessment of the potential food-safety risks that might arise from the GMOs will be handled. Second, even though UNCST is involved in the formulation of the biosafety regulation policy, the statute authorizing its creation does not provide legal authority to regulate GMOs. Neither the biosafety policy nor the government regulations establish a clear safety standard for approving a GMO. Third, the documents contain no elaborations on how and what socioeconomic consid- erations will be considered, how they will be analyzed, by whom, and how they will be considered in the decisionmaking process.
This chapter seeks to address the third shortcoming by providing informa- tion that, indeed, socioeconomic issues of introducing GMOs in Uganda are relevant. It also presents methods to identify socioeconomic issues and pro- vides suggestions for addressing them.
Approach and Implementation
The framework of the research comprises two approaches: real options and a choice experiment. The latter relates the economic benefits to potential con- sumer concerns. Primary and secondary data sources were used for this study. Primary data were generated from a survey conducted in three administra-
tive regions, Eastern, Central, and Southwestern Uganda, comprising three distinct agroecological zones where cooking bananas (green bananas) are produced and consumed. The study was implemented in July and August 2007 with face-to-face interviews. Six enumerators were hired and trained specifically for this study. In implementing the survey, enumerators briefly described the context of the study and informed the respondents that there were no wrong or right answers but their opinions were of interest. A total of 421 households, drawn with a random sample stratified into rural and urban households using the then-current community listings of 21 randomly selected communities, allowed us to draw general conclusions (Figure 4.1).
The survey questionnaire was designed to collect information on the respondents’ observed characteristics. First, each respondent was asked ques- tions about his/her KAP regarding GM crops and food. In part two, social,

 demographic, and economic information on the households was collected, including the characteristics of the banana purchase, decisionmaker(s), and other members of the household. The final part consisted of the choice experi- ment. The detailed description of the study area, the questionnaire, and the information provided to the respondents is reported in Kikulwe (2010). Secondary data are taken from the database of a NARO/International Food Policy Research Institute project conducted between 2003 and 2004 in Uganda. The dataset is complemented by data for banana production for 1980 through 2004 obtained from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS 2006) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2006).
Different econometric models were applied to the datasets to test hypoth- eses related to the five research questions. A real option model was used to esti- mate the maximum incremental socially tolerable irreversible costs (MISTICs) for GM bananas, providing a maximum threshold value for consumer

110 CHAPTER 4
perceived irreversible costs of introducing GM bananas, as explained in more detail in Kikulwe (2010) and Kikulwe, Wesseler, and Falck-Zepeda (2008).
An explanatory factor analysis was applied to investigate the underly- ing latent structure of the KAP data. Random-parameter logit models and latent class models were then applied to investigate consumers’ preference heterogeneity for banana attributes in the choice data. Finally, we compared the MISTICs with the willingness to pay for GM bananas to derive pol-
icy implications.
Overview of Findings
To achieve the overall aim of this study, five research questions were addressed. This section presents the highlights for each research question.
1. What are the expected social incremental benefits and costs under the con- ditions of irreversibility, flexibility, and uncertainty of introducing GM bananas in Uganda?
A real option approach6 (see Appendix 4A) was followed to analyze the
social incremental benefits and costs (that is, the MISTICs) and social incre- mental reversible benefits (SIRBs). Irreversibilities and uncertainties have been considered in the literature on introducing GM crops (for example, Wesseler, Scatasta, and Nillesen 2007). Scatasta, Wesseler, and Demont (2006) introduced the term MISTICs to identify the threshold value for consum-
ers’ WTP for not having a GM crop introduced. The MISTICs associated with the adoption of a GM banana in Uganda were calculated using equa- tion 4A.1 in Appendix 4A and presented for different risk-free and risk- adjusted rates of return, as shown in Table 4.1. The results showed the MISTICs to be between approximately US$176 million and US$359 mil- lion per year, or between US$282 and US$451 per hectare per year. In the sce- nario with a risk-adjusted rate of return of 12 percent and a risk-free rate of interest of 4 percent—which we considered to be a reasonable scenario based on the results of Mitthöfer (2005)—the annual MISTICs per household are about US$38. This result can be interpreted as follows: the immediate release of the GM banana should be postponed or abandoned only if the average

household is willing to give up more than US$38 per year for not having such a banana introduced.
In the case where approval of the GM banana is delayed due to missing regulatory procedures and protocols, Uganda will forgo potential benefits (SIRBs) in the approximate range of US$179 million to US$365 million per year. This forgone benefit can be an indicator of how much Uganda can pay to compensate for potential damages. Additionally, the SIRBs provide a clue about the maximum costs farmers would endure to comply with biosafety of about US$303 per hectare. Adopters of the GM banana would not be will- ing to pay more than US$200 per hectare per year in transaction costs—that is, costs to comply with biosafety regulations, R&amp;D costs, and technology transfer costs. If the average WTP per hectare of a banana-growing household is below the MISTICs, but biosafety regulators are inclined to implement

112 CHAPTER 4
biosafety regulations to address concerns of consumers with a high WTP for not having the GM banana, those additional costs should not exceed US$200 on average per year per hectare planted to GM bananas. Assuming a maximum of 541,530 hectares that may be planted with GM bananas in Uganda, this implies that the maximum total costs to bring the GM banana to Ugandan producers cannot exceed US$108 million. Otherwise, the GM banana is not a viable alternative.
Based on the MISTICs results, it is evident that Uganda loses from not introducing a fungus-resistant GM banana. But only if the average household is willing to give up more than US$38 annually for not having GM bananas introduced should an immediate release be postponed. This analysis demon- strates a relationship between agricultural policy, R&amp;D, technology delivery, and impact, which shows an inverse relationship between stringency (pre- cautionary approaches) and technology delivery. That is, the more stringent the approval process is, the greater will be the potential benefits that are for- gone annually, which negatively affects both the scientists and the technology end users.
2. What are the consumers’ knowledge about and attitudes and perceptions toward introducing GM bananas in Uganda? How do they differ between rural and urban households? Do consumers know, and have trust in, the institutions responsible for regulating, releasing, and selling GM crops
in Uganda?
As little is known about consumer KAP toward the GM banana in Uganda, an explanatory factor analysis was applied to investigate the underlying latent structure of the KAP data. The analysis of KAPs reveals the presence of three categories, including benefit, food-environment risk, and health risk KAPs. The KAP toward GM crops among rural and urban consumers varies, owing to a number of socioeconomic characteristics, suggesting a rural–urban bias. Given quality benefits, consumers are more willing to accept GM bananas, but at the same time they are concerned about the unknown negative effects of
the technology. Results show that rural consumers value the quality benefits, whereas urban consumers are more concerned about the safety of the technol- ogy (Table 4.2). Education and income have negative effects on GM banana acceptability. Results further indicate that there is a relatively high level of awareness and trust in local leaders and extension workers. Respondents were less aware of UNCST and the Consumer Education Trust, the two main agen- cies responsible for informing consumers about GM food.

114 CHAPTER 4
In conclusion, we argue that delaying the approval of a fungus-resistant GM banana in Uganda is more in line with the preferences of urban (in par- ticular, the better educated and wealthier) consumers than with rural ones. But how can the negative perceptions among the urban and wealthier ones become positive or neutral at best? There is a need to ensure transparency and par- ticipation but to strike a balance with the feasibility of a system. However, if the system is not participatory and does not respect dissenting opinions, then legitimacy is taken from it. If this is the case, then people tend not to respect the regulatory system. The main lesson is for NARO and the government of Uganda to develop in advance communication strategies to ensure proper dis- cussion and address potential concerns.
3. How does preference heterogeneity influence choice of banana bunch attributes across individual households? What are the differences between consumer preferences in urban and rural households for banana bunch attributes?
The heterogeneity in consumers’ preferences for different banana attributes in Uganda was investigated using choice experiment data. The analysis of the choice data took into consideration preference heterogeneity resulting from locational and household-level characteristics. This helped to test whether consumers in rural and urban locations value banana attributes differently.
A random-parameter logit model7 was applied to investigate the heterogene- ity preference for the banana bunch attributes. Interactions of respondent- specific household characteristics with choice-specific attributes in the utility function were included in the model to account for the source of unobserved heterogeneity. This provided insights about differences in consumer valua- tion of the GM technology in addition to explaining the aggregate economic value associated with such technology, similar to the policy-change effect as analyzed by Boxall and Adamowicz (2002). Recent applications of random- parameter logit models (for example, Breffle and Morey 2000; Carlsson, Frykblom, and Liljenstolpe 2003; Kontoleon 2003; Morey and Rossmann 2003) have revealed that this model is superior to the conditional logit
7 The random-parameter logit model estimates both the mean coefficient and standard devia- tion of the random parameters. It is imperative to note the following. First, if the standard devia- tion estimate is not significantly different from zero, then one can conclude that the preference parameter is constant across the population. Second, if the mean coefficient is zero (or signifi- cantly smaller than the standard deviation) with a significant estimated standard deviation,
then there is preference diversity (that is, both positive and negative). Third, if both the mean coefficient and estimated standard deviation are insignificant, then the attribute has no impact on choices.

model in terms of overall fit and welfare estimates. In this chapter, there-
fore, a random-parameter logit model was applied, as shown in Appendix 4B. This was followed by a random-parameter logit model including interactions of respondent-specific characteristics with banana bunch attributes to provide more information about the sources of variation in preferences across respon- dents (see equation 4B.3). The selected respondent-specific characteristics included (1) household size (HHSIZE); (2) whether or not the respondent had postsecondary education (EDUC); (3) log of household monthly income (INCOME); (4) age of the respondent (AGE); (5) whether or not the house- hold grows bananas (GROW); (6) whether or not the household was found in the Eastern region (EAST); and (7) whether or not the household was found in the Southwestern region (SWEST). Findings reveal that there is substantial conditional and unconditional heterogeneity, as accounted for by the random- parameter logit model with interactions, carried out for each location (urban and rural) separately (Table 4.3).
The impacts of social and economic characteristics of the consumers on their valuation of the banana bunch attributes were significant, indicating the importance of considering such characteristics in explaining the sources of conditional heterogeneity. Even though bunch size is valued highly by both rural and urban households, urban and rural preferences differ concerning the introduction of a GM banana. The low-income rural households with larger household sizes value the GM technology that generates benefits to produc- ers more highly than do the urban ones. Conversely, respondents with higher education were found to be more critical of the GM technology, which would negatively influence their willingness to accept the GM banana. Statistical tests confirm that there are significant differences in preferences for banana bunch attributes between urban and rural households in Uganda.
The application of the econometric models in this section supports two conclusions. First, a connection needs to be established between banana attri- butes and crop improvement efforts. In that sense, there is a need to link plant breeders, consumers, producers, and decisionmakers. For instance, it is evident in the findings that bunch size matters a lot for both rural and urban respon- dents. Therefore, breeding efforts should concentrate on improving bunch size but without forgetting other quality attributes. Second, increasing the partici- pation of consumers, producers, and producers who happen to be consumers in the decisionmaking process and in marketing chains can help reduce nega- tive perceptions. This is important, not only because of the benefits, but also because of negative responses (such as anti-GM banana campaigns) that failure to include these stakeholders may trigger.

4. How much are consumers willing to pay for the values accruing from GM bananas given a social benefit? How does this willingness compare across different segments of consumers?
Unlike the previous section, where models with interactions and split samples were used to explain heterogeneity of preferences at the individual level, to answer this question we employed a latent class model, which is a more recent model to investigate preference heterogeneity. The latent class model has suc- cessfully identified the sources of heterogeneity at the segment level, unlike the covariance heterogeneity models and random-parameter logit models, which capture heterogeneity at the individual level. Investigation of hetero- geneity at the segment level would be most policy relevant when assessing the welfare impact of the introduction of a technology, such as a GM food prod- uct, on different segments of the population (see, for example, Hu et al. 2004; Kontoleon and Yabe 2006; Birol, Villaba, and Smale 2009). This approach depicts a population as consisting of a finite and identifiable number of seg- ments, or groups of individuals. Preferences are relatively homogeneous within segments but differ substantially from one segment to another. The num-
ber of segments is determined endogenously by the data. The fitting of an individual into a specific segment is probabilistic and depends on the social, demographic, and economic characteristics of the respondents, as well as on their KAPs. Furthermore, respondent characteristics affect choices indirectly through their impact on segment membership.
An increasing number of studies have used this approach to estimate farm- ers’ and consumers’ preferences for various agricultural technologies and food items. For example, Scarpa et al. (2003); Ouma, Abdulai, and Drucker (2007); and Ruto, Garrod, and Scarpa (2008) employed this model for the valuation of livestock attributes. Hu et al. (2004); Owen, Louviere, and Clark (2005); and Kontoleon and Yabe (2006) used it to investigate consumer preferences for GM food. And Birol, Villaba, and Smale (2009) used it to examine farmer preferences for agrobiodiversity conservation and GM maize adoption.
This analysis involved, first, testing further whether preferences of urban households differ from those expressed by rural households. Second, this study included welfare benefits for producers as one of the attributes. Producer benefits often have not been considered in studies on consumer preferences regarding GM food, and we expect these to have a positive effect on consumers’ preferences, similar to the results reported by Loureiro and Bugbee (2005) and Gaskell et al. (2006). The theoretical approach for investigating preference heterogeneity using the latent class model is briefly

118 CHAPTER 4
summarized in Appendix 4C; a detailed explanation and empirical results are reported in Kikulwe et al. (2011).
The findings show that there is significant heterogeneity in consumer pref- erences in our sample. The analysis identified two distinct segments of banana consumers, the potential GM banana consumers (representing 58 percent of the sample and residing more often in rural areas), and the potential GM banana opponents (representing 42 percent of the sample, with the majority found in urban areas). GM bananas are valued the most by poorer households who are located in the rural areas of the Eastern region, where banana pests and dis- eases are prevalent. These consumers are also younger and have positive opin- ions regarding the benefits of GM food and crops. They have larger families and are less often employed off-farm, and they have relatively lower monthly incomes. They would be willing to pay larger premiums for GM bananas
and to ensure producers of bananas derive higher benefits (Table 4.4). The empirical findings support Edmeades and Smale (2006), who argue that cli- ents of GM banana-planting materials are likely to be the poorer, subsistence- oriented households in regions greatly affected by biotic pressures. These results are also consistent with results for the second and third research ques- tions. The utility of the potential GM banana opponents’ segment, mainly rep- resenting urban consumers, decreases with the introduction of a GM banana, which generates benefits to producers. These consumers would therefore be willing to accept a discount for both GM bananas and benefits to produc- ers. Most of these consumers are older and better off; they reside mainly in

urban areas of the Southwestern and Central regions, and mostly associate the GM banana with risks (that is, food, environmental, and health risks). The total WTP among those who gain (the potential GM banana consumers) from the introduction of the GM technology is greater than the total WTP among those who lose (the potential GM banana opponents) due to this tech- nology. The findings suggest that the gainers (the majority of whom are rural consumers) can potentially compensate the potential GM banana opponents (mostly urban consumers) if a GM banana is introduced in Uganda, which
is in accordance with the Hicksian compensation criterion ( Just, Hueth, and Schmitz 2004).
The latent class econometric analysis supports several conclusions related to the introduction of GM bananas in Uganda. First, findings confirm that GM bananas could be a potentially pro-poor biotechnology, and their intro- duction would mostly benefit rural households who grow and buy bananas. Second, we find support for Paarlberg’s (2008) argument that negative atti- tudes of urban elites in African countries can be explained by their views on GM food being closer to the European viewpoint versus that of the rural peo- ple in their own country. Our empirical findings suggest that better educated people are on average more strongly opposed to GM bananas, which holds not only in urban areas but also in rural ones. Third, rural consumers are willing to pay a higher premium for producer benefits compared to their urban counter- parts, suggesting a significant difference between urban and rural consumers’ preferences regarding producer benefits. But findings indicate that stressing the potential benefits the technology may provide to farmers is more likely to increase the opposition toward the GM banana among the urban consumers. Based on the preferences of the various groups of stakeholders, the introduc- tion of GM bananas would be desirable for Ugandan society as a whole, and would merit policy support, albeit with consideration of compensation mech- anisms aimed at smoothing the gains and losses of benefits. Finally, the main lesson learned is that if preference heterogeneity of consumers is not consid- ered, then the results are likely to be biased. Therefore, for studies that seek to explore consumer preferences, heterogeneity is the primary hypothesis. This has implications for study design, scope, and selection of best practices for evaluation purposes.
5. What are the impacts of introducing GM bananas on food security in Uganda? What implications does introduction have for biosafety regula- tions in general?

120 CHAPTER 4
The empirical findings estimated to answer questions 1, 2, and 4 are inte- grated in an economic welfare analysis to provide an overall assessment of the effects of introducing GM bananas on aggregate welfare. The MISTICs asso- ciated with the immediate introduction of a GM banana were compared with the estimated WTP values for the GM banana for different scenarios. We applied the concept of compensating surplus to consumers’ preferences for a GM banana, and conducted simulations based on different combinations of impacts associated with GM-banana-introduction strategies to estimate the consumers’ welfare measures, as presented in Appendix 4D (and explained
in detail in Kikulwe 2010). Welfare measures were estimated for the best-
fit latent class model (see question 4).
The findings showed that there are respondents who gain and those who lose from the introduction of a GM banana, which is consistent with results in the previous section. The total welfare for those who gain (potential GM banana consumers) is greater than the total welfare for those who lose (poten- tial GM banana opponents) (Table 4.5).
The potential GM banana consumers, who are mostly located in rural areas, acknowledged much higher willingness to pay for all the proposed GM banana

alternatives, particularly a GM banana which is characterized by large bunches and large benefits to producers. With this finding, it is evident that benefits to producers played a significant role in the valuation of the banana bunch attri- butes. These results imply that if a GM technology can improve crop produc- tivity (and hence increase incomes of the rural subsistence households), that technology would be easily accepted among the rural population segment. Nonetheless, when the potential GM banana opponents’ households are consid- ered further, their total WTP for the proposed banana improvement scenarios were greater than their estimated average MISTICs per bunch (see Figure 4.2). Based on this finding, we could argue that, on the one hand, the potential GM banana opponents are likely to pay more than the threshold value of not hav- ing a GM banana introduced in Uganda. On the other hand, the calculated

122 CHAPTER 4
MISTICs per bunch for the potential GM banana opponents’ households were generally low, ranging approximately between US$0.15 and US$0.36. Thus,
if the government is to address the concerns of the potential GM banana oppo- nents, it will not exceed the potential forgone benefits (US$200) estimated when addressing question 1. There will be still enough to compensate for the negative effects if a fungus-resistant GM banana is introduced. The aggre-
gate welfare showed improvement in welfare over status quo for all scenarios, which is highest when a GM banana with large bunches and medium benefits is proposed. Thus, if a fungus-resistant GM banana with such attributes is now introduced, its introduction may result in strong opposition from the poten- tial GM banana opponents’ segment of the population, which is composed of mainly urban consumers.
Based on the empirical findings discussed in this section, the follow-
ing conclusions can be derived. First, the GM banana technology is likely to improve overall welfare in Uganda, but we need to think carefully about those who may lose from the introduction of this technology. Thinking about this beforehand can reduce the loss. But the big question is how do we maximize the benefits and reduce cost and risk? Second, a comprehensive cost–benefit analysis, using different approaches, would be of great importance for assess- ing the potential benefits and costs of introducing new technologies—such as GM bananas. The net social costs or benefits of most GM crops are likely to be crop-specific, especially in terms of food and environmental safety issues. Introduction strategies would need to consider the distribution of potential costs, benefits, and risk for these new GM crops before a decision to introduce them is made.
Policy Implications
The findings in this chapter demonstrate several implications for different stakeholders in the banana industry in Uganda, and in Africa in general. First, the calculation of the MISTICs considers explicitly possible long-term effects of GM bananas. The results indicate that with each year of delay in the intro- duction of a GM banana, Uganda loses between about US$179 million and US$365 million. The MISTICs are about US$176 million or more. Only if the real average annual irreversible costs of planting a GM banana would be as high, or higher than, the irreversible benefits, should the release be delayed. We have found no evidence yet that this will be the case. Given the poten-
tial and significant economic benefits from the introduction of a GM banana,

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 123
one might conclude that NARO has to work harder to push the GM banana through the biosafety protocols as promptly and efficiently as possible.
Findings have revealed that government policies delaying the introduction of GM bananas are more in line with the views of wealthier and better edu- cated citizens, the elites, than with the views of the majority of the population. Although this is a disturbing observation—as mainly rural households eco- nomically gain from the introduction of a GM banana—a careful approach toward introducing a GM banana is needed to avoid strong urban consumer resistance. In that case, knowing who will be affected by the new innovations is fundamental in foretelling aggregate benefits.
The findings have further shown that the introduction of GM bananas could be beneficial for Ugandan society as a whole and would merit policy support, albeit with consideration of compensation mechanisms aimed at transferring some of the benefits from gainers to losers. Some methods of com- pensation might be providing more and reliable information about the safety of the technology, which could be channeled through (in addition to the cur- rent institutions) local authorities and extension workers. The findings show that there is a high level of awareness and trust in local leaders and extension workers and scant knowledge of UNCST and Consumer Education Trust, the two main agencies responsible for informing consumers about GM food. This finding suggests an opportunity for informing consumers about GM food through local leaders and extension workers. We would recommend instead
of UNCST and the Consumer Education Trust informing consumers directly that they use part of their resources for training local leaders and enlisting their help in spreading information. This strategy would help offset the negative KAP toward GM technology, especially among urban consumers.
The approach used here highlights how one can evaluate the socio- economic aspects of GM crops in general, linking both the consumers
and adopters of the technology. We have also indicated how one can con- sider long-term irreversible effects and assess consumer attitudes about GM crops. Empirical research along the lines of the methodology followed in this study can be adapted to new GM crops requiring biosafety assessments prior to commercialization. Such research can help overcome one of the problems of establishing a biosafety system in Uganda and in other developing coun- tries. In particular, NARO may institutionalize the approach suggested in this study and build a system that allows for conducting similar analyses of other GM crops—such as Bt cotton currently undergoing environmental and food safety assessments.

124 CHAPTER 4
Finally, there is a need to broaden the scope of biosafety processes (now pri- marily focused on risk) to include food security considerations and agricultural development. This calls for more funding for R&amp;D. Findings have revealed that if a technology has tangible benefits that could improve the incomes of subsistence farmers, that technology could find its way easily to the end users. However, the research agencies that can develop such technologies are finan- cially constrained. For instance, NARO, the main agricultural research agency, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the agricultural research bud- get in Uganda (ASTI 2002), has received less budget share for fiscal year (FY) 2011/12. That is, the budget for agricultural R&amp;D funded by the government of Uganda has decreased from 12.6 percent of the total agriculture budget in FY2008/2009 to 11.8 percent in FY2011/2012. Similarly, the donor funding for agricultural R&amp;D through NARO has also decreased from 30.0 percent of the total agriculture budget in FY2008/2009 to 17.3 percent in FY2011/12 (GOU 2009, 2012). Yet modern biotechnology was embraced as one of the priority areas targeted by the government to increase incomes and improve the quality of life of poor subsistence farmers through increased productivity and increased share of marketed production (OPM 2005). Our study shows addi- tional financial resources are needed for informing potential opponents about the benefits of the technology, as otherwise resources spent might be wasted.
Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research
The choice experiment approach used to collect data for the model simula- tions involved mainly the use of surveys of relevant decisionmakers. It involved collection of data from both producers as consumers (who are the likely poten- tial adopters) and those consumers of bananas who do not produce them. The choice modeling technique follows a Lancaster utility approach for analyzing relative importance of product attributes within a relevant product-choice set. However, stated preference approaches are subject to various criticisms. The most important limitation of the choice experiment noted by List and Gallet (2001), akin to other stated preference methods, is that little may be gener- ated from a hypothetical market about the real market behaviors as a result of disparities between hypothetical and actual statements. However, this issue has been addressed by numerous economists in the literature. For example, List, Sinha, and Taylor (2006) compared choice experiments with hypotheti- cal and real situations. In their experiment, the authors informed respondents about the hypothetical bias problem through “cheap talk” and reminded the respondents to take care when making their choices. The authors found no

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 125
statistically significant differences between hypothetical and real willingness to pay or when estimating the marginal values of attributes. As a result, in our study respondents were informed about the ongoing biotechnological inno- vations in Uganda using brochures prior to the interviews. They were also reminded that there were no right or wrong answers, and that they should consider their choices carefully. In addition, Lancaster (1966) recommended that to determine the product attribute, it is very important to contact the potential consumers directly. In our study informal interviews with consum- ers, such as focus group discussions, were used to develop and design the ques- tionnaire, which was later pretested on both rural and urban consumers prior to primary data collection. With a view to the caveats discussed, the findings support Edmeades and Smale (2006)—who used a revealed preference tech- nique to predict the demand of GM banana-planting materials. However, an empirical investigation comparing hypothetical and real market situations may be warranted.
In the empirical analysis of SIRBs, the data for nonprivate net benefits were not available in the public domain. Hence, the SIRBs were estimated based
on private net benefits. Furthermore, when estimating the MISTICs, we did not include the transaction costs that might be involved between the tech- nology developers and the end users, including R&amp;D costs, compliance with biosafety regulatory costs, and technology fees.8 Such costs can be substantial and are one of the major obstacles to technology dissemination in develop-
ing countries such as Uganda (Brenner 2004). The problem is not limited to GM technology but includes embodied technologies in general. Adding such costs will reduce the SIRBs. Again, they should on average not be more than the SIRBs per hectare, and should be even less if biosafety regulatory costs at the farm level are added. Another limitation of the study is that the MISTICs calculated were generally for Uganda as a country; however, they are likely to vary by region and even by cultivar. Edmeades (2003) notes the diversity of banana cultivars is high at the country, village, and household levels. On aver- age, 23 different banana cultivars are grown at the village level across Uganda, with approximately 5 different cultivars of cooking bananas grown per house- hold. Households located at high elevations, such as the Southwestern region, were found to grow more cultivars compared to those at low elevations (for example, the Central region and most parts of the Eastern region). Thus, MISTICs may be larger for regions (or households) where banana production
8 As technology fees charged by innovators are used to recover R&amp;D and biosafety costs, it is imperative to include such costs as net costs to society to avoid double-counting.
 
126 CHAPTER 4
is high compared to those with low banana production. These issues necessi- tate future empirical research.
Finally, the findings reported in this chapter have shed light on the differ- ences between the urban and rural consumers’ preferences regarding banana bunch attributes. However, future research is required to understand in more detail why urban consumers as well as rural and urban elites derive disutility from GM bananas and the associated benefits for producers. In addition, more empirical research is needed to find more mechanisms through which those who gain may compensate those who lose in case GM bananas are introduced.
APPENDIX 4A: MISTICs
We begin with the assumption that incremental reversible net benefits follow a continuous-time, continuous-state process with trend, where GM crops may be released at a point in time. In this approach, the social incremental revers- ible benefits W * (or SIRBs; the symbol * indicates optimal timing) need to be greater than the difference between the social incremental irreversible costs (I ) and the social incremental irreversible benefits (R), weighted by the size of the uncertainty and flexibility (or hurdle rate) associated with the introduction
of the new technology. The hurdle rate is commonly expressed in the form β/(β – 1), where β &gt; 1 captures the uncertainty and flexibility effect and is a result of identifying the profit-maximizing decision rule under irreversibility, uncertainty, and flexibility, if benefits do follow a geometric Brownian motion. The geometric Brownian motion is a Wiener process with a geometric trend, for which changes expressed as natural logarithms are normally distributed. The Wiener process is a continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic Markov process with three properties: (1) probability distributions of future values depend on the current value only, (2) the Wiener process grows at indepen- dent increments, and (3) changes are normally distributed. The assumption that the adoption of this technology follows a geometric Brownian motion accounts for the uncertainty of the technology (Cox and Miller 1965). The interpretation of the decision rule for the case of a GM banana is that, as long
as W – β (I – R) ≤ 0, Uganda should delay adoption of a GM banana until β– 1
more information about the new technology is available.
In the context of GM crops, where people are more concerned about
the not-so-well-known irreversible costs of the technology, it is feasible to estimate threshold values that indicate the maximum incremental social irre- versible costs that an individual or society in general is willing to tolerate
 
BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 127
as compensation for the benefits of the technology. Scatasta, Wesseler, and Demont (2006) have called this threshold value the MISTIC (I *). In the spe- cific case of Uganda, the estimated MISTICs can be interpreted as the maxi- mum willingness to pay (WTP) for not having the GM banana approved for planting in the country. Actual incremental irreversible social costs (I) are to be no greater than the sum of incremental irreversible social benefits and incre- mental reversible social net benefits for introducing a GM banana, such that
I &lt; I* = W + R. (4A.1) β/(β – 1)
The estimation of the MISTICs (I *) requires quantification of three factors: SIRBs from GM crops (W ); the social incremental irreversible benefits (R) rate; and the hurdle rate, β/(β − 1). All these factors can be estimated or cal- culated using econometric and mathematical modeling techniques following Demont, Wesseler, and Tollens (2004).
We computed the SIRBs at time t (SIRB(t)) as the SIRBs at com-
plete adoption multiplied by the adoption rate at time t ( ρ(t)) and multi- plied by the exponential factor of the expected growth (or drift) at rate α: SIRB(t) ∙ ρ(t) ∙ e α t. The discounted sum of SIRBs (SIRBPV) for Uganda over time is calculated as
SIRBPV = ∫∙ SIRB(t)e –(μ–α)tdt, (4A.2) 0
where μ is the risk-adjusted discount rate, and α is the drift rate of the geo- metric Brownian motion, explained in more detail in Kikulwe, Wesseler, and Falck-Zepeda (2008).
We also tried to identify the social incremental irreversible benefits on
a per hectare basis using information provided by Bagamba (2007). Most banana producers in Uganda do not use pesticides or fungicides to manage pests and diseases, as mentioned earlier. A small proportion (less than a quar- ter) of banana producers applies small amounts of pesticides.
The different hurdle rates, β/(β – 1), were calculated defining β as follows (see Dixit and Pindyck 1994, 147–152):
1 r – δ 3r – δ 142 2r
β = 2 − σ2 + ! σ2 − 2 + σ2 &gt; 1, (4A.3)
where r is the risk-free rate of return; δ is the convenience yield defined as the difference between the risk-adjusted discount rate μ and the drift rate α (that is, δ = μ – α &gt; 0, μ ≥ r); and α and σ2 (variance rate) as before. The maximum

likelihood estimators for α and σ 2 were estimated following Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997).
In our analysis, we limit ourselves to the private incremental revers-
ible benefits at the farm level, assuming all the rents from the new technol- ogy are captured by farmers. In the longer run, the rents will be distributed among farmers, the agents in the banana supply chain, and banana consumers. Additional secondary benefits, such as improved food security and reduced vulnerability to external shocks, may be generated through higher farm income among banana growers. Assessing such benefits would require the use of a general equilibrium model for Uganda and are beyond the scope of this study. Thus, the computed SIRBs are equal to the private incremental revers- ible benefits.
APPENDIX 4B: The Random Parameter Model
An RPLM, or a mixed logit model, is a model that accounts for prefer-
ence heterogeneity by using a random parameter component to the vector of coefficients (βs). The RPLM does not require the independence-of- irrelevant-alternatives (IIA) assumption. It can also account for unobserved, unconditional heterogeneity in preferences across respondents, even when conditional heterogeneity has been considered, as well as correlation among choices arising from the repetition of choices by the same respondent (McFadden and Train 2000; Garrod, Scarpa, and Willis 2002). The random utility function in the RPLM is given by
Uij = V(Zj(β + ηi)) + e(Zj). (4B.1)
The utility is decomposed into a deterministic component V and an error com- ponent stochastic term e. Indirect utility is assumed to be a function of the choice attributes Zj, with the utility parameter vector β, which due to prefer- ence heterogeneity may vary across respondents by a random component ηi. By specifying the distribution of the error terms e and ηi, the probability of choos- ing j in each of the choice sets can be derived (Train 1998). By accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, the random parameter logit model takes the form
Pij = exp(V(Zj(β + ηi))) . (4B.2) Ch=1 exp(V(Zh(β = ηi)))
 
BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 129
Because this model is not restricted by the IIA assumption, the stochastic part of utility may be correlated among alternatives and across the sequence of choices using the common influence of ηi. Treating preference parameters as random variables requires estimation by simulated maximum likelihood. The maximum likelihood algorithm searches for a solution by simulating k draws from distributions with given means and standard deviations. Probabilities are calculated by integrating the joint simulated distribution.
Even though unobserved heterogeneity can be accounted for in the RPLM, this model fails to explain the sources of heterogeneity (Boxall
and Adamowicz 2002). One solution to detecting the sources of hetero- geneity while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity could be to include interactions of respondent-specific household characteristics with choice- specific attributes in the utility function. The RPLM with interactions can detect preference variation in terms of the unconditional heterogeneity of tastes (random heterogeneity) and individual characteristics (conditional heterogeneity), so improving the fit of the model (Revelt and Train 1998; Morey and Rossmann 2003).
When the interaction terms are included in the utility function, the indirect utility function that is estimated becomes (Rolfe, Bennett, and Louviere 2000)
Vij =β+β1Z1 +β2Z2 +...+βnZn +δ1(Z1S1)+δ2(Z2S2)+...+δl(ZnSm). (4B.3)
In this specification, m is the number of respondent-specific characteristics that explain the choice of a banana bunch, and δ1 to δ2 is the l-dimensional matrix of coefficients corresponding to the vector of interaction terms S that influence utility. Because respondent-specific characteristics are constant across choice occasions for any given respondent, respondent characteristics only enter as interaction terms with the banana bunch attributes.
Empirically, equation 4B.3 was then extended to include the 42 interac- tions between the six banana bunch attributes and the seven respondent- specific characteristics:
Vij = β + β1(ZBUNMED) + β2(ZBUNLAR) + β3(ZBENMED) + β4(ZBENLAR)
+ β5(ZGMTEC) + β6(ZPRICE) + δ1(ZBUNMED × SHHSIZE)
+ δ2(ZBUNLAR × SHHSIZE) + . . . + δ42(ZPRICE × SSWEST), (4B.3 ́)

130 CHAPTER 4
where β refers to the alternative specific constant (ASC), which was set equal to 1 if either option A or B was chosen and 0 if the respondent chooses the status quo (option C) (Louviere et al. 2000),9 ZBUNMED is the medium bunch size, ZBUNLAR the large bunch size, ZBENMED the medium benefit, ZBENLAR the large benefit, ZGMTEC GM biotechnology, and ZPRICE the percentage price change. Based on the correlation matrices and variance inflation factors (VIF)10 results, seven consumer characteristics were retained and interacted with the five banana attributes levels to investigate the possible sources of heterogeneity. The selected consumer characteristics included: (1) household size (HHSIZE); (2) whether or not the respondent had postsecondary edu- cation (EDUC); (3) log of household monthly income (INCOME); (4) age
of the respondent (AGE); (5) whether or not the household grows bananas (GROW); (6) whether or not the household was found in the Eastern region (EAST); and (7) whether or not the household was found in the Southwestern region (SWEST).
APPENDIX 4C: The Latent Class Model
The latent class model (LCM) casts heterogeneity as a discrete distribution by using a specification based on the concept of endogenous (or latent) pref- erence segmentation (Wedel and Kamakura 2000). The approach describes a population as consisting of a finite and identifiable number of groups of indi- viduals called segments. Preferences are relatively homogeneous within seg- ments but differ substantially across segments. The number of segments is determined endogenously by the data. The insertion of an individual into
a specific segment is probabilistic and depends on the characteristics of the respondents. In the model, respondent characteristics indirectly affect the choices through their impact on segment membership.
In the LCM used here (see Kikulwe et al. 2011), the utility that consumer i, who belongs to a particular segment s, derives from choosing banana bunch alternative j P C can be written as
Uij/s = βs Xij + εij/s , (4C.1)
9 A fairly more negative and significant ASC indicates a higher tendency of the respondent to
choose the status quo. 1 2 2
10 VIF for each regression is calculated as VIF = 1 – R2 , where R is the R of the artificial
regression with the ith independent variable as a “dependent” variable. Independent variables which exhibited VIF &gt; 5 are eliminated, indicating that they are affected by multicollinearity (Maddala 2001).
  
BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 131
where Xij is a vector of attributes associated with banana bunch alterna-
tive j of a choice set C and consumer i, and βs is a segment-specific vector of taste parameters. The differences in βs vectors enable this approach to cap- ture the heterogeneity in banana bunch attribute preferences across segments. Assuming that the error terms are identically and independently distributed (IID) and follow a Type I distribution, the probability Pij/s of alternative j being chosen by the ith individual in segment s is then given by
Pij/s = exp(βsXij) . (4C.2) C exp(βsXih)
h=1
A membership likelihood function M* is introduced to classify the con- sumer into one of the S finite number of latent segments with some probabil- ity, Pis. The membership likelihood function for consumer i and segment s is given by M*is = λsZi + ξis, where Z represents the observed characteristics of the household, λk(k = 1, 2, . . ., S) is the segment-specific parameters to be esti- mated, and ξis is the error term. Assuming that the error terms in the consumer membership likelihood function are IID across consumers and segments and follow a Type 1 distribution, the probability that consumer i belongs to seg- ment s can be expressed as
Pis = exp(λsXi) . (4C.3) S exp(λkXi)
k=1
The segment-specific parameters λk denote the contributions of the various consumer characteristics to the probability of segment membership, Pis. A pos- itive (negative) and significant λ implies that the associated consumer charac- teristic, Zi, increases (decreases) the probability that the consumer i belongs to segment s. Pis sums to one across the S latent segments, where 0 ≤ Pis ≤ 1.
By bringing equations 4C.2 and 4C.3 together, we can construct a mixed- logit model that simultaneously accounts for banana bunch choice and seg- ment membership. The joint unconditional probability of individual i belonging to segment s and choosing banana bunch alternative j can be given by
  Pijs = (Pij/s) × (Pis) = exp(βs Xij) exp(λs Xi) 4. (4C.4)
3C exp(βs Xih)43S exp(λk Xi) h=1 k=1
  
132 CHAPTER 4
The two models (appendixes 4B and 4C) used have advantages and dis- advantages. The RPLM and LCM, though they both focus on the deter- ministic component of utility, capture heterogeneity differently. The RPLM captures heterogeneity at the individual level, but it assumes the distribution of taste preferences across the population. The LCM is less flexible (that is, the attribute and variable parameters in each segment are fixed), but it allows explaining preference heterogeneity across segments of a given population. In our data set we used both approaches, but we later applied statistical meth- ods to choose which approach fits our data best (for model comparison, see Colombo, Hanlay, and Louviere 2009).
APPENDIX 4D: Compensating Surplus Welfare Analysis
The best-fit LCM,11 which is used to group the population into homogeneous segments, was employed to estimate the required parameters for welfare mea- sures. The LCM allows us to calculate WTP welfare measures for each respon- dent in a segment. Deriving welfare measures under the LCM is done in two steps. First, policy impacts at the segment level are identified by calculating WTP welfare measures for each segment. Second, the standard aggregate pro- cedure that assumes homogeneous preference is corrected for heterogeneity. That is done by computing the weighted sum of segment-specific welfare mea- sures. The weights are the estimated individual segment membership probabil- ities (Boxall and Adamowicz 2002). The individual segment WTP can finally be aggregated to calculate WTP welfare measures for the whole population.
The compensating surplus (CS) welfare measure for changes in the banana bunch attributes, conditional on the segment membership, can be derived from the estimated parameters by using the following equation (Bateman et al. 2003):
  11
C S n = Θ 1 3 l n  e V 1i – l n  e V 0i 4 , ( 4 D . 1 ) price iPC iPC
Following Colombo, Hanlay, and Louviere (2009), a comparison between RPLM with interac- tions (rural sample) and LCM results into a probability of P ≤ Φ(–37.20) ù 0 and that for RPLM with interactions (urban sample) and LCM gives P ≤ Φ(–26.55) ù 0. That is, for RPLM with interactions for urban (K2 = 16) and LCM (K1 = 19), ρ2 – ρ12 = 0.198, while for RPLM with inter- actions for rural (K2 = 18) and LCM, ρ2 – ρ12 = 0.207. This indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected; hence the LCM is preferred. These results show that the preference heterogeneity in our data is better accounted for at the segment level rather than at the individual level.

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 133
where the compensating surplus CSn is the amount of money that one would have to give the individual n after the change has occurred for that person to remain as well off as before (that is, after choosing alternative i in the choice set C ); Θprice is the marginal utility of money and is the coefficient of the banana bunch price attribute; V 0i represents the individual’s utility at the initial level (that is, the current state: banana bunches bred through traditional biotech- nology); and V 1i is the utility of the alternative level (that is, after change state: bunches bred by GM biotechnology) following changes in attributes.
The final marginal WTP welfare measure can be derived by first integrat- ing the welfare effects across the different segments,
C S n | s = Θ 1 3 l n  e V 1i – l n  e V 0i 4 , ( 4 D . 2 ) prices iPC iPC
where s = 1, 2 is the number of segments, and Θprice is the coefficient on the banana bunch price attribute for each segment providing each segment’s mar- ginal utility of income; and then by calculating the weighted sum of the seg- ment membership:
2 H13 1 04J
C S nt | s =  W n s Θ l n  e V i – l n  e V i , ( 4 D . 3 )
iPC prices iPC iPC
where Wns is the probability of an individual n being in segment s.
To estimate the consumers’ compensating surplus (CS), conditional
on being in segment 1 or 2, for introduction of a GM banana over the sta-
tus quo, four possible options were created. The creation of the four policy- relevant scenarios was based on the banana bunch profiles. The attribute levels that characterize a number of alternative banana bunch improvements scenar- ios are listed below, along with the base case:
• Base case (small bunches with no benefits)—status quo: this is the baseline situation where banana bunches consumed are mostly of small bunch sizes, produced through traditional biotechnology. The price for the base case is at UGX 3000 for a 10-kilogram bunch.
• Scenario 1 (all medium improvement): medium banana bunch size pro- duced by GM biotechnology that generates medium benefits (in the form of increased yields) for producers.
• Scenario 2 (all large improvement): large banana bunch size produced by GM biotechnology that generates large benefits for producers.

CHAPTER 4
• •
Scenario 3 (large bunch with medium benefits): large banana bunch size produced by GM biotechnology that generates medium benefits for producers.
Scenario 4 (medium bunch with large benefits): medium banana bunch size produced by GM biotechnology that generates large benefits for producers.
To find the CS associated with each of the above scenarios, the difference between the welfare measures under status quo and the four banana bunch options was calculated.
For the consumer segment that was found to have negative WTP (the potential GM banana opponents), the next step was to find out whether their negative WTP was below or above the MISTICs. We compared the MISTICs per bunch with the estimated total WTP per bunch. To calculate the MISTICs per bunch, we divided the annual MISTICs per household by the average number of bunches consumed per household. Using a per capita con- sumption of cooking bananas in Uganda of 250 kg per year (NARO 2001),
an average bunch size of 10 kilograms (baseline), and an average household size of the potential GM banana opponents of 5.67 members per household (estimated under research question 4; see Kikulwe et al. 2011), and dividing the annual consumption with the average bunch size resulted in an average
per capita consumption of 25 bunches per year. The product of the per cap- ita bunches consumed and household size yielded an average of approximately 142 bunches consumed per household per year. Dividing the MISTICs per household by the number of bunches consumed per household and year after deducting the planting costs provided the MISTICs per bunch.

Chapter 5
Genetically Modified Organisms, Exports, and Regional Integration in Africa
David Wafula and Guillaume Gruère
As noted in the introduction to this volume, genetically modified (GM) crops have been characterized by high adoption rates and a steady increase in global market value. However, their rapid diffusion has triggered a diversity of concerns, including issues related to the safety of the technology to human health and the environment, socioeconomic consid- erations, and issues of ownership and control. Trade-related impacts and access to export markets are increasingly emerging as another major concern. Destinations such as the European Union (EU), where the level of caution and consumer scepticism is relatively high, have attracted a lot of attention (see, for example, Gruère 2006; Paarlberg 2009).
More specifically, several African countries have been preoccupied with the notion that adoption of GM crops would attract a blanket rejection of agri- cultural exports by importing countries in the Western world, especially by European countries (see, for example, Gruère and Sengupta 2009; Paarlberg 2009). The dilemma in policymaking circles has been how to harness the potential benefits of GM crops while preserving trade interests and niche markets (Anderson and Jackson 2005). Although some countries have taken precautionary stances, others have decided to take a “wait and see” stance (Gruère 2006). The potential economic risk for these countries of taking con- servative GM-free policy positions is that they may deny farmers the oppor- tunity to harness and maximize the potential benefits of the technology. By focusing on avoiding any potential future export risks with Europe or other developed nations, these countries may have filtered out nonrisky but benefi- cial technology.
At the same time, little attention has been accorded to the intraregional trade dimension, which is increasingly becoming fundamental (Diao et al. 2005). Intraregional trade in future commercialized products is going to be an issue that may affect trade and the entire regional integration efforts unless biosafety regulatory mechanisms are put in place to address them.

144 CHAPTER 5
This chapter reviews results from the literature to discuss issues of GM product use, export risk management, and regional integration in Africa. The next section focuses on possible export risks associated with the use of GM crops outside of the region, and the subsequent section discusses the increas- ing role of regional harmonization schemes. The chapter concludes with some policy lessons.
Implications for Exports of Commercializing GM Crops
Agriculture is the economic pillar of most African countries south of the Sahara. About 70 percent of the population in most African countries is rurally based and depends on agriculture as a source of income and livelihood. In this regard, efforts related to the promotion of agricultural productivity have been placed at the top of Africa’s integration priorities and processes. The agricultural sector in the region is facing many challenges, including produc- tion constraints at the farm level. In exploring a range of technological options that can supplement conventional tools, the potential of agricultural biotech- nology has been recognized, even though reservations and resistance from some quarters still prevail ( Juma and Serageldin 2007). The issue of possi-
ble market-access barriers in key export destinations has been an issue of para- mount concern. However, the magnitude of the anticipated or perceived risks remains to be analyzed and understood in concrete terms.
Three types of approaches have been used in the literature, all directly or indirectly assessing export risks with the adoption of GM crops in specific countries or regions of Africa: qualitative case study analysis linking actors along the commodity chain, bilateral trade data analysis to assess the possi-
ble commercial risk, and quantitative economic simulations with trade mod- els under specific scenarios. We review the main results of these three types of studies in the following sections. At the same time, we also discuss the key lim- itations of each of these approaches.
Case Study Approach
Although several publications discuss the influence of exports on African decisions (for example, Paarlberg 2009; Gruère and Takeshima 2012), to our knowledge, only one paper uses a case study approach to systematically analyze their nature and implications. Gruère and Sengupta (2009) provide a review of international cases where GM-free private standards set up by supermarkets or other buyers in developed countries have affected biosafety decisions, includ- ing commercialization in developing countries.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 145
Because their analysis is qualitative and partially relies on secondary data from news clips and media reports that are not always accurate, the evidence may not be fully substantiated. Furthermore, even when based on primary data, the data do not allow measuring the scope or significance of the issues and their precise roles in influencing decisionmaking. The analysis simply points toward reports of influential links between trading actors and decision- makers in the area of biosafety.
Gruère and Sengupta (2009) find 29 cases in which export concerns influ- enced biosafety decisionmaking in 21 countries. They then classify these cases into three categories: cases where the alleged export risks associated with a spe- cific decision on GM crops are largely unfounded or irrational, cases where the export risks and policy decisions are debatable, and cases where decisions are supported by real commercial risks.
Interestingly, Gruère and Sengupta (2009) note that Africa south of
the Sahara is the region where the most cases with irrational risks are being reported. Although 11 of the 29 cases are in the first category, 7 of those were reported from Africa. Of the 13 cases related to Africa, 10 are in the first or second categories.
Several cases relate to cash crops. It is traditionally known that African countries have been leading exporters of cash crop commodities, including tea, coffee, cocoa, pyrethrum, sugar, tobacco, bananas, and a wide range of horti- cultural products to various destinations around the world. GM varieties for these traditional exports have yet to be developed, and the situation in Africa is unlikely to drive any commercial interest in releasing GM varieties of these crops. This being the case, there are unrealistic and unjustified requirements from some of the export destinations.
For instance, Gruère and Sengupta (2009) report that GM-free certifica- tion is required for exports of tea from Kenya to the United Kingdom, even though it is widely known that GM tea has not been developed or commer- cialized anywhere in the world. The product development pathway for genet- ically modified organisms (GMOs) shows that it takes about 10 years for a product to pass through the various regulatory steps before it is placed on the market. Development of GMOs also requires a massive capital and research- intensive investment (Sinai 2001).
They also find reports of organic producer groups in Kenya believing that producing GM field crops would jeopardize their exports of horticul- tural products. The Kenya Organic Association Network fears that intro- duction of GM varieties of maize or cotton would affect market access for horticultural products that are organically produced. Yet the possibilities

146 CHAPTER 5
of gene-flow contamination from maize or cotton to horticultural products cannot occur, because the products are not biologically compatible (Gruère and Sengupta 2009).
These and other cases provide qualitative evidence of possible irratio-
nal decisions in the presence of possible but unproven export risks in African countries. Gruère and Sengupta (2009) attribute this phenomenon to four factors: insufficient knowledge and information on the part of decisionmakers compared to influential agents, risk aversion, and misleading presumptions
on the existence of GM open markets and the possibility of segregating non- GM exports. Regardless of the specific reasons, their findings do shine a light on the strict precautionary behavior of African decisionmakers on biosafety and testing or use of GM crops.
Trade Data Analysis
Going one step beyond case studies, simple bilateral trade data analyses have been used to assess the likelihood of immediate export risk with the intro- duction of a GM crop in a particular country. The principle underlying such studies is that the examination of the composition, destination, and monetary value of commodities exported in past years can help assess the possible short- term trade-related ramifications and market-access barriers that may result from the introduction and commercialization of GM crops in particular coun- tries in Africa.
It should be noted that this approach has a number of critical limitations and does not provide sufficient information to dispel any potential trade risks. Most importantly, it is based on the assumption that past trade data provide
a valid representation of future trade relationships; that is, export destina- tions, trade volume, and value are assumed to remain similar for the period
of study and for the near future. Naturally, this is not an innocuous assump- tion, especially in the case of African countries south of the Sahara, which face a number of productivity and market constraints that may be overcome in the years to come.1 In particular, if a GM crop was able to increase productivity,
it might result in a net marketable surplus that would face export constraints. Furthermore, the assumption disregards the possibility of new trade flows from countries that do not export any potentially GM commodity to Europe and other GM-regulating countries (zero trade). Clearly, the lack of trade today does not mean there is no risk to trade in the future.
1 For instance, Juma (2010) argues that Africa has the means to become self-sufficient and even be able to export commodities in the near future.
 
GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 147
Still, even accounting for uncertainties, analyzing recent trade data can help discriminate cases that represent immediate or short-run export risks from others based on discourse rather than data. As noted in the previous section, some reported cases have linked seemingly irrational commercial risks to reg- ulatory decisions. Finding that a country has a large trade relationship with
a GM-regulating country is useful for managing risks and avoiding immediate export losses. For instance, Thailand and Vietnam, aware of the importance of non-GM rice preferences of major importers, decided to ban any experi- ment on GM rice to avoid any possible export loss (Gruère and Sengupta 2009). The presence of past trade with large importing countries that regulate or avoid GM food, although not necessarily predicting the future, provides useful information for decisionmakers.2
With these caveats in mind, an influential economic analysis was con- ducted on the trade implications of GMOs in Africa under the aegis of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) (Paarlberg et al. 2006). The Regional Approach to Biotechnology and Biosafety Policy in Eastern and Southern Africa project was initiated to address concerns that transboundary movement of GMOs in the COMESA region might impact trade among member states unless a regional policy mechanism was put in place to mitigate such eventualities. The project covered six case study coun- tries: Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.
The study analyzed the short-run trade ramifications of introducing and commercializing GMOs that are available globally under recent trade flows to current markets. The magnitude of potential immediate trade losses, based on 2003 bilateral trade data, was illustrated by examining the total value of agricultural commodity exports and the proportion of this export value that risks being rejected in market destinations that treat GM com- modities with sensitivity (either due to regulations or buyers’ preferences). That GMOs can affect trade cannot be disputed. Consignments of agricul- tural exports originating from a country that has commercialized GMOs are treated with suspicion and are generally expected to contain GMOs, even in cases where such consignments contain only GM-free products. The Regional Approach to Biotechnology and Biosafety Policy in Eastern and Southern Africa study computed the potential value of conventional agri- cultural food and feed products exported to various destinations from the six case study countries in 2003. The proportion that is likely to be rejected
2 Moreover, given the political realities, short-run considerations are much more powerful in the eyes of decisionmakers than long-term potential issues.
 
148 CHAPTER 5
because of GM sensitivity was ascertained and expressed as a percentage of the total agricultural food and feeds exported.
The share of the past exports that are GM-sensitive commodities con- sists of agricultural commodities whose GM counterparts have been approved globally for commercial planting. They include soybeans, maize, cotton, canola, squash, rice, papaya, tomatoes, and Irish potatoes.
The worst-case scenario of the analysis assumed that if the six targeted COMESA countries commercialized the aforementioned products, all exports of food and feed products associated with the crops in question (second col- umn of Table 5.1) would be rejected by all importing destinations world- wide. Naturally, this assumption is exaggerated, given that many countries
do not regulate imports of GM products and even those that do—including European countries—import large volumes of approved GM products. The findings revealed that the proportion of exports immediately at risk would be 8.5 percent for Egypt, 2.2 percent for Ethiopia, 1.1 percent for Kenya, 6.2 per- cent for Tanzania, 6.5 percent for Uganda, and 6.3 percent for Zambia.
Assuming that only the EU would reject the exports, the level of immediate risk for Egypt would be about 4 percent and the rest of the countries 1 percent or less, as shown in Table 5.2 (Paarlberg et al. 2006).
This low level of immediate trading risk exposure stems from the fact that most of the potential GM commodities go to other African countries. Thus, continental and regional demand largely exceeds external demand for the selected products. Although this result does not preclude the possibility that

Trade Simulations
Several research publications have focused on modeling the economic effects of GM crop adoption in the presence of trade restrictions in developed coun- tries (see Smale et al. 2009). Most of these papers studied the effects of adop- tion at the global or regional level, and only a few focused on the effects in Africa. Almost all of these papers used a computable general equilibrium model to simulate the effect of adoption or nonadoption of GM crops in spe- cific regions or throughout Africa south of the Sahara.
Although these simulations provide an improved, more detailed, and more structured representation of trade and economic effects, they also face a num- ber of limitations, notably because of their structure and the database they
are based on. In particular, they are based on several key assumptions, includ- ing the use of known and stable productivity shock and adoption rates in each country of production, masking the variability among producers, production practices (input use), regions, and years; a perfectly competitive world market; and a specific reference year. Their value is to provide some insight into the potential economywide effects of the use of GM crops in the region, based on specified assumptions.
In this category, several studies focused on the effects of adopting GM cot- ton (for example, Elbehri and MacDonald 2004; Anderson and Valenzuela 2007), a commodity that does not face any trade regulation (ICAC 2010),

150 CHAPTER 5
but whose adoption is found to be necessary in a globally competitive market. Assuming it is productivity enhancing, and knowing that all major countries have adopted GM cotton, there is a significant opportunity cost of nonadop- tion of GM cotton for countries in the region (Bouët and Gruère 2011).
In the case of GM food and feed crops, Anderson and Jackson (2005) use
a global general equilibrium model to simulate scenarios of adoption with a focus on Africa south of the Sahara. Their results show that GM crops gener- ate positive welfare gains to African countries south of the Sahara. The study also shows that welfare gains associated with adoption of GM crops outweigh the gains tied to greater market access in restrictive export destinations, such as the EU. The estimated gains would be slightly lower if the EU’s policies con- tinue to effectively restrict imports of affected crop products from countries that decide to adopt GMOs in Africa (Anderson and Jackson 2005).
These results are generally consistent with one of the other papers in the literature, and they do not seem to depend too much on the crop studied or the adoption level. Because of the low trade flows and the fact that the gains of GM crops are mostly captured domestically, African countries are found to gain regardless of regulatory barriers.
Yet at the same time, a few of these papers focus on potential trade impli- cations within Africa. Anderson and Jackson (2005) is the exception. It shows that a GM ban in countries of the Southern African Development Community to save rents from exports to Europe results in lower gains than would be obtained by GM crop adoption.3 Still, regional restrictions can matter, as shown by recent developments in South Africa. Some countries in southern Africa have adopted (transitional or seemingly established) strict import policies on GM food. This did not prevent South Africa from success- fully adopting and marketing GM maize in the past (Gruère and Sengupta 2010), but the situation changed in 2010 with an unexpectedly large harvest, leading to excessive marketable surplus. The combination of high GM maize adoption and the continued presence of GM import barriers in the region resulted in large domestic stocks that traders have had trouble selling, despite a significant maize shortage in parts of East Africa. As a result, the South African maize price dropped, while Kenya and other countries had to pur- chase high premium non-GM maize for imports.
This contrasting example underlines the role of regional integration, which is the subject of the following section.
3 Langyintuo and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2006) study the trade effect of differential adoption of a GM cowpea in various countries of West Africa, but they do not model regulatory barriers.
 
GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 151
The Case for Regional Integration
The Biotechnology Revolution and Regional Integration
Regional integration is a process in which states enter into a regional agree- ment to enhance cooperation through regional institutions and rules. Its objectives can range from economic to political, although it has become a political economy initiative where commercial purposes are the means to achieve broader sociopolitical and security objectives. Efforts at regional inte- gration have often focused on removing barriers to free trade in the region, increasing the free movement of people, labor, goods, and capital across national borders. This works as a spur to greater efficiency, productivity gain, and competitiveness, not just by lowering border barriers, but also by reducing other costs and risks of trade and investment.
In numerous forums, African leaders have underscored the importance of greater coordination and harmonization among the continent’s many regional economic communities. For instance, the most important of these efforts are the Abuja Treaty establishing the African Economic Community and the more recent Constitutive Act of the African Union. Article 3 of the Act of the African Union underscores the need to “coordinate and harmonize the poli- cies between the existing and future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment of the objectives of the Union” (AUC 2011). The New Partnership for Africa’s Development, which is one of the core programs of the African Union, assigns a significant role to the regional economic communi- ties, emphasizes regional and subregional approaches, and encourages African countries to pool resources to enhance growth prospects and to build and maintain international competitiveness (UNECA 2006).
According to the COMESA secretariat, creation of a Customs Union has increased trade from US$9 billion in 2007 to US$15.2 billion in 2008. To sus- tain the positive trend, regulating trade in products that contain or may con- tain GMOs and transboundary movements of GMOs across porous borders
is going to be a fundamental element. It is on these grounds that African lead- ers have demonstrated political will and commitment to cooperate and take a common approach to biotechnology and biosafety issues at the regional level.
High-level meetings have been held to discuss matters touching on harmo- nization of biosafety standards. Deliberations at the Extraordinary Conference of the African Ministers Council on Science and Technology, held in Cairo in November 2006, focused on the African Strategy on Biosafety. The Strategy targets the national and subregional levels for planned interventions to be

152 CHAPTER 5
undertaken by the African Union and its member states to ensure harmony in policies concerning modern biotechnology and biosafety. The Strategy rec- ognizes efforts that the Regional Economic Communities have exerted in
the area of biosafety or interlinking trade and biosafety. These initiatives will be used to complement the efforts of the Union. The Conference of African Union Ministers of Agriculture, held in Libreville, Gabon, from November 27 to December 1, 2006, deliberated on An African Position on GMOs in Agriculture (AU 2006). The ministers recommended that the African Union set up mechanisms to identify commonalities among the Regional Economic Communities to be used to harmonize and coordinate policies on biosafety and biotechnology. Developments in regional harmonization are now con- spicuous in the COMESA region, the Economic Community of West African States, and the Southern African Development Community.
Implications of Commercializing GMOs for Intraregional Trade in Africa
Currently, three African countries have granted approvals for commercial release of GMOs. South Africa has been growing insect-resistant (Bt) cotton, Bt maize, and GM soya for more than a decade. Burkina Faso and Egypt com- mercialized Bt cotton and Bt maize, respectively, in 2008.
The importance of such commodities as cotton and maize has been rec- ognized in the region by such bodies as COMESA and the East African Community (EAC). Maize is a principal food-security commodity that dom- inates both formal and informal trade, especially in eastern and southern Africa. In 2007, the size of the regional maize market (EAC and COMESA) was estimated to be slightly more than US$1 billion. The total maize con- sumption in the region is about 16 million metric tons per year (Njukia 2006). The EAC development strategy for 2001–05 advocated liberaliza- tion of maize trade. COMESA, in collaboration with EAC and the Regional Agricultural Trade Expansion Support, has been exploring options for foster- ing regional maize trade. One of the strategies embraced is a “maize without borders” concept involving harmonized policies and regulatory frameworks to facilitate increased movement of maize across borders (COMESA 2003).
Efforts to promote trade in cotton in the COMESA and EAC regions have also been noted. In 2005, the first Regional Cotton and Textile Executive Summit was held in Nairobi, Kenya. The meeting resulted in the formation of the Africa Cotton &amp; Textile Industries Federation (ACTIF) in the same year. It is a regional body composed of the cotton, textile, and apparel sectors from across Africa south of the Sahara aimed at creating a unified and recognized

GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 153
voice in both regional and global trade affairs. ACTIF was officially launched on March 28, 2010.4
As evidenced by profiles of various commodities in the recent past (ICTSD and ATPS 2007), exports of crops for which biotech varieties could potentially be introduced and commercialized in Africa are largely destined
to other African countries. This is a strong indication that African countries should be more concerned about possible commercial export risks associated with intraregional trade. For instance, less than 5 percent of maize produced in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda is exported outside Africa. The share of maize traded intraregionally (that is, within Africa) is 98 percent for Kenya, 96 per- cent for Tanzania, and 99 percent for Uganda (ICTSD and ATPS 2007).
As borders are porous and effective mechanisms and infrastructure for monitoring transboundary movement of GMOs are often absent, Bt maize and Bt cotton can easily be shipped from one country to another either for- mally or informally. If Kenya commercialized Bt maize and Bt cotton ahead of Tanzania and Uganda, for instance, the chances of trade disputes erupting are high unless biosafety regulatory instruments are put in place to address trans- boundary movement of such commodities.
As mentioned earlier, Regional Economic Communities in Africa are push- ing for increased regional integration and free-trade areas. However, with some countries moving ahead with the commercialization of GMOs and others considering adoption of a GM-free stance, the unrestricted and rapid move- ment of such commodities as maize may not be realized. At the national level, several countries have provisions for handling imports, exports, or GMOs
in transit in their policies, laws, or regulations. However, it is important that such biosafety considerations are adequately incorporated into instruments of regional economic integration to safeguard disruption of intraregional trade. In the absence of mutually acceptable regional policies and guidelines, some countries may decide to go for stringent identification, testing, and labeling procedures. This would drastically slow down smooth cross-border flow of essential commodities. The costs of biosafety regulation could also increase the price of food in the importing countries.
Conclusions
In this chapter we discussed export risks associated with the use of GM crops in African countries. Several African countries have adopted a precautionary

154 CHAPTER 5
posture, to the point of imposing bans on adoption of GM crops, in an attempt to maintain access to target export markets (particularly countries in Europe) that prefer non-GM products. Yet our review of case studies, trade data, and simulation analyses suggests that most of the alleged risks are lim- ited, especially when compared to the potential benefit of adopting GM crop technology.
Although each of these study approaches has clear limitations, their results indicate that the presence of an immediate risk of export loss has been exag- gerated. In particular, an analysis of commodities produced and exported
from African countries indicates that the magnitude of short-run commercial export risk in destinations outside Africa would be relatively small in monetary terms, because current GM crops (like maize) are largely traded intraregion- ally. Agricultural exports to the EU, Asia, and the Middle East are tradition- ally of cash crops or horticultural products, such as tea, coffee, vegetables,
and flowers.
Still, because the results of these analyses are based on existing patterns of
trade, and trade patterns may change (or have the potential to change with cer- tain policies and investments), the consideration of the export consequences of allowing and expanding GM crops may differ across countries and would need to be assessed specifically for each country, depending on its circumstances and agricultural potential.
The example of South Africa is particularly telling; it was considered a suc- cessful importer and exporter of GM and non-GM maize in the past (Gruère and Sengupta 2010). But after an unexpectedly high GM maize harvest in 2010, it faced the problem of oversupply with insufficient foreign demand, driving domestic prices down, notably because of the import bans on GM products in the region.5
Thus, countries should carefully weigh the potential risks of losing export earnings on a case-by-case basis. Reluctance to approve beneficial GM crops, especially those that could deliver large welfare gains, is likely to deny farmers in the region the opportunity to harness the diverse benefits of GM crops and products. But rapid approval of highly traded GM commodities in the pres- ence of foreign regulations and low excess demand may also prove detrimental, leading to price depression.
5 After government efforts to find external buyers, in 2011/12, South Africa faced the reverse prob- lem of excessive external demand, forcing South African animal feed manufacturers to purchase maize from other countries at a higher price than the domestic price.
 
GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 155
The importance of current intraregional trade in GM-sensitive commodi- ties implies that trade disputes could also erupt—especially if some countries reject imports of agricultural commodities on the grounds that they could be contaminated with GM products. This would impact negatively on current efforts to facilitate unrestricted movement of commodities, such as the “maize without borders” concept and customs union arrangements that have been concluded or are being negotiated.
Thus, regional cooperation in matters related to the transboundary move- ment of GMOs is bound to be of great importance. Bilateral and multilateral mechanisms to manage intraregional trade in products that may contain GMOs is required to ensure that the goals of regional integration are not jeopardized. Biosafety considerations should be adequately incorporated in regional integration instruments.

Chapter 6
Estimates and Implications of the Costs of Compliance with Biosafety Regulations for African Agriculture
José Falck-Zepeda and Patricia Zambrano
As noted in the introduction to this volume, the area planted to geneti- cally engineered (GE) crops has increased in developed and develop- ing countries since their commercial approval in 1996 ( James 2011). In Africa three countries, Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa, have approved the commercial cultivation of GE crops. Regulatory systems in other African countries have approved the deployment of laboratory/greenhouse experi- ments and confined field trials for the development of more technologies.
In addition, several developed and developing countries have made research and development (R&amp;D) investments in crops and traits of local interest
as a reaction to the observed benefits realized from GE crop cultivation in other countries (Atanassov et al. 2004). Yet public-sector research in develop- ing countries, including in Africa, has released very few products to farmers, even though no damage to human health or the environment has been docu- mented for any of the GE crops that have been approved and commercialized to date. This significant record is endorsed by science academies in Europe and the United States, international agencies, and national and regional regulatory agencies.
Two of the most pressing questions for Africa’s national R&amp;D systems and the International Agricultural Research Centers working in Africa are why
so few GM products have made it to farmers and why there is such a limited number of crops, trait choices, and geographical locations for the release of potentially valuable technologies.
One answer may be that compliance with national biosafety regulations has increased the cost, time, and effort required for the approval of these technolo- gies in African as well as in other countries. Increased costs may be negatively affecting research efforts to develop suitable and locally adapted technolo-
gies for developing countries (Kent 2004; Wright and Pardey 2006). Costs can be seriously increased when regulators are pressured to take into account concerns not necessarily related to the safety release of a product. For specific
 159

environments, valid safety questions might be raised regarding the effect of certain crops and traits. A solid regulatory system should be able to sort these valid concerns from those that are not needed to demonstrate safety.
As with any other innovation, conducting R&amp;D to develop GE crops and releasing them to farmers is a long and costly investment project. Compared to conventional technologies, GE crops can carry higher R&amp;D and technology transfer costs, but their stream of benefits over time can substantially offset these initial costs. Having a regulatory system that can operate in a timely and efficient way will guarantee that these benefits are not affected by unnecessary time delays, which is the single most important factor affecting benefit.
We structure this chapter as follows: first, we examine background bio- safety issues related to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; second, we dis- cuss the estimation of the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations; third, we present estimates for the cost of compliance in selected countries, including those developed for the African context; fourth, we discuss the implications for national research systems in Africa and elsewhere; and finally, we provide some concluding comments.
Background on Biosafety Issues
The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety does not explicitly define the term bio- safety.1 This situation is not unusual in international agreements, as there may not be sufficient consensus for an explicit definition in a multilateral con- text. The lack of definition leaves space for parties to the Protocol to define biosafety in their own legislation. Here we propose a functional definition of biosafety that considers the processes implemented within the scope of a regu- latory system that enables a robust risk analysis of modern biotechnologies to ensure their safe use. Box 6.1 contains other biosafety definitions. Biosafety in this sense is a principle that evaluates the adoption of a new technology with careful consideration of its potential effects on the environment and human/ animal health. This definition is very broad and acknowledges the lack of
a unique “best” approach to biosafety analysis (McLean et al. 2002). Each country bases its biosafety system on its own national, environmental, politi- cal, financial, and scientific capacities. The latter magnifies the importance
1 The Protocol does specify the scope in Article 4: “This Protocol shall apply to the transbound- ary movement, transit, handling and use of all living modified organisms that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health” (SCBD 2000, 5).

 BOX 6.1 Other Definitions of Biosafety
Convention on Biological Diversity—Biosafety Unit
Biosafety is a term used to describe efforts to reduce and eliminate the potential risks resulting from biotechnology and its products. For the pur- poses of the Biosafety Protocol, this is based on the precautionary approach, whereby the lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as an excuse to postpone action when there is a threat of serious or irreversible damage (see “What is the precautionary approach?”). While developed countries that are
at the center of the global biotechnology industry have established domestic biosafety regimes, many developing countries are only now starting to estab- lish their own national systems. [www.cbd.int/biosafety/faq/]
Ecolomics International
The concept of biosafety as it is used under the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety specifies those legal actions that an importing country is enti-
tled to take under international environmental law with the aim of protect- ing the biological diversity of its conventional plants and animals against the risk of contamination through imported varieties or species consisting of so- called Living Modified Organisms. These actions consist primarily of preven- tive or precautionary trade measures. Such restrictions or bans include the elaboration, negotiation and implementation of pertinent standards, and the institutionalization and international harmonization of the related regulatory framework and procedures. They also take into consideration the legally less clearly circumscribed concerns over related public health issues and socio- economic considerations. All these provisions aim at a non-hierarchical and mutually supportive relationship with other international agreements, espe- cially with WTO [World Trade Organization] law, with the Codex Alimentarius, and with the International Plant Protection Convention. [www.ecolomics- international.org/headg_biosafety.htm]
of framing biosafety within each country’s context as well as that of defining global principles of risk analysis and regulatory experiences.
In most countries with a biosafety system in place, regulators and policy- makers base their current biosafety assessments on past experience with risk analysis. These procedures provide a systematic and ideally science-based foun- dation that society can expand to address multiple consumer and other stake- holders’ concerns and conflicting issues deemed important by society. Several countries, particularly those which signed and ratified the Cartagena Protocol, enacted regulations for assessing, managing, and communicating the risk

assessment and subsequent decisionmaking for genetically modified crops (Mendoza 2005). A functional biosafety regulation system may have signifi- cant benefits for society and should ensure that the “right” technologies make it to market, while discarding those technologies that do not work or do not meet society’s safety standard.
Most biosafety regulatory processes consist of a sequence of steps that require advance review and regulatory approvals by some combination of insti- tutional, regional, or national biosafety committees. In Figure 6.1 we present an example of the typical steps taken for a biosafety assessment as part of a GE product development process. A typical sequence of steps may include labora- tory trials, glasshouse/greenhouse (contained) trials, confined field trials, step- up (extended) field trials, and commercialization, although many variations of the sequence presented in Figure 6.1 exist.
The linear sequence of events in Figure 6.1 considers the possibility that each step builds on the accumulated knowledge in previous regulatory steps or on the generation of additional knowledge submitted to regulatory authorities. Biosafety regulators examine application dossiers submitted by the proponent considering the parent crop, the transformation method, the gene construct, and the GM crop for health and environmental impact. All activities conducted dur- ing the regulatory approval phase incur a cost. Therefore, proponents need to include biosafety regulatory costs in total development costs.
Risk and cost considerations bound biosafety assessments and biotechnol- ogy decisionmaking processes (Viscusi, Vernon, and Harrington 2000). The tensions among safety, technology use, and cost translate to trade-offs among

ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 163
these competing issues. In terms of risk, society has a maximum level of risk that it is willing to tolerate while using innovations. In turn, the decisionmak- ing process is confined by cost considerations because of limited budgets for biosafety and biotechnology review processes. Policymakers may describe pol- icy options through risk and cost combinations offering society the same level of risk at a lower cost or the same level of cost but with a lower level of risk. These trade-offs highlight the need for societies to define a decisionmaking path that will guide their actions.
The idea that risk, benefits, and cost trade-offs need to be examined during the design and implementation phases of biosafety and biotechnology regula- tory processes is conceptually elegant and simple. However, actual risk assess- ment and eventual approval or rejection of a particular biotechnology is a complicated process. The safety profile of particular GE technologies consists of a portfolio of risk factors, each of which has a safety profile that may require its own decisionmaking process. For example, when examining food/feed safety, biosafety assessors may examine risk factors, such as allergenicity or tox- icity, whereas when examining environmental safety, they may consider impact on non-target organisms.
The multifactor characteristic of the biosafety profiles of most GE technol- ogies is further complicated as there may be different weights placed on each factor based on individual or institutional preferences. Regulators may deem the risk of one specific factor as unacceptable, whereas regulators may deem other risk factors as acceptable or manageable by risk-mitigation efforts. The multifactor characteristic of most GE technologies makes the cost–benefit and risk assessment much more difficult in practice.
Estimating the Cost of Compliance with Biosafety Regulations
Table 6.1 presents the four categories by which economists usually classify the social costs of regulations. These costs are listed in relative order of estimation from easiest to hardest. As an alternative, regulatory costs can be disaggregated into variable and fixed costs. Fixed costs are those that do not vary with the activity level of the research or production activity. In contrast, variable costs change with the level of activity. Regulations that impose high fixed costs on research institutions will hurt public-sector institutions (and small private firms), as they impose a higher per unit cost of research activity. Compared to private institutions, the public sector usually has more restrictive or less flexible budgets. Therefore, regulators need to consider “economies of scale” effects when designing and deploying biosafety regulations.

Although it is worth considering all potential costs of implementing bio- safety regulations, some costs are relatively easy to conceptualize but very
hard to quantify in practice. For example, the cost of rejecting projects that have potential social benefit will be difficult to measure. There are also other types of social costs that policymakers and regulators need to consider, such
as transitional, social welfare, or indirect costs, which are also difficult to esti- mate. An example would be the opportunity costs of Institutional Biosafety Committees and National Biosafety Committees. What is important to take into account is the need to acknowledge that regulatory design and implemen- tation has social costs and that there are trade-offs between innovation and regulatory intensity, especially if regulators move beyond what is needed to demonstrate safety.
Estimates of the Cost of Compliance with Biosafety Regulations
A handful of studies has documented the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations for a diverse set of countries and commodities. The cost evaluation used in many of the studies, particularly in developing countries with evolv- ing regulatory frameworks, is mostly of an ex ante type. Hence, these studies derive the project costs of compliance from “best guess” estimates. For the ex post studies, the data collection approach considers those activities earmarked as biosafety regulatory costs by the developer. The biosafety regulatory costs in the studies presented here focus on the real-resource compliance costs and do

not include other social costs, like government-sector regulatory costs, social welfare losses, and transitional and indirect costs.
The Insect-Resistant Maize for Africa Project in Kenya
A decade ago the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center and the Kenyan Agriculture Research Institute, with the support of what today
is known as Syngenta Foundation, launched the Insect-Resistant Maize for Africa (IRMA) project. The objective of the IRMA project was to develop through conventional and genetic-engineering methods maize varieties that are resistant to stem borers, a major pest in Kenya and other African countries south of the Sahara. In Kenya alone, estimates of this pest damage on maize production are approximately 14 percent, equivalent to 79 million US dollars (US$) (De Groote et al. 2004).
At the time of the project launch, biosafety regulations were only start- ing to take shape in Kenya. In 1998, a year before the launch of the IRMA project, the National Council for Science and Technology issued Regulations and Guidelines for Biosafety in Biotechnology and established the National Biosafety Committee (NBC), which is responsible for reviewing applications and setting guidelines for the Institutional Biosafety Committee.
In February 2000, scientists from the project submitted to the National Biosafety Committee their first application to import from Mexico leaf tissue from first-generation International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center events to screen their effectiveness against stem borers in Kenya. This required previous visits and inspections from the Kenyan Plant Health Inspectorate and the National Biosafety Committee (now known as the National Biosafety Authority of Kenya). Given that biosafety regulations were just starting to be put in place, it is not surprising that this application took more than a year
to process (Mugo et al. 2005). After this learning experience, as illustrated in Table 6.2, the cost of these applications dropped substantially, and the process- ing time decreased over the years.
During the first 6 years, the project remained in the contained stage. The estimated costs of this stage were close to 1 million US dollars (US$), as detailed in Table 6.3. The IRMA project continues its activities to date with a renewed focus on conventional approaches to incorporating insect resis- tance to borers. The IRMA project has been a learning process for regulators and scientists in Kenya, who have become familiarized with a biosafety assess- ment process (Mugo et al. 2011). The project has opened the doors to other GE crops that national regulators have reviewed since the original biosafety

Scientists estimate that the African bollworm is the most damaging pest for cotton, and its control accounts for 30 percent of production costs, with yield losses that can reach up to 100 percent (AATF 2006; Waturu 2006). The Kenyan Agriculture Research Institute has been actively working on the introduction of insect-resistant (Bt) cotton varieties since 2001, and the first confined field trials started in 2006. Table 6.4 pre- sents the estimates for the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations for Bt cotton in Kenya. Cost estimates in the case of Kenya add up to approximately US$772,000.
Fungus-Resistant Bananas in Uganda
The National Research Organisation (NARO) of Uganda launched a joint project with the Agricultural Biotechnology Support Program II and the University of Leuven, Belgium, to develop a black Sigatoka–resistant banana for the Ugandan context. The GE option is part of a broader effort launched by NARO to develop bananas resistant not only to black Sigatoka but also to bac- terial blights, nematodes, and other severe productivity constraints for Ugandan agriculture by pursuing conventional and biotechnology means. The black Sigatoka–resistant product entered a confined field trial in 2008, approved by the National Biosafety Committee, under the supervision of NARO.
Table 6.5 includes an estimate of the potential costs of compliance with biosafety regulations for the case of black Sigatoka–resistant bananas in Uganda.3 These costs are similar to those for a nematode-resistant vari-

ety in Uganda. Estimated costs through the confined field trials add up to approximately US$1 million. These estimates do not include the commer- cialization approval or the scale-up necessary to transfer the technology to farmers.
Costs for the black Sigatoka event are expected to be somewhat high com- pared to other events, due in part to the uniqueness of the event. There are very few instances of regulatory reviews of bananas and of fungal (or bacterial blight / nematode-resistance) traits. Nevertheless, if we compare the estimated costs stemming from regulations and R&amp;D to the potential gains from the technology (see Chapter 4), we can affirm that it is prudent to assess properly

this technology in order to enable the transfer of a safe and much-needed tech- nology to farmers.
Estimates from Other Countries
Table 6.6 summarizes earlier estimates of regulatory compliance costs from dif- ferent sources. Regulatory compliance costs varied across commodities and countries, ranging from US$500,000 for Bt cotton in India to US$4 million for soybeans in Brazil. These initial estimates of the costs of compliance with biosafety regulations were made based on the existing regulatory process at
the time of data collection. In some cases, these estimates are likely to change with changes in the regulatory process; therefore, they need to be updated over time. Regulatory cost estimates in Table 6.6 for technologies in develop- ing countries tend to be lower than the costs incurred by private companies for earlier technologies in the United States, as seen in Table 6.7.
As summarized in Table 6.7, estimates of regulatory costs in the United States in the private sector vary from US$7 million to US$15 million per single new product for first-generation products released into the country (Kalaitzandonakes, Alston, and Bradford 2007). There are several potential

explanations for the difference between the estimates of the cost of compliance presented here. These include cost underreporting by the public sector, lack of experience with earlier events, and the use of information generated in devel- oped countries for use in developing countries. Some of these estimates are subjective and may be a reflection of uncertainties about the regulatory process that may be followed to ensure compliance.
Table 6.8 introduces estimates for the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations in the Philippines and Indonesia. Values presented in this table are for a combination of costs incurred to the time data were being collected in addition to the best estimate of potential costs to completion. Similar to the situation in Table 6.7, the estimates presented in Table 6.8 tend to be low com- pared to other estimates in the literature, in part because these are technolo- gies approved in other countries, and thus developers were able to use—or are expecting to use—data generated elsewhere. Allowing the use of data gener- ated elsewhere helps reduce compliance costs.
The case of Bt maize in the Philippines is different, in part because this technology was one of the first to go through the regulatory approval process in the country. As a result, there was very little regulatory expe- rience with GM crops. Costs in the case of Bt maize are higher, because estimates in Table 6.8 consider the opportunity cost of using the infor- mation generated elsewhere by costing the relative value of maize to the

Philippines vis-à-vis global values (Manalo and Ramon 2007). If we disregard the opportunity costs for knowledge generated elsewhere, then we observe a reduced value comparable to the other crops shown in Table 6.8.
Values presented in Table 6.8 are similar to other estimates by Bayer, Norton, and Falck-Zepeda (2008). Their estimates for the Philippines show that the costs of compliance with biosafety regulations were similar or even larger than the development costs.4
Implications for Agriculture in African and Other Developing Countries
To date, only three countries have approved the commercial release of a GE crop (Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa). Other countries have—or are—conducting confined field trials, including Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Many more countries in Africa are considering developing their biosafety frameworks further to commercialize GE products after a bio- safety assessment. In this section, we describe the potential impact of the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations for African agriculture. Because of the limited experience completing the different stages of a regulatory process that culminates with the potential commercial release of an assessed prod- uct, we rely on experience in other countries and sectors to discuss poten-
tial impacts.
High regulatory costs are especially relevant for regulatory impact assess-
ment and technology decisionmaking efforts when they go beyond what
is needed to demonstrate safety. Certainly, developers may conduct several activities during the regulatory stage that have a specific objective apart from biosafety, including identifying early marketable products or addressing poten- tial liability concerns. Whether any cost is justifiable from a private or social investment standpoint will depend on its net contribution to social welfare. From the standpoint of regulatory impact assessment, concerns include in- efficiencies, duplications, and unnecessary procedures that do not contrib-
ute to regulatory objectives. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify additional activities that yield enhanced safety knowledge but at an increasingly declining rate, as they may not justify more investments. Identifying these costs is para- mount to improving the system.
4 Another study was done by Redenbaugh and McHughen (2004), who report that the cost of com- pliance with biosafety regulations in horticultural crops may be as low as US$1 million per allele but can be as high as US$5 million.
 
ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 173
The high compliance costs observed so far relate to relatively well- described crops and traits, where science has accumulated a large body of knowledge on which to base regulatory assessments. Scientific and regulatory knowledge from these approved GE crops spilled over to other countries, thus reducing the potential cost needed to generate new information for similar or related technologies. Unfortunately, it is likely that current estimates for regu- latory compliance costs represent a lower boundary for the expected costs for new crops and traits that will enter the regulatory pipeline in the near future. Although the opportunity arises of learning from existing regulatory pro- cesses to improve their efficiency, and the cost of performing individual scien- tific assessments may be declining over time, these trends may not be sufficient to balance the expected cost increase for novel products or traits entering the regulatory pipeline. Of course, the ability of knowledge to flow among coun- tries provides a rationale for regional efforts to coordinate or harmonize assess- ments and decisionmaking processes.
Direct Cost Impacts
The high cost of compliance with biosafety regulations can affect public and private crop-improvement investments in different ways. The most obvious outcome is that a high compliance cost may reduce, ceteris paribus, investment in the development of regulated products and thus reduce the flow of poten- tially valuable products reaching farmers. In Africa, the impact of high regu- latory costs may be more relevant to decisionmaking than elsewhere, as the likelihood exists that the regulatory systems in the continent may deal with crops and traits that have high social value in terms of benefits, but there may not be experience with or knowledge about the risk assessment.
These include crops like cassava, sweet potatoes, and bananas; or traits like viral and fungal resistance. However, risk assessment is a process that follows a set of well-defined steps identifying potential risk, likelihoods, and dam- age. This process has been validated through extensive risk-assessment expe- rience not only with GE crops but also with pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other chemicals. The scope then exists for developing robust systems in Africa that will respond to regulatory challenges in direct relation to the level of
risk involved.
A more subtle outcome of high compliance costs is that, compared to unregulated products, public and private organizations may require a higher social/private rate of return for these regulated products as they carry greater R&amp;D risks for developers. This outcome may have the unintended conse- quence of forcing developers to concentrate—and evaluate in more detail the

174 CHAPTER 6
potential impact—on higher return products, but because of budget con- straints, African developers may forgo projects that might have high social returns over time but require a significant level of financial resources up front. Furthermore, high compliance costs may force the public sector with very lim- ited annual budgets to refocus research efforts on unregulated products. In addition, the private (and even the public) sector may concentrate on those commodities with more innate private-return characteristics compared to crops of public interest. Certainly, the private sector focused on just four GE crops for the first generation of products after the marketability of their prod- ucts was affected by regulatory costs and uncertainty.
Time Value of Money
A regulatory process extends the time needed to release a product for com- mercial purposes. Although this outcome is inevitable for regulatory processes, the core issue is to separate those regulatory activities needed to demonstrate safety from those added due to regulatory inefficiencies. Investments made during product conceptualization and R&amp;D usually are done in advance of the regulatory process. Developers need to recuperate these investments as soon as possible because of the customary preference to have a return now rather than later. As time goes by, money itself “loses” its value at a discount rate deter- mined by the time value of money to society or private interests.
Lack of clarity about regulatory requirements, scheduling, and other tim- ing issues; restrictions on coordinating R&amp;D and biosafety activities; limita- tions in terms of regulatory capacity of the competent authority; and other factors can compound the impact of regulatory delays. Delays beyond what would be needed to assess a product defer the onset of the stream of benefits generated through farmer adoption. Although there is very limited experience with assessing such delays in Africa, below we present a summary of studies in Uganda and in the Philippines, which show the critical need for reducing reg- ulatory gaps and the importance of coordination to ensure prompt and effi- cient regulatory processes that deliver safe products.
The study by Kikulwe, Wesseler, and Falck-Zepeda (2008) examined the impact on social benefits from the introduction of a GE black Sigatoka– resistant banana in Uganda (see Chapter 4). This ex ante study incorporates irreversible cost and benefits using the real options approach. Results from this study show that if an approval delay occurs, Uganda forgoes potential social benefits of approximately US$179–365 million per year. Furthermore, assuming a maximum planting area of 541,530 hectares with a GE banana in Uganda, maximum total costs to bring the GE banana to Ugandan producers

ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 175
cannot exceed US$108 million. Otherwise, the GM banana is not a viable alternative. Results from this study show that regulatory delays and the total cost of development are substantial and need to be taken into account.
Figure 6.2 summarizes the results of the study by Bayer, Norton,
and Falck-Zepeda (2008). This study examined the impact of increases in the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations and of regulatory delays on net benefits generated from the potential adoption of Bt eggplant, virus- resistant tomatoes, Bt rice, and virus-resistant papaya in the Philippines. Results showed that increases of up to 400 percent with respect to the

estimated base cost of compliance with biosafety regulations did not affect sig- nificantly the net present value of benefits from potential farmer adoption. In contrast, relatively small regulatory delays of 1–3 years reduced significantly the net present value of benefits from farmer adoption. This effect was espe- cially significant in the case of tomatoes, eggplant, and papaya.
Entry Barriers and Regulatory Uncertainty
Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety have chosen to pursue a bio- safety assessment for GE crops before deliberate release into the environ- ment. Most non-parties have also implemented a biosafety regulatory system based on existing regulations or through new national laws and regulations. Regulations carry financial and time costs that countries need to incur in order to guarantee the safety of their citizens. The problem arises when concerns
not related to safety are added to these regulations, which turns the process into a serious hurdle for technology decisionmaking. In essence, the regula- tory process may increase costs beyond what developers and society consider reasonable. In some cases, the turning point may be achieved when addi- tional investments in biosafety assessments return reduced amounts of addi- tional safety.
Excessively high regulatory compliance costs constitute a barrier to entry, especially for smaller organizations and the public sector when they are high enough to have an impact on investment decisions. This is true especially when organizations face budget constraints. Furthermore, in those coun-
tries where there is high regulatory uncertainty—in terms of not knowing how, if, and when a product may complete a regulatory process—the public and private sectors may reduce their levels of investment as they are less pre- pared to deal with investment uncertainty, which complicates decisionmaking under risk.
In a decisionmaking process under risk, R&amp;D organizations typically contrast the cost of R&amp;D and compliance with the probability of obtain-
ing an approval for commercialization and the potential market returns
from deploying a product; they then make an investment decision based on the risk-weighted returns. In the public sector, the focus is not on profit but rather on social return; thus, these organizations face a similar decisionmak- ing process.5 In contrast, when R&amp;D organization must make decisions under
5 Regulatory costs can also be considered as sunk costs once developers make investments in advance of knowing the outcome. Thus, developers would not factor them into the decisionmak- ing process once the investment is made. This old conundrum relates to whether analysts con- sider costs ex ante or ex post. There is no consensus among economists with regard to this issue.
 
ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 177
uncertainty, the decisionmaking process becomes quite difficult and may represent a binding constraint for organizations examining investment for product development.
Although relatively high investments are needed to conduct biotechnology R&amp;D, the costs appear to be declining significantly over time. In spite of the cost reductions for some activities, initial investments to develop biotechnol- ogy programs continue to be a barrier to entry for smaller organizations and the public sector in Africa and in other developing countries. The same holds for biosafety, as investment costs in buildings, equipment, laboratory capac- ity, and other capital investments can be onerous for developing countries. The pressing need exists to examine whether specific investments in biosafety are actually required to assess safety or the appropriateness of the technology development process, vis-à-vis the current innovation development stage in the country.
There are many strategies to reduce cost without sacrificing safety. Developers and regulators can use information generated in another coun- try (or within the same country) in order to guide the biosafety assessment of a particular event. In addition, the regulatory system may reduce the required information needed by identifying activities that add no value for assessing safety. Assessors may consider identifying specific risk considerations that do not contribute to the risk profile of the technology. Alternatively, develop- ers can conduct some of the more expensive food/feed safety tests in coun- tries where it is less costly. As long as regulations or laws governing the process remain unchanged, costs will decrease as developers and regulators become more experienced and more events go through the regulatory process.
Sources of Funding
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, researchers should not stop their research projects on the basis of the high costs of compliance without taking into con- sideration the relative importance of these estimates to the total cost of devel- opment, the importance of the crop and its trait for national interests, and the estimated level of benefits that may be achieved by using the technology. The latter issue connects with the damage averted or gains made from using the technology. Furthermore, researchers need to take into account how compli- ance costs have changed over time.
In the absence of other considerations, if developers have a high-
value product—especially those in the public sector with significant value for resource-poor farmers—then the relatively high R&amp;D costs (including those for biosafety assessment) have to be contrasted with whether it pays to

178 CHAPTER 6
invest in such technologies and who will pay for it. In other words, if a particu- lar technology demonstrates a real positive public value, then identifying the entity that will pay for bringing this technology to farmers is key in the deci- sionmaking process
Unfortunately, public research budgets face the current declining trends in R&amp;D investments seen not only in Africa but also in other regions. This situ- ation contrasts with the pressing needs that accelerating climate change and additional population pressure will bring to African countries, on top of the existing lags in innovation investment. Although the international research system and some developed countries have expressed their will to support ongoing innovation activities, support has not fully materialized.
Conclusions
Modern biotechnology needs to be a part of the tools used for effective pov- erty alleviation in Africa. As GE crops and other products are regulated products, it is imperative to establish regulatory systems that are commen- surate with the potential risk of the technology. These systems should be not only flexible enough to adapt to gains in knowledge and experience, but also transparent and fair, and take into consideration all aspects of a broad and inclusive decisionmaking process. Biosafety systems that are too cum- bersome or inflexible and those that become an insurmountable hurdle will stop this technology in its tracks, even those that have an elevated potential to resolve specific productivity issues of African agriculture. Biosafety thus becomes a process that considers all costs, benefits, and risks of prospective technologies within the scope of overall sustainable agricultural and eco- nomic development.
So far, GE crops that have been released deliberately have had a remark- able safety record. No proven damage to human health or the environment has been documented for any of the approved GE crops. Science academies
in Europe and the United States, international agencies, and national and regional regulatory agencies officially endorse this safety record. However, novel crops and traits that will enter the regulatory pipeline may present a new set of challenges for regulatory agencies and biosafety systems.
Biosafety regulatory systems assess, manage, and communicate the objective risks posed by GE crops to human health, the environment, and biodiversity. Benefits and costs from the potential introduction of the tech- nology have only received a cursory attention by most regulatory systems.

ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 179
Furthermore, failing to adopt new technologies that may benefit poor farm- ers and consumers carries its own set of risks (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2003). Undesirable conventional agricultural production practices may result in overexposure to chemical pesticides or incomplete abatement of pest damage, negatively affecting food safety and security. Biosafety regula- tory systems thus need to balance objective risks to human health and the environment against the potential risk of opportunity losses to increase agri- cultural production, introduce novel crops, and enhance the livelihoods of poor people.
The key to delivering safe, valuable, and appropriate GE technologies to farmers in poor countries is smart and efficient regulatory systems imple- mentable by countries with lower scientific and financial capacity. Developing countries need such a system, which does not necessarily mean more biosafety regulations. Regulations have to be based on risk-assessment procedures with a history of success in other countries. Many international documents articulate biosafety, risk assessment, and risk management principles; a specific example is Annex III to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Furthermore, establish- ing sensible regulations does not have to be complicated, as long as the process is robust, transparent, and participative ( Jaffe 2006). Most importantly, bio- safety needs to be a process trusted by society. Several policy and regulatory system options are available for improving biosafety processes.
African and other developing countries eventually will need to decide whether biotechnology and GE crops are useful for their development pro- cesses. This decision will be—hopefully—based on information on likely and actual impacts from biotechnology adoption and use (see, for example, Smale et al. 2009). Furthermore, developing countries need to realize that excessively precautionary approaches to biosafety regulations will have an impact on the flow of potentially valuable biotechnologies reaching farmers. All countries have the sovereign right to decide whether to embrace or reject this technol- ogy, but it is desirable that such decisions consider all costs, benefits, and risks involved with this technology. For those countries that are considering adopt- ing GE crops, proper biosafety and technology assessments will help ensure the reduction of the costs and risks while maximizing the benefits.

Policy, Investment, and Partnerships for Agricultural Biotechnology Research in Africa: Emerging Evidence
David J. Spielman and Patricia Zambrano
The past decade has seen vociferous debate over genetically engineered (GE) crops and their potential contribution to Africa’s development. Although the initial debates revolved primarily around whether such technologies should be introduced, recent debates have become far more nuanced. Today, the discourse addresses such questions as what types of public policies can make GE crops and other applications of agricultural biotechnol- ogy (agbiotech) more readily available to researchers, farmers, and consum- ers in Africa. This chapter examines the extent to which public policies across the African continent are enabling the research, development, and dissemina- tion of GE crops. The chapter does so by drawing on data from two studies on issues relating to the design and execution of such policies.
The first section reviews the literature on key issues in agbiotech research, development, and deployment, with specific reference to Africa. The next one describes the two studies on agbiotech in developing countries, with findings from these studies presented in the subsequent section. A set of actionable pol- icy recommendations is then provided, followed by concluding remarks that offer insights to the future of GE crops and agbiotech in, and for, Africa.

The growing body of literature on the state of agbiotech in Africa includes three main areas of inquiry: (1) studies that track the development and com- mercialization of GE crops in the region; (2) studies that follow the devel- opment of biosafety regulations and related legislation for managing the release of GE crops in the region; and (3) studies of the size, types, and con- straints to investment in research, development, and dissemination of GE crops by the public and private sectors. The literature in each of these areas is reviewed here.

184 CHAPTER 7
Tracking the Introduction of GE Crops
The literature that tracks the development and application of GE crops
is highlighted by several key sources. The first and most widely used
source of information is the International Service for the Acquisition
of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a global initiative that publishes peri- odic data and analyses of GE crop adoption worldwide. The information assembled by this initiative, along with its in-depth analyses of key trends and developments at the global, regional, and country levels (see, for example, ISAAA 2009), is possibly the most widely referenced source on these partic- ular topics. A recent ISAAA global overview by James (2011) shows that in 2011, 160 million hectares of land across 29 countries worldwide were under GE crop cultivation, and the number of developing countries that had adopted GE crops totaled 18 (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Honduras, India, Mexico, Myanmar, Pakistan, Paraguay, the Philippines, South Africa, and Uruguay). Of these 18 countries, only 3 were in Africa: Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa. In fact, South Africa was the only African country listed by ISAAA as planting GE crops up until 2008, when Egypt and Burkina Faso joined the list with the commercial- ization of Bt maize and Bt cotton, respectively.
A second source for GE crops is the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations online Database of Biotechnologies in Use in Developing Countries (FAO-BioDeC). This database monitors trends in the develop- ment, adoption, and application of agbiotechs in developing countries (FAO 2011). For crop biotechnology FAO-BioDeC currently lists 3,104 products, of which 1,092 are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a total of 50 countries. For countries in Africa south of the Sahara, only 11 are listed, with a total of 66 GMO crop products (Table 7.1). Most products are listed under South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria.
A third source is the Center for Environmental Risk Assessment (CERA) database, formerly hosted by Agbios, a Canadian initiative that assembled detailed information on the global state of GE crop approvals by specific event (Agbios 2009).1 The latest CERA database provides a list of 144 events that have been approved by national regulatory bodies from 23 countries and the European Union. In line with the data from James (2011), the only countries listed in CERA from Africa south of the Sahara are South Africa and Burkina Faso—South Africa with 25 approved products for cotton, maize, canola

and soybean, and 1 for Burkina Faso with the recently commercialized cotton (CERA 2011).
A fourth source is bEcon, a web-based bibliography maintained by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) of the applied econom- ics literature that documents the impacts of GE crops in developing countries (Yerramareddy and Zambrano 2011). Whereas other sources of information focus primarily on the commercialization of GE crops and the regulatory regimes that promote or impede commercialization, bEcon and an accompany- ing literature by Smale et al. (2009) offer additional insights into the costs and benefits of agbiotech to farmers and consumers.
Analysis from these sources also suggests a mixed record of impact to date. Although James (2011) and others are generally optimistic about the gains from the rapid diffusion of insect-resistant (Bt) cotton and other trait/crop combinations, Smale et al. (2009) offer a mixed report on economic outcomes. They caution that positive findings in terms of cost reductions and yield improvements for Bt cotton in China and India should not be generalized to other traits, crops, and countries, and that more extensive and comprehensive research is needed to better understand the impacts of GE crops in develop- ing countries.

186 CHAPTER 7
Tracking Biosafety Legislation and Regulation
Studies of developments in the field of biosafety legislation and regulation in Africa are generally in-depth examinations on governance issues relating to the research, development, and dissemination of GE crops to researchers, farm- ers, and consumers in Africa. Key studies in this area include Baum, de Kathen, and Ryan (2001); Johanson and Ives (2001); Mugabe (2002); Alhassan (2003); Sithole-Niang, Cohen, and Zambrano (2004); Harsh (2005); Wafula and Clark (2005); and Karembu, Nguthi, and Abdel-Hamid (2009). These studies assess a range of regulatory issues, such as the health and environmen- tal risks of GE crop cultivation, the costs and benefits of agbiotech regulation, transparency and accountability issues in regulating GE crops, and challenges related to capacity strengthening to support the design and implementation of biosafety regulations.
Studies on the broader governance issues, including the political and political economy aspects of agbiotech and their influence on national regulatory systems in Africa (and in other developing countries) are offered by Komen, Webber, and Mignouna (2000); Paarlberg (2001); Cohen and Paarlberg (2004); Cohen (2005); Pray, Bengali, and Ramaswami (2005); and Birner and Linacre (2008), among others. A conclusion that can be drawn from these studies is that timely advancement of agbiotech and GE crop research, and its effective use to address local problems in agriculture, is often hampered in countries where approvals are few and far between, where political interest groups advocate against the design and implementation of agbiotech policies and regulations, or where the capacity of the country’s research and regulatory systems is limited.
Interestingly, although data reported earlier indicate that research and approval of GE crops in Africa is progressing at a sluggish rate, there is evi- dence suggesting that more progress has been made regarding the estab- lishment of functional regulatory frameworks. In 2004, only five countries (Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe) had national bio-
safety policies in place: by 2009, this figure had increased to include Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, and Zimbabwe (Karembu, Nguthi, and Abdel-Hamid 2009). Investment in the development of viable regulatory systems and the capacity to manage them has received a boost from the international community, with sig- nificant flows of resources originating from the US Agency for International Development (though the Program on Biosafety Systems and Agricultural Biotechnology Support Project II), the United Nations Environment Program–Global Environmental Facility, the World Bank, and others.

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 187
Regional initiatives and organizations in Africa—the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research
in Eastern and Central Africa, the Economic Community of West African States, the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development, the Permanent Inter-State Committee for the Fight against Drought in the Sahel, and others—have also played a central role in strength- ening capacity for biosafety regulation and facilitating the regional harmoni- zation of biosafety regulations. These advances have been made in spite of the significant variation in how individual countries frame and execute their bio- safety regulations (Spielman, Cohen, and Zambrano 2006a,b).
Tracking Public and Private Investment in Agbiotech
Studies of the levels, types, and constraints on investment in research, devel- opment, and dissemination of GE crops are a barometer of what is coming through the pipeline for Africa. Studies on public expenditure on agri- cultural research and development (R&amp;D) are particularly useful in this context. Drawing on data from the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators initiative online database, Pardey et al. (2006) find that most African countries faced declining or stagnating growth rates of public invest- ment in agricultural R&amp;D between the 1970s and 1990s. Beintema and Stads (2006), using data from the same database, estimate that the growth rate of public expenditure on agricultural R&amp;D had declined from 2.0 per- cent in the 1970s to only 0.8 percent in the 1990s. Excluding South Africa and Nigeria from their sample—where R&amp;D expenditures grew during the 1990s—total spending in the region actually declined by 0.2 percent per year, resulting in a halving of average spending per scientist (Beintema and Stads 2006). A complementary study by Falck-Zapeda et al. (2003) suggests that R&amp;D specifically related to agbiotech represents a tiny fraction of these figures; it is concentrated primarily in South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt and is often highly dependent on donor funding. More recent evidence from Beintema and Stads (2011) indicates that although public R&amp;D spend-
ing growth has recovered in the region between 2001 and 2008, growth has been concentrated in only a few countries and generally driven by staff salary increases and infrastructure rehabilitation, with little indication of growth in biotechnology investments.
Studies of private investment in the research, development, and dissemi- nation of GE crops are also an important barometer of what is in store for

188 CHAPTER 7
Africa. At the global level, investment in agbiotech research is not insignifi- cant. Estimates suggest that private investment in plant biotechnology by
the leading multinational companies during the mid-1990s totaled approxi- mately 1 billion US dollars (US$) per year, a figure that amounts to roughly half of all global expenditure on agbiotech R&amp;D (Byerlee and Fischer 2001; Pray and Naseem 2003). However, most of these expenditures were concen- trated on crops, traits, and technologies directly relevant to industrialized country farming. Again, only a minute fraction of this expenditure is immedi- ately relevant to Africa, a finding that Spielman (2007) suggests does not bode well for small-scale, resource-poor farmers in the region, although Pingali and Traxler (2002) are more sanguine.
But at a more local level, private investment in agbiotech is defined
and constrained by the effectiveness and efficiency of seed systems and markets—beginning from varietal approval processes and ending with the distribution of improved cultivars to farmers. Functional seed systems are critical, because they are the channel through which many agbiotech appli- cations will be deployed and disseminated in Africa. However, seed systems are, by their nature, subject to a variety of unique market and institutional constraints (Tripp and Louwaars 1997; Gisselquist and Van der Meer 2001; Tripp 2001).
First, problematic property rights result from the fact that improved seeds can, in many cases, be reproduced by the farmer, thus reducing the ability of breeders to appropriate the gains from their innovative activities and invest- ments. Second, information asymmetries result from the inability of farmers to make ex ante assessments of seed quality, because such knowledge is held only by the seller in the absence of certain types of regulation. Third, coor- dination problems result from difficulties of enforcing and monitoring con- tracts for seed use: farmers often save and exchange seed without the breeder’s knowledge. Finally, inelastic supply responses result from the inability of breeders to respond effectively to rapid changes in seed demand from farm- ers: often, farmers may reassess their seed type and quantity requirements just prior to planting based on expectations of rainfall, market prices, and other factors—decisions taken long after breeders have bulked up seed quantities for distribution.
Although seed systems may exist in Africa where markets for a given crop are well developed (for example, maize in Kenya), they are more often weak or otherwise incomplete due to the constraints noted above. Seed systems for “orphan” crops of marginal commercial value but of critical importance to subsistence farming—for example, sorghum, millet, groundnuts, pigeonpea,

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 189
cassava, or sweet potatoes—are rarely functional in the region, primarily because of the combined weakness of the markets for these commodities, the nonappropriability of varietal improvements under current technological and legal regimes, and limited incentives to commercialize public research on vari- etal improvements in most countries (Tripp 2000, 2001). Thus, the market and institutional failures pose a significant barrier to the entry and growth of private seed firms that could potentially commercialize, market, and distrib- ute varietal improvements resulting from public research. This is a major dis- incentive to increasing investment in GE crops and agbiotech research across the region.
One way of potentially bridging these systemic and market failures is to simultaneously draw on the assets and experiences of both the public and pri- vate sectors to develop and deploy GE crops in Africa. Studies by Pray (2001); Dubock (2003); Hall (2005); Spielman and Von Grebmer (2004); Chataway (2005); and Spielman, Hartwich, and von Grebmer (2007, 2010a,b) suggest that public–private partnerships (PPPs)—broadly described as any activity in which public and private entities jointly plan and execute activities with a view to accomplishing mutually agreed-on objectives while sharing the costs, risks, and benefits incurred in the process—represent an innovative approach to promoting agbiotech and GE crop R&amp;D in developing countries.
R&amp;D partnerships rely on processes of knowledge sharing, resource pool- ing, cost minimization, scale economies, and joint learning to generate syner- gies in conducting advanced research, commercializing new technologies, and deploying new products. Ideally, these synergies result in research outcomes of greater quantity; with a greater chance of success; or at lower cost than pub- lic, private, or civil society actors could expect when acting independently.
If the research is strategically focused on the needs of marginalized social groups, outcomes may ultimately translate into significant social and eco- nomic benefits.
Partnerships are particularly useful to larger or more advanced systems that require access to cutting-edge research tools, proprietary knowledge, or other types of information and data; and to smaller systems that do not have the scale economies to conduct independent research efficiently (Byerlee and Fischer 2001). In recognition of this potential, key public-sector actors are engaged in several partnerships focusing on enhancing yields or nutritional content of such crops as rice, wheat, and cassava. In Africa, PPPs include research projects on Bt maize, water-efficient maize, Bt cowpeas, and disease- resistant bananas and plantains (see AATF 2009). PPPs in livestock vaccine development have also played a role in bringing agbiotech to bear on Africa’s

190 CHAPTER 7
development; public–private research networks also exist for cassava and other crops (Smith 2005; Aerni 2006; Spielman 2009).
In many cases, members of the CGIAR Consortium play an important role in convening these projects and networks; mobilizing resources; and con- ducting research in close partnership with national research systems, multi- national crop-science firms, and local seed firms. These projects and networks are expected to deliver beneficial outcomes over the next decade, although it remains unclear to what extent the partnership approach is yielding the antici- pated outcomes.
Data, Data Sources, and Methods
This chapter examines agbiotech and GE crop research using data from two separate studies on agricultural R&amp;D. The studies—each backed by its own survey instrument and data—provide some new evidence on the policy envi- ronments in agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa.
Next Harvest 2002
The first study, titled Next Harvest, was initiated in 2002 by IFPRI and the International Service for National Agricultural Research (see Atanassov et al. 2004). It was conducted to determine expectations and limitations on publicly researched GE crops and traits. The study was conducted based on an expert survey distributed to a purposeful sampling of 76 researchers and regulators working in public organizations in 16 developing countries. The sample was designed to capture the extensive variation in the type and state of research in different countries and organizations, and to ensure that rel- evant knowledge, experiences, and insight were provided to participants. Information on 209 GE crop products under development was received through the year 2003, along with the type of transgenes deployed, tech- niques used to deploy transgenes, types and sources of germplasm used, stage of regulatory approval reached, type of collaboration used to conduct the research, and plans for dissemination of research outputs. Fifty-four of the 209 products (26 percent) were attributable to GE research in African coun- tries (Table 7.2).
Public–Private Partnerships 2006
The second study was undertaken by IFPRI in 2006 to examine partner- ships between private firms and the members of the CGIAR Consortium

(see Spielman, Hartwich, and von Grebmer 2007, 2010a,b). The study
used four specific tools—document analysis of PPP-related materials, semi- structured interviews with key informants engaged in partnership-based proj- ects, an email survey of CGIAR centers, and development of a functional typology of partnerships—to identify and analyze 75 CGIAR partnerships that were active in 2004 (Table 7.3). A total of 12 out of 15 centers responded to the survey and follow-up queries that were focused on the purpose, part- ners, outcomes, duration, and budgets of center PPPs. The survey also used these tools to provide a more in-depth analysis of 6 partnership-based projects at 4 separate CGIAR centers. A total of 14 projects (19 percent of all PPPs) in 5 centers (33 percent of all centers) involved agbiotech in some sense, with half of these partnerships engaging leading crop-science companies in the sector. Only 2 of these agbiotech projects were being conducted in Africa, although the remaining 12 projects covered crops and traits that were also potentially relevant to Africa. The first project is the Insect-Resistant Maize for Africa project undertaken by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Syngenta Foundation, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, and others. The second is the East Coast Fever vaccine development project undertaken by the International Livestock Research Institute, Merial, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, and others.2
2 Since 2006, one new PPP involving agbiotech—the Water-Efficient Maize for Africa project— has been launched. This brings the total number of PPPs in agbiotech research in Africa to three. Other agbiotech PPPs may also exist in the region; however, no new survey has been conducted since 2006 to document them.

Key Findings
Findings from these two studies indicate that even though a growing num- ber of countries in Africa are developing the necessary regulatory systems to support agribiotech research and GE crops, the actual research, development, and deployment of such products is lagging, largely because neither public- nor private-sector resources are being brought to bear in Africa, thus slowing the pace of innovation. These findings confirm those from other studies men- tioned earlier, but they delve somewhat deeper into both the causes and conse- quences. This is examined in detail below.

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 193
Insights from Next Harvest
A key finding of the 2004 Next Harvest study was that public research institu- tions in developing countries have conducted a significant number of diverse crop transformations to express a wide variety of crop groups and transgenes.3 However, although relatively large numbers of products were recorded in Asia and Latin America, the only African countries with any significant number of transformations were Egypt and South Africa. The situation has not changed substantially over the past 5 years, although a few countries have been added to the set of countries developing these technologies.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
When classified by crop type, more than half (55 percent) of all public trans- formations recorded by the Next Harvest study were concentrated among
15 crops that are critical to achieving sustainable food security and reducing poverty in developing countries. The remaining 45 percent of products were focused on cotton, vegetables, and fruits—crops of a more commercial nature. For Africa, the predominant crop group in all 54 products was cereals, fol- lowed by vegetables, roots and tubers, and sugar, with each group representing a fairly diverse set of crop species. The greatest numbers of products among all 11 crops were for maize (17.0 percent), potatoes (13.0 percent), and sugar and tomatoes (11.0 percent each).
With regard to regulatory progress, most of these products remained confined to the experimental stage of laboratory and greenhouse trials; fewer have advanced to later stages in the regulatory process, such as field trials for biosafety testing, scaling-up for wider environmental and efficacy testing; or commercialization for release to farmers. Overall, African coun- tries lagged slightly behind their Asian and Latin American counterparts: whereas 70 percent of all products in the African countries surveyed were still at the experimental stage, only 60 percent were at a similar stage in Asia and Latin America.
MAIN RESEARCH ACTORS
Most of the surveyed public organizations worked in isolation from other research actors, both public and private. In the study, only 7 percent of trans- formation products generated by these organizations were conducted in col- laboration with the private sector, and only 22 percent were generated in
3 Findings based on data from the Next Harvest survey are reported in Atanassov et al. (2004); Sithole-Niang, Cohen, and Zambrano (2004); Cohen (2005); and Spielman, Cohen, and Zambrano (2006a,b). However, the findings presented here update these findings with additional analysis of the data and offer new insights from more recent research.

collaborations between or among public institutions (Table 7.4). In Africa,
the distribution of involvement was somewhat different: half (52 percent) of all transformation products were from a single public institution, whereas the others were from public–private (22.5 percent), public–public (13 percent), or some other type of collaboration (2 percent). Africa also had more represen- tation from the private sector regarding origin of genetic materials. Although only 5 percent of all surveyed transformation products relied on genetic mate- rials derived from local or foreign private-sector materials, 15 percent of all materials used in Africa originated from the private sector.
TRAITS OF GE CROPS
In terms of transgenes and gene groups, the figures suggest that agbiotech and GE crop research may be limited in focus with respect to the particular biotic and abiotic stresses facing agriculture in many developing countries. Fungal, bacterial, and other types of resistance are still at very preliminary stages of research for developing-country crops and agroecologies, whereas herbi-
cide tolerance, insect resistance, and virus resistance—originally designed for the needs of industrialized-country agriculture—continue to dominate the research pipeline.
REGULATORY PROCESSES
In terms of regulatory progress, the figures indicate that forward movement in agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa is limited to very few countries and that research in those countries is only now reaching the initial stages of the regulatory process. Even though agbiotech may shorten the time needed to identify transgenes and transform plants, the resulting GE crop still requires time for scaling up, efficacy trials, environmental testing, and other regulatory
47 15 8 6
 
POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 195
requirements particular to genetic modification. Agbiotech research in Africa has not moved far along this road.
This reality is, according to many survey respondents, worsened by the fact that some countries have subjected GE crops to multiple years of testing— resulting in significant waiting periods for approvals for scale-up or pre- commercial trials—or have only interim guidelines or regulations in place
that do not allow for commercial approvals. Even those countries that do have the ability to evaluate GE crops and provide commercial approvals often lack confidence in their commercial decisionmaking. Others may be facing such limitations as growers’ inability to produce adequate amounts of seed for large- scale or food-safety testing.
PUBLIC- AND PRIVATE-SECTOR INTERACTION
The relatively small role attributable to the private sector in agbiotech and GE crop research in African countries suggests that public–private research collab- orations face significant barriers to implementation. This absence of collabora- tion could pose difficulties for public institutions as they advance crops from research to regulatory approval and commercialization. Without exchanges of valuable regulatory data from private firms and other research institutions that have conducted transformations of similar crops and/or traits in industrialized countries, public institutions are poorly equipped to navigate the regulatory and commercialization processes with full information. Without scientific interaction and information exchanges between sectors, many of the public researchers who will be tapped for biosafety committees, regulatory agencies, or advisory bodies will be similarly less qualified to provide real expertise.
Insights from the IFPRI Study on PPPs
The 2006 IFPRI study on PPPs provides additional useful insights into inter- actions between the public and private sectors. This section highlights find- ings that relate to the main actors and their objectives, project costs and benefits, risk and risk-management strategies, and safe stewardship.4
MAIN ACTORS AND OBJECTIVES
A key finding of the 2006 IFPRI study was that multinational or foreign firms are engaged in only half of the 14 PPP-based projects that involved
4 The findings are based on data from the 2006 IFPRI study as reported in Spielman, Cohen, and Zambrano (2006a,b); Spielman, Hartwich, and von Grebmer (2007); and Spielman (2009). However, the findings presented here contain new analyses of the data and new findings that build on the previous work.
 
196 CHAPTER 7
agbiotech, with the rest of these partnerships engaging local (typically
seed) firms. And where multinational or foreign firms were engaged with
a CGIAR center, the majority of such partnerships tended to be monoga- mous in nature, that is, involving only the center and the firm, without addi- tional participation from other research organizations or firms. The projects involving multinational or foreign firms (for example, Monsanto, Syngenta, and Pioneer Hi-Bred International) were primarily designed to facilitate technology transfers and negotiate the use of intellectual property owned
by the private-sector partner. In general, these projects did not leverage
other private-sector assets, such as scientific expertise in working with agbio- tech research tools or expertise in navigating regulatory processes to bring research into commercial use. In other words, few CGIAR centers engaged the private sector to conduct frontier research or to form ventures where pub- lic and private actors jointly undertake cutting-edge research activities charac- terized by some unknown probability of success. In Africa, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center’s Insect-Resistant Maize for Africa project has primarily followed this model by first leveraging the private sector as a source of project funding and by later transferring events from the private to the public sector. In contrast, the East Coast Fever vaccine development project involved a higher level of research engagement between the principal organizations—the International Livestock Research Institute and Merial— which can be described as a form of frontier research.
PROJECT COSTS AND BENEFITS
Ideally, the purpose of a PPP-based research project is to lower the costs of research relative to the potential benefits by synergizing both public and pri- vate assets. Although ex ante cost–benefit analyses were not conducted or published for many of the PPP projects identified in the 2006 IFPRI study, findings do suggest that for all agbiotech PPPs (including the two cases from Africa), the projects allowed public researchers to conduct research that would have been prohibitively costly had the public sector been working in isolation. The PPP approach allowed public researchers to access financial resources and useful technologies from the private sector that would have been otherwise unavailable in the public domain.
However, findings also suggest that the coordination costs associated with the partnerships—the costs incurred in searching for partners, maintaining partner commitment, and resolving conflicts among partners—were non- trivial. Although it is difficult to quantify the costs of PPP coordination, find- ings strongly suggest that within-partnership coordination costs are a major

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 197
challenge to successful PPPs. Findings suggest that the two agbiotech PPPs in Africa were no exception to this.
RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Research projects, whether conducted by the public or private sector, are often risky ventures. In the context of agbiotech, these risks may relate to the general environment in which research is conducted, for example, disruptions caused by negative public opinions on GE crops. Or the risks may be specific to the project and related to the probability that the research process will not yield
a successful output or product, will not yield a success within a time horizon that encourages continued investment, or will not yield a product that can pass through legal and regulatory hurdles associated with moving from proof of concept to commercial deployment.
Findings from the 2006 IFPRI study suggest that the agbiotech PPPs are poorly equipped to manage risks associated with the project, whether finan- cial, reputational, or otherwise. This observation is particularly relevant for the two projects in Africa, both of which were initially unable to develop viable products after 5–10 years of research and had to undergo significant changes in project design to continue the research. The financial and reputational risks of limited research outcomes were likely significant in such instances, although efforts to mitigate them have been fairly successful in these examples.5
SAFE STEWARDSHIP
Related to the issue of risk is that of safe stewardship of proprietary technolo- gies and materials used in agbiotech research. Findings from the 2006 IFPRI study suggest that safe stewardship may be the key issue for private-sector part- ners looking to engage with public research organizations in agbiotech research in and for developing countries. Concerns revolve around the legal, financial, and reputational risks that could result from the misuse or abuse of agbiotech tools or materials from partners in public research organizations or by third parties that gain unsanctioned access to these tools and materials.
Findings suggest that legal and contractual strategies—indemnifications and disclaimers, for instance—offer private firms some degree of protection. The African Agricultural Technology Foundation, for example, is mandated to facilitate the transfer of technologies (including, but not limited to,

agbiotech) between research organizations in the public and private sectors (AATF 2009). In doing so, the African Agricultural Technology Foundation provides the expertise—individuals with significant experience in agricul- tural science, communications, legal affairs, and regulatory affairs—needed to design and negotiate formal agreements that address the risks associated with PPPs. But the findings indicate that this is not perceived as adequate protec- tion against risk for private firms.
Regardless of how skilled such organizations as the African Agricultural Technology Foundation are at mitigating risk through legal recourse, or how well a CGIAR center’s own legal capabilities are developed, they are still likely to be limited relative to those of the multinational firms with which they part- ner. Thus, several respondents to the 2006 IFPRI study argued the need to bolster legal expertise at the system- or center-level sufficiently for the CGIAR to confidentially navigate protracted litigation or negotiate with batteries of lawyers from the private sector. Most other respondents, however, thought that legal recourse offered little benefit to any of the parties to a partner-
ship, arguing that legal recourse would only lead to costly litigation and the loss of good faith among partners, thus harming project implementation and the long-term growth of PPPs. Moreover, many argued that legal recourse is difficult to pursue in developing countries, where legal and regulatory regimes are rarely equipped to address the complex issues underlying PPPs and tech- nology development. Ultimately, respondents indicated that well-planned and carefully executed projects were the only real defense against the risks associ- ated with ensuring good stewardship.
Policy Recommendations
Evidence from the two studies examined here indicate that even though pub- lic research in Africa is advancing in several countries, policies may be hin- dering the advancement of this research. Regulatory processes are holding up testing and commercialization, and institutional and organizational barriers to PPPs are inhibiting the application of private-sector resources and exper- tise that would provide valuable learning and information-exchange oppor- tunities. These findings suggest that existing policies are insufficient relative to the requirements needed to realize the benefits of these new technologi- cal opportunities.
There are several regional, national, and global policy options that could improve agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa. One is to enhance the quantity and quality of information on the environmental safety of GE crops

in confined testing or commercial use through information sharing among countries and researchers—such as information about the characteristics of transgenes, gene constructs, host plants, agroecological and agroclimatic zones, experimental designs and observations, and regulatory findings.6
An option is to place this information in an open-access venue, such as the Biosafety Clearing-House, so that environmental assessments of crops
or traits can be carried out based on accumulated experience among indus- trialized and developing countries.7 This approach presents opportunities
for South-South collaboration, information networking, and data sharing, with the objective of minimizing redundancies while maximizing the flow of information and expertise based on solid and comprehensive sources of infor- mation, ultimately increasing regulatory proficiency and minimizing R&amp;D costs. Greater knowledge of the array of available transgenes can also be used to strengthen the public sector’s position in negotiating access agreements over proprietary materials and techniques. In this context, there is also a need to build capacity in research organizations and train local researchers to make effective use of electronic biotechnology research databases and conduct advanced research.
Several innovative approaches to collaborative research could also improve the pace and level of research on agbiotech and GE crops. One possibility is for the public sector to take a stronger public negotiating stance, advocate for greater private tax incentives, or promote other mechanisms to improve the willingness of firms to invest in or provide intellectual property donations for research with a public-interest focus. Other arrangements may be formalized as commercial joint ventures, in which public and private collaborators estab- lish a legal entity to execute a public-interest research agenda and endow it with a mix of governance and management characteristics from the public and private sectors. Lessons can be learned from China, where several agbiotech ventures are advancing as commercial entities spun off from public research agencies, often wholly or majority owned by the parent agency.
Alternatively, researchers and policymakers may explore the use of “hon- est brokers” (nonprofit third-party organizations) to facilitate interactions
6 The Program for Biosafety Systems operates one granting program for research in these areas— the Biotechnology–Biodiversity Interface. Grants are awarded annually following peer review. See PBS (2009).
7 The Biosafety Clearing-House is a mechanism set up by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to facilitate the exchange of information on living modified organisms and assist parties to the Protocol in meeting their obligations under it. The Clearing House provides access to scien- tific, technical, environmental, legal, and capacity-building information in all six of the United Nations’ official languages. See BCH (2009).

between the sectors, manage the research, and assume responsibility for the use of proprietary knowledge and technology. The International Service
for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) and the African Agricultural Technology Foundation are playing such a role in agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa.
The advancement of agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa also requires greater investment in building systems and markets for seed and plant- ing materials. Enactment of plant variety rights and truth-in-labeling laws, combined with a greater commitment from public research organizations to moving technologies off the shelf and into farmers’ fields, would facilitate greater investment in GE research and product deployment in Africa. PPPs, technology commercialization programs, competitive grants, reward/prize programs, and other such approaches could go a long way toward shifting pub- lic research incentives toward more commercially viable outcomes.
Conclusions
Progress in agbiotech and GE crop research, development, and dissemination in Africa is constrained by insufficient investment in—and regulatory imped- iments to—the approval and release of new GE products. The two stud-
ies on agricultural research in developing countries examined in this chapter offer several critical findings about this progress. First, agbiotech and GE crop research is advancing slowly, although there are some signs that new crops, traits, and technologies are in the pipeline for Africa. Second, although some progress has been made in terms of introducing biosafety regulation in many African countries, movement through regulatory processes is inadequate rela- tive to the opportunities offered by the new technologies. Third, critical assets and competencies from the private sector are not being adequately brought
to bear on the research challenge and are not in close collaboration with pub- lic research.
These conclusions strongly suggest that efforts need to be redoubled to promote research, development, and dissemination of GE crops in Africa. For agbiotech to benefit Africa, greater efforts are needed to enhance the inter- national exchange of information on GE crops and to overcome institutional barriers to research collaboration between the public and private sectors. Such efforts would promote a more entrepreneurial culture of innovation and make public research institutions and private companies more responsive to emerg- ing needs and opportunities.

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 201
Success may depend on the emergence of a real breakthrough—the suc- cessful navigation through regulatory processes and deployment through commercial channels of a crop that can make a real difference to small-
scale, resource-poor farmers. Such a breakthrough could demonstrate the tech- nology’s potential to contribute to the region’s development, as well as the importance of the processes needed to make this contribution. However, if the impediments discussed in this chapter persist, the pace of research, develop- ment, and dissemination will be insufficient to generate such a breakthrough, thus slowing the diffusion of new technological opportunities and the poten- tial gains to social and economic welfare in Africa.

Chapter 8
Genetically Modified Foods and Crops: Africa’s Choice
Robert Paarlberg
The future of genetically modified (GM) foods and crops in Africa will depend heavily on choices African governments make regarding the reg- ulation of this technology. There are two different regulatory approaches to choose between: the approach used by the European Union (EU) and
that used by the United States. There are four key differences between
these approaches:
• The regulatory approach used in Europe requires new and separate laws that are specific to GM foods and crops. In contrast, the United States regulates genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for food safety and environmental safety using the laws that were already in place to gov- ern non-GM foods and crops.
• The European approach also requires the creation of new institutions
(for example, national biosafety committees) and a separate screening
and approval process for GMOs. In the United States the institutions
that screen and approve GMOs (the Food and Drug Administration,
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Environmental Protection Agency) are the same institutions that screen and approve non- GM foods and crops.
• The European approach also differs because it can decline to approve a new technology on grounds of “uncertainty” alone, without any evidence of risk. A hypothetical risk that has not yet been tested for is sufficient reason for blockage. This is known as the precautionary approach. In the United States, if standard tests for known risks (such as toxicity, allergenicity, and digestibility) have been passed successfully, there is usually no regulatory barrier to commercial release.
 207

208 CHAPTER 8
• Finally, in Europe products in the marketplace with some GMO content must carry identifying labels, whereas in the United States the Food and Drug Administration does not require labels on any approved GM foods.
Which of these two approaches is better? In the abstract, the best regula-
tory approach is one that allows new technologies to be used while prevent- ing new risks to human health or the environment. Using this standard, the US approach has so far done a better job than the European approach, because it has allowed many more useful new technologies to be employed by farm- ers, fortunately without any documented new risks. In contrast, the European approach has blocked the planting of GM crops in most countries in Europe, and in many cases the consumption of GM foods and feeds, to the frustration of most European farmers, who want to share in the productivity gains these crops provide. Most of the GMOs that have been put on the market over the past dozen years have been approved using the risk-based American regulatory approach rather than the uncertainty-based European regulatory approach, and yet the safety record for the technology has remained essentially un- blemished. This could be seen as a strong recommendation for the American approach. If the European approach had been followed everywhere, many fewer productive technologies would have been available to farmers, and the safety record would not have been any better.
There has not yet been any documented evidence that approved GMOs have posed new risks either to human health or to the environment. This find- ing of “no new risks” is now the official view of scientific authorities in Europe itself. European science academies took a number of years to study the impacts of GM crops on human health and the environment following the first com- mercializations in 1995, but by 2001–04 a consensus had emerged, even in Europe, that no new risks from these seeds had been documented.
In 2001 the Research Directorate General of the EU released a summary of 81 separate scientific studies conducted over a 15-year period (all financed by the EU rather than private industry) aimed at determining whether GM products were unsafe, insufficiently tested, or underregulated (Kessler and Economidis 2001). The EU Research Directorate concluded from this study that “research on GM plants and derived products so far developed and mar- keted, following usual risk assessment procedures, has not shown any new risks on human health or the environment” (EU Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, press briefing, 2001).
National academies of science in Europe began drawing this same conclu- sion one year later. In December 2002, the French Academy of Sciences (2002,

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND CROPS: AFRICA’S CHOICE 209
p. xxxviii) stated that “all the criticisms against GMOs can be set aside based for the most part on strictly scientific criteria.” At the same time the French Academy of Medicine (2002) announced it had found no evidence of health problems in the countries where GMOs had been widely eaten for several years. In the UK in May 2003, the Royal Society presented to a government- sponsored review two submissions that found no credible evidence that GM foods were more harmful than non-GM foods, and the Vice-President and Biological Secretary of the Royal Society, Professor Patrick Bateson, expressed irritation at the undocumented assertions of risk that continued to come from anti-GMO advocates:
We conducted a major review of the evidence about GM plants and human health last year, and we have not seen any evidence since then that changes our original conclusions. If credible evidence does exist that GM foods are more harmful to people than non-GM foods, we should like to know why it has not been made public. [Paarlberg 2008]
In March 2004, the British Medical Association, which had earlier with- held judgment, endorsed these Royal Society conclusions (BMA 2004).
In September 2004 the Union of the German Academies of Science and Humanities produced a report that concluded, “according to present scientific knowledge it is most unlikely that the consumption of the well characterized transgenic DNA from approved GMO food harbors any recognizable health risk” (Helt 2004, 4). This report added that food from insect-resistant GM maize was probably healthier than from non-GM maize due to lower average levels of the fungal toxins that insect damage can cause.
A consensus also emerged at the global scientific level that no new risks
had been linked to any of the GM crops and foods to have reached the mar-
ket so far. In March 2000 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris organized a conference with 400 expert participants
from a variety of backgrounds. These experts announced their agreement that “no peer-reviewed scientific article has yet appeared which reports adverse effects on human health as a consequence of eating GM food” (OECD 2000, 2). In August 2002 the Director-General of the World Health Organization endorsed consumption of GM foods, saying, “[the World Health Organization] is not aware of scientifically documented cases in which the consumption of these foods has negative human health effects. These foods may therefore be eaten” (Mantell 2002).
Some accept that GM foods are probably safe to eat yet still question their safety for other living things in the biological environment (their “biosafety”).

210 CHAPTER 8
All farming disturbs and changes nature, so it is difficult to agree on exactly what level of disturbance can be considered acceptable. For example, plant-
ing a GM variety of beet or rapeseed can help farmers control weeds in the field (compared to conventional beet or rapeseed), and as a result there may be fewer insects in the farm field (using the weeds for food and shelter) and fewer weed seeds for some farmland birds to eat. Some might see this as a damaging disturbance of nature. Yet by most conventional definitions of biosafety, the GM crops currently on the market have not disturbed nature (beyond farm fields) any more than conventional crops do. A 2003 study conducted by sci- entists from New Zealand and the Netherlands published in The Plant Journal examined data collected worldwide up to that time, and the authors concluded from this data that the GM crops approved so far had been no more likely to worsen weed problems than are conventional crops, no more invasive or per- sistent, and no more likely to lead to gene transfer. There was no evidence that GM crops had transferred to other organisms (including weeds) new advan- tages, such as resistance to pests or diseases or tolerance to environmental stress (Connor, Glare, and Nap 2003).
Later in 2003 the International Council for Science examined the find- ings of roughly 50 different scientific studies that had been published in 2002–03 and concluded, “there is no evidence of any deleterious environ- mental effects having occurred from the trait/species combinations currently available” (International Council for Science 2003, 3). In May 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations issued a 106-page report summarizing evidence that “to date, no verifiable untoward toxic or nutri- tionally deleterious effects resulting from the consumption of foods derived from genetically modified foods have been discovered anywhere in the world” (FAO 2004). On the matter of environmental safety, this FAO report found the environmental effects of the GM crops approved so far—including
such effects as gene transfer to other crops and wild relatives, weediness, and unintended adverse effects on non-target species (such as butterflies)—had been similar to those that already existed from conventional agricultural
crops. Finally, in 2007 a study done for the journal Advances in Biochemical Engineering / Biotechnology surveyed 10 years of research published in peer- reviewed scientific journals, scientific books, reports from regions with extensive GM cultivation, and reports from international governmental orga- nizations and found that the data available so far provide no scientific evidence that the cultivation of the presently commercialized GM crops has caused environmental harm (Sanvido, Romeis, and Bigler 2007).

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND CROPS: AFRICA’S CHOICE 211
In 2010, the EU Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (2010, 16) produced yet another reassuring report on GMO safety:
The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than
130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.
Skeptics who remain fearful sometimes respond that “absence of evidence is not the same thing as evidence of absence.” Yet if you look for something for 15 years and fail to find it, that must surely be accepted as evidence of absence. It may not be proof that risks are absent, but proving something is absent (proving a negative) is known to be logically impossible.
The explanation for Europe’s highly precautionary regulatory approach toward GMOs goes beyond risks. It is a policy posture that reflects not a pres- ence of new risks for Europeans, but instead an absence, for most Europeans, of new benefits. The first generation of GM crops provided benefits to farm- ers, but almost no benefit at all to food consumers.
The first generation of GM crops that came to the market in 1995–96 pro- vided benefits mostly to farmers growing cotton, maize, and soybeans in the form of lower costs for the control of insects and weeds. Yet Europe does not have many cotton, maize, and soybean farmers, so the new technology had few champions. For the 99 percent of Europeans who were not maize, cotton, or soybean farmers, the new technology offered almost no direct benefit at
all. For consumers in Europe, the new GM products did not taste any better, look any better, smell any better, prepare any better, or deliver any improved nutrition. Because the vast majority of Europeans saw little or no direct ben- efit from the technology, they felt they had nothing to lose by keeping it out of farm fields and out of their food supply. They welcomed a highly precaution- ary regulatory approach as one way to ensure that outcome.
To demonstrate that it was a benefit calculation rather than a risk calcu- lation that mattered most to Europeans in this case, look at the quite differ- ent way Europe regulates GMOs in medicine versus GMOs in agriculture. In the case of medical drugs, Europe does not hesitate to permit the commercial sale of medicines developed with genetic engineering. By 2006 the European Medicines Agency had actually approved 87 recombinant drugs, derived from GM bacteria or from the ovary cells of GM Chinese hamsters. Significantly, these drugs were not free from new risks; it had been learned from clinical

212 CHAPTER 8
trials that many of these drugs actually increased risks of heart disease, malig- nancy, and gastric illness, but European regulators approved them just the same, because of the benefits the drugs could deliver to so many Europeans. While fewer than 1 percent of Europeans stood to benefit directly from GM agricultural crops, 100 percent were vulnerable to the diseases these GM drugs could help treat, so the regulator treatment of the GM drugs was far less pre- cautionary. There were both known risks from clinical trials and plenty of uncertainties surrounding long-term exposures, yet these risks and uncertain- ties were not allowed to block the commercial release of a technology that could bring significant benefits to Europeans.
Consider now the very different circumstances of Africa. In Africa, the per- centage of the population that might benefit directly from agricultural GMOs is much higher than in Europe, because 60 percent or more of all Africans are still farmers who depend directly on agriculture for income and subsistence. Some GM crop traits now widely commercialized outside of Africa, such as crops with the Bt gene inserted (for example, maize and cotton), which resist insect damage with fewer chemical sprays, could have wide benefits if planted in Africa today. Other GM traits soon to come out of the research pipeline, including abiotic stress tolerance traits, such as drought resistance, could pro- vide even wider benefits in the future.
Drought-tolerant maize is only one of the new GM crop technologies now emerging from the research pipeline. Maize is a staple food for more than 300 million people in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA), many of whom are themselves growers of maize. These Africans remain poor and food insecure because the productivity of their farming labor is so low. Population growth has been pushing maize production into marginal areas with little and un- reliable rainfall, and only 4 percent of cropland in SSA is irrigated. These fac- tors, combined with human-induced climate change, are expected to increase drought risks to maize growers in Africa in the years ahead. The development of maize varieties better able to tolerate drought is one important response to this growing challenge.
Not all drought-tolerant maize varieties are GMOs. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center’s Drought-Tolerant Maize for Africa initiative, funded in 2007 by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and
the Howard G. Buffet Foundation, is designed to accelerate the breeding
of non-GM drought-tolerant varieties of maize (both hybrids and open pol- linated varieties) in 13 countries in SSA. This initiative will use conventional and marker-assisted selection breeding but no transgenic techniques. A second initiative does use GM techniques. This is the Water-Efficient Maize for Africa

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND CROPS: AFRICA’S CHOICE 213
(WEMA) project, funded in 2008 by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and operated in Africa by the African Agricultural Technology Foundation. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center is a partner in this project, as is the Monsanto Company. This initiative will use transgenic tech- niques in addition to conventional and marker-assisted selection.
Regulatory requirements in Africa for GMOs emerge as a critical consid- eration here. WEMA’s GM varieties of drought-tolerant maize will deliver benefits to African farmers only if African regulators first allow the technol- ogy to be tested in open field trials in Africa and then approve the technology for commercial release to farmers. The regulatory gauntlet for this technology will be long and difficult because in Africa, just as in Europe, transgenic tech- nologies are screened using separate and much higher regulatory standards than are used for other technologies. In each separate African country, it will not be possible for technology developers such as the African Agricultural Technology Foundation to conduct research on a WEMA variety (for exam- ple, plant a field trial) without an explicit prior approval from a National Biosafety Committee (NBC). Giving or selling the seed to farmers will not be permitted in any country until the NBC has granted a formal commer- cial release.
Before they grant a commercial release, NBCs typically require that tech- nology developers submit a substantial dossier of data—including the molec- ular characterization of the variety, the results of lab tests for food safety, and the results of field trials for efficacy and biosafety. Once this data is in hand, the NBC can either grant a commercial release promptly; refuse to approve; ask for more data; or do nothing at all, in which case the technology can-
not be legally sold or distributed to farmers. So far, only two governments in SSA have ever given a commercial release to any GM crops: South Africa (for maize, soybean, and cotton) and Burkina Faso (only for cotton) ( James 2011).
Even if there are no arbitrary regulatory slowdowns or blockages, it will still require years for GM varieties of drought-tolerant tropical white maize
to make their way through this regulatory gauntlet in Africa. The first year of WEMA field trials of GM white maize hybrids was completed in 2009 at two sites in South Africa. These were subtropical varieties intended to be used by smallholders in South Africa and parts of Mozambique. Later in 2009 national biosafety regulators in both Kenya and Uganda followed South Africa and approved applications to begin confined field trials of WEMA maize, but reg- ulators in Tanzania did not. Moving beyond the confined field trial stage will be a challenge for Uganda, because the parliament there has not yet passed a national biosafety bill, a measure that GM critics insist is needed before a full

environmental release of any GMO is permitted. In Kenya, moving beyond the confined field trial stage for WEMA maize will be difficult as well. Field trials of GM cotton have been underway in Kenya for years, yet as of 2011 approval for commercial planting had yet to be given. Meanwhile, not even confined field trials have been approved by Tanzania or Mozambique, so even if every- thing works perfectly for the technology, 2013 is now the earliest that field testing of the WEMA varieties can be undertaken in all five WEMA coun- tries, and it will not be until 2015, at the earliest, that WEMA’s GM drought- tolerant tropical white maize hybrids will have undergone enough efficacy testing, agronomic trials, biosafety testing, and variety development in these countries to generate the data needed to support an application to an NBC
for commercial release. Even at this point, there will be little guarantee of a prompt regulatory approval.
Why have so many governments in Africa chosen to follow this highly precautionary European approach toward regulating GM foods and
crops, despite the technology blockages and extended delays nearly cer- tain to result? Five separate channels of external influence on Africa have led to this choice of Europe’s regulatory approach over the approach of the United States.
Bilateral foreign assistance is the first channel of external influence on Africa. Governments in Africa are still significantly dependent on foreign assistance, on average, four times as aid-dependent relative to gross domestic product as the rest of the developing world. For this reason, much that takes place in Africa today remains donor driven. Because Africa’s official develop- ment assistance from Europe is three times as large as that from the United States, it is the voice of European donors in Africa that tends to be more domi- nant than any American voice. Governments in Europe have used their official development assistance to encourage African governments to draft and imple- ment European-style regulatory systems for agricultural GMOs.
A second channel of external influence has been multilateral technical assis- tance through the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) / Global Environment Facility (GEF) Global Project for Development of National Biosafety Frameworks. Of 23 African governments that had completed a National Biosafety Framework under this UNEP program by October 2006, all but South Africa and Zimbabwe had no previous regulations in place for agricultural GMOs, so UNEP was in effect writing on a blank slate. In the end, 21 of these 23 countries embraced the strongest possible approach (the “Level One” approach), requiring regulations through binding legal instru- ments approved by the legislative branch of government (parliament), parallel

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND CROPS: AFRICA’S CHOICE 215
to the European approach. Europe had greater influence than the United States over this UNEP/GEF program because European governments con- tribute roughly three times as much to the GEF trust fund as does the United States.
A third channel of external influence has been advocacy campaigns against GMOs from international nongovernmental organizations, the most active
of which are headquartered in Europe. Greenpeace International and Friends of the Earth International, both based in Amsterdam, have campaigned heav- ily in Africa against agricultural GMOs. Zambian officials were told by Greenpeace that if GMOs were let into their country, organic produce sales to Europe would collapse. An organization named Genetic Food Alert warned Zambia in 2002 of the “unknown and unassessed implications” of eating GM foods, and a British group named Farming and Livestock Concern warned them that GM corn could form a retrovirus similar to HIV. These assertions, which were not backed by any evidence, frightened the Zambians into banning GMOs completely.
A group of mostly European nongovernmental organizations contin-
ued this campaign against GMOs at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa. Led by Friends of the Earth International, they coached their African partners into signing an open let- ter warning that GMOs might cause allergies, chronic toxic effects, and can- cers. At this same meeting in 2002, two Dutch organizations, HIVOS and NOVIB, joined with partner groups from Belgium, Germany, and the UK
to finance a “small-farmers march” on Johannesburg (led by a non-farmer) that ended with a pronouncement that Africans “say NO to genetically modi- fied foods.”
A fourth channel of external influence has been commercial agricul- tural trade. Africa’s farm exports to Europe are six times as large as exports to the United States, so it is European consumer tastes and European reg- ulatory systems that Africans most often must adjust to. In 2000 private European buyers stopped importing beef from Namibia because it had been fed on GM maize from South Africa, and then in 2002 Zambia rejected GM maize as food aid in part because an export company (Agriflora) and the export-oriented Zambia National Farmers Union were anxious that exports of organic baby corn to Europe not be compromised. The risks of export rejections from African countries that plant GMOs are actually quite small, as evidenced by the continued growth of food sales to Europe from South Africa, yet anxieties surrounding export loss play a political role in setting policy.

216 CHAPTER 8
The final channel of external influence is cultural. Most policymaking elites in Africa have much closer cultural ties to Europe than to the United States, so they are naturally inclined to view European practices as the best practices. For example, the Kenyan author of a 2004 article (published
by the European-financed nongovernmental organization Participatory Ecological Land Use Management Association) that was titled “Twelve Reasons for Africa to Reject GM Crops,” later explained to a newspaper reporter, “Europe has more knowledge, education. So why are they refus- ing [GM foods]? That is the question everybody is asking” (Paarlberg 2008, 145). Policymaking elites in Africa have often been educated in Europe, they send their children to European schools, and they travel to Europe fre- quently both on official and unofficial business. It is not surprising that they would be inclined to adopt European-style regulations for GMOs, even though Africa’s needs and circumstances are so different from those
of Europe.
External influence of this kind is not unique to Africa, of course. In Latin America, within the sphere of influence of the United States, government poli- cies toward GM crops have usually been closer to the American approach than to the European approach. As of 2008, 7 out of the top 10 countries around the world with significant plantings of GMOs were located in the Western Hemisphere. It is also telling that the only Asian country to have approved GMO maize, the Philippines, is a former American colony.
In this case political leaders in Africa pay a price for simply “doing what Europeans do.” Europe has placed stifling regulations on GM foods and crops because Europe itself has little need for this new technology. European farmers are already highly productive without it, and European consumers are already well fed. Indeed, like consumers in the United States, Europeans are increas- ingly overfed. In Africa, where farmers are not yet productive and where so many consumers are not yet well fed, the potential gains that GM crops can provide are more costly to do without.
Rather than deferring to outsiders, either Europeans or Americans, Africans might usefully look for ways to make independent judgments of their own regarding how to regulate GM crops. Other countries in the develop-
ing world that still have large farming sectors and operate relatively free from external influence—such as the People’s Republic of China—have so far seen high value in this technology and have been investing significant public bud- get resources of their own to develop this technology, for their own distinct and independent benefit.

Conclusion
Guillaume Gruère, Idah Sithole-Niang, and José Falck-Zepeda
Although genetically modified (GM) crops have been adopted by farm- ers in an increasing number of countries, their use remains very lim- ited in African countries south of the Sahara. Only three countries
have approved GM crops for commercialization. South Africa first planted GM crops in 1997; Burkina Faso and Egypt just started using GM maize and cotton in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Other African countries south of the Sahara have implemented confined field trials of GM crops ( James 2011),
but so far none of these crops has reached farmers’ fields. Detractors have
used the observed limited adoption to support the allegation that GM crops are not—and will not be—useful for African countries south of the Sahara. Even though this argument is deceptively simplistic, it rightly reflects the wider questioning about the current and potential role GM crops and prod- ucts could play in the region in a changing global economic, demographic, and climatic environment.
This book offers a collection of economic and policy studies providing some elements of response to this particular question. Although there is still a significant gap in the literature on the economic effects of GM crops in those African countries south of the Sahara, especially compared to other regions, the selected contributions presented here aim to show that existing research can already bring forward useful lessons for stakeholders and policymakers in this area while pointing toward areas for further inquiries.
More specifically, as noted in the following two sections, we have identified five main lessons from the results of the contributed chapters that outline both the opportunities offered by GM crops and the multiple challenges ahead. Naturally, these conclusions are directly drawn from the individual studies with specific geographic scopes, topics, and methods that can present impor- tant caveats. But the following sections demonstrate that they are representa- tive of other publications on GM crops in those African countries south of the Sahara. Thus, despite the heterogeneous set of countries, crops, and methodol- ogies discussed, these lessons convey a message that so far is validated by avail- able research-based evidence.
 
220 CONCLUSION
Opportunities for African Farmers South of the Sahara
The first main lesson is that, based on available data and published studies, cur- rent GM crops have had on average a positive economic effect in African coun- tries south of the Sahara, but the magnitude and distribution of their potential economic benefits for farmers highly depend on the crop, trait, and especially the institutional setting in which the technology is introduced. An important cor- ollary to this finding is the need for ex ante technology assessment studies to go beyond simple cost–benefit analyses using average performance data and to address such issues as uncertainty, downside risk, and production practices and their limitations. This finding is consistent with the conclusions of Smale et al. (2009) based on an international review of published articles on GM crops in developing economies. It also concurs with the main conclusions of Tripp (2009) based on a compilation of case studies on the use of Bt (insect- resistant) cotton in different countries (including South Africa and others in Asia and Latin America) and with meta-analyses conducted by Finger et al. (2011) and Areal, Riesgo, and Rodriguez-Cerezo (2012).
In a review of the situation and of published economic studies, Gouse (Chapter 1) indicates that the adoption of Bt crops by smallholder farmers in South Africa appears to have resulted in positive agricultural and economic outcomes for a majority of adopters. GM crops in general have been exten- sively adopted there, with annual fluctuations. The South African example of Bt cotton also shows the importance of a proper institutional setting.
Pray et al. (Chapter 2) suggest that the adoption of Bt maize could reduce the exposure of poor farmers in South Africa to the mycotoxin fumonisin and therefore lower the risk of certain types of cancers. But a wider adoption of Bt maize by smallholder farmers in South Africa would not solve the problems of poverty and exposure, and the authors note that Bt maize would need to be adopted in challenging areas where farmers are not currently using GM or hybrid crops.
Two ex ante analyses in this book conclude that GM crops have a sig- nificant role to play in Uganda and thus potentially in other African coun- tries south of the Sahara. Horna et al. (Chapter 3) show that GM cotton has the potential to improve the productivity of cotton in Uganda. At the same time the authors conclude that it will not be a silver bullet for resolving the poor performance of cotton in the country, especially given the lack of ade- quate input. Even though their simulation results demonstrate that the high- est returns are associated with Bt and herbicide-tolerant cotton, they argue that these technologies will not increase the profitability of cotton very much,

as existing low productivity in the cotton sector is a binding factor limiting potential improvements from a damage-control technology such as Bt cotton. Institutional and regulatory issues will need to be addressed if these GM crops are to be successfully commercialized.
Kikulwe et al. (Chapter 4) analyze the case of GM bananas in Uganda using survey data. The authors estimate the annual opportunity cost of non- adoption of these crops as an average 38 US dollars (US$) per Ugandan house- hold. This means that, if the approval decision were made solely on the basis of economic benefits, GM bananas should be immediately released unless the average household is willing to pay US$38 per year to avoid its release, pro- duction, and consumption. Furthermore, Uganda loses a significant amount
of money by not adopting because of the potentially catastrophic damage that the fungal disease black Sigatoka causes on resource-poor farmers who do not have the resources for chemical control.
These results are in line with other economic evaluations of GM crops in other African countries south of the Sahara. Several ex ante simulation stud- ies on Bt cotton in West Africa have concluded that the region would ben- efit from releasing this technology and would lose from avoiding it (Vitale et al. 2007; Falck-Zepeda, Horna, and Smale 2008; Bouët and Gruère 2011). Burkina Faso has adopted GM cotton, but it is too early to quantify its full economic effect in the field, even if results from the field trials (Vitale et al. 2008) and first observations suggest a positive economic effect with yield increases and pesticide reduction (Fasozine 2009; Vitale et al. 2010). An ex ante study of GM vegetables, based on farmer surveys in Ghana, also showed that even if the results depend on the crop, GM vegetables are likely to be eco- nomically advantageous for farmers in Ghana (Horna et al. 2008). Several studies have also focused on Bt cowpeas, with converging evidence on the potential for using GM technologies to improve this widely used staple crop in West Africa (Langyintuo and Lowenberg-DeBoer 2006; Gbègbèlègbè et al. 2009).
Challenges Ahead
Various challenges have constrained the use of GM crop technologies. The studies presented in this book analyze some of the key issues that need to be addressed, from the development of adapted GM technologies to the setting up of regulations and the handling of regulatory burdens and trade and mar- ket acceptance.
CONCLUSION 221

222 CONCLUSION
The second main lesson is that there are insufficient efforts in public and pri- vate biotechnology development in Africa, and that one of the main constraints is related to the policy environment. Spielman and Zambrano (Chapter 7) argue that although public research is advancing, with promising technologies for the African context (such as drought-tolerant maize), policy environments may hinder progress in deploying such technologies. The authors find that the private sector is still left out of the research environment in agricultural bio- technology in Africa and note the need to promote research and development, increase exchanges of information, and promote a more entrepreneurial cul- ture of innovation.
The third lesson is that evolving biosafety regulations in countries south of the Sahara, which tend to determine the degree of deployment of GM crops in the region, appear to be based on a highly costly, European precautionary approach, despite clearly diverging agricultural and development priorities. Paarlberg (Chapter 8) demonstrates that external influence has a critical role in Africa’s choice of regulatory model. Yet the author argues that the European model does not correspond to African needs and realities for a number of reasons, and he concludes that African regulators will be better off by choosing their policies independently of others. Falck-Zepeda and Zambrano (Chapter 6) review biosafety regulatory costs for applicants, showing the high costs for selected East African projects. The authors argue that high regulatory costs can have serious consequences in African biotechnology development. They conclude that biosafety regulatory sys- tems need to balance risk avoidance with the cost of implementation and the potential (net) benefits that the technology may bring when adopted by farmers.
The fourth lesson is that the alleged short-term export risks due to potential market losses in Europe and other GM-averse countries may have been exagger- ated and need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and that the upcoming chal- lenges of market access and import regulations call for regional integration of GM trade regulations.
Wafula and Gruère (Chapter 5) discuss the potential export risks for southern and eastern African countries based on a review of results from the literature. Although each study the authors review presents intrinsic limita- tions, their findings indicate that commercial risk—and possible export loss to the EU—appear to be relatively small in the short and medium terms. Intraregional trade appears to be more important, and therefore regional agreements are critical to the future of GM crops in Africa. Their conclusions are nuanced by the fact that trade may change in the future.

Other trade analyses in the literature confirm these conclusions, but also note the cost of not adopting GE crops when competitors do. For instance, in the case of export risks, Anderson and Jackson (2005) show that the welfare loss with European market restrictions is small compared to the expected gains with GM crops in African countries south of the Sahara. The Langyintuo
and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2006) analysis of the West African regional market for cowpeas concludes that regional introduction of Bt cowpeas would be the best solution to prevent nonadopting countries in the region from losing eco- nomically. Similarly, at the global level, the delayed adoption of Bt cotton in West and Central Africa is found to have a significant cost, given the adoption of this technology by competitors (for example, see Elbehri and MacDonald 2004). More generally, Gruère, Bouët, and Mevel (2011) draw three lessons from the international trade literature on GM crops that do apply to African countries south of the Sahara: (1) GM crop adoption generates economic gains for adopting countries and importing nonadopters, (2) domestic regula- tions can reduce these gains, and (3) import regulations in other countries can also affect the gains of exporting adopters.
One aspect not discussed in this book is the design and implementation
of import regulations in African countries. Kagundu (2009) provides a first assessment of border-control challenges for GM products in Kenya. Kimani and Gruère (2010) discuss the proposed cost of case-by-case import approval and the possible implementation of documentation requirements under the Cartagena Protocol in the same country. Gruère and Sengupta (2010) men- tion the incomplete enforcement of border measures in southern Africa. More studies are needed in this area.
The last lesson is that the level of awareness of GM crops appears to be low among surveyed consumers. In addition, acknowledging this low awareness and the limitation it may confer on survey results, and the fact that only one study is included here, GM technology seems to be generally well accepted among sur- veyed consumers, but urban (especially high-income) consumers appear to have
a lower acceptance of GM food than do rural consumers. If confirmed, this low acceptance may create significant challenges on the road to commercializa- tion of potentially promising GM crops, especially foodcrops and those crops developed by public-sector research.
As mentioned earlier, Kikulwe et al. (Chapter 4) study the acceptance of GM bananas in Uganda. Among other things, the authors find that urban elites are more reluctant to buy GM products than are rural consum- ers. Thus, developers and national policymakers need to implement explicit robust outreach and communication efforts to address public concerns and
CONCLUSION 223

224 CONCLUSION
raise awareness in terms of the potential impact of the introduction of GM crop technologies.
There are a few other studies published on this topic for the region, and they confirm this result. Kimenju and De Groote (2008) analyzed GM
maize acceptance in Kenya and show that awareness of biotechnology is lim- ited in Kenya, especially in rural areas. All consumers are willing to buy GM maize at the same price as non-GM maize, even if there are some concerns. Environmental concerns are found only among urban consumers. In their study of Bt cowpeas in Benin, Niger, and Nigeria, Gbègbèlègbè et al. (2009) found that rural consumers, who tend to be farmers, would be willing to pay more for Bt cowpeas than for the non-GM varieties. In contrast, urban con- sumers are less willing to buy GM cowpeas. In South Africa, a study run by the Ministry of Science and Technology on consumers’ perceptions of biotechnol- ogy found that 75 percent of the respondents were uninformed about biotech- nology (Durham 2009).
A relevant side issue to the policy debate in African countries south of the Sahara in the literature is the possible potential disconnect between consumer perceptions and the local food industry, which may lead to conflicts between these groups, highlighting the need for improved knowledge-exchange chan- nels. Bett, Okuro Ouma, and de Groote (2010) clearly illustrate the latter point in their study of Kenyan gatekeepers’ perspectives, noting that these compa-
nies would benefit if they were informed about the results of consumer surveys. They also provide evidence of the disconnect between consumers and the local industry. Kenyan gatekeepers (millers and supermarkets) are found to be more skeptical than consumers are on the possible use of GM food. Most would pre- fer assessing GM food on a case-by-case basis before purchasing or selling these products. For some of the larger commercial actors, this perception may be related to the great reluctance of buyers abroad regarding the use of GM food. For instance, Gruère and Sengupta (2009) found that GM-free private standards set up by large importing companies in European and other developed countries do influence traders’ decisions and indirectly some policy decisions about bio- technology in eastern and southern African countries. Gruère and Takeshima (2012) provide an economic analysis explaining why importing companies can indeed affect views of decisionmakers in Africa.
Outlook for the Future
These conclusions confirm that GM crops have a significant role to play in agri- culture development in African countries south of the Sahara. But the nature

and modalities of this role will be defined largely by national and regional pol- icy choices as well as the institutional setting in which these technologies will
be deployed to farmers. Although there is evidence that several GM crops could be beneficial to smallholder farmers in Africa, on a case-by-case basis, there is also much work needed to improve the policy, research, and regulatory environ- ment to ensure that they can be a tool to help advance agricultural development. The research results collected in this book suggest that setting up a balanced and functioning regulatory framework is a critical and necessary determinant of the advancement of GM crops. Given current export and import issues, regulat- ing trade of GM products will require regional coordination if not a common framework. In parallel, governments should increase the awareness of farmers, consumers, and the food sector concerning GM crops.
A side result of this book is the call for additional research to be conducted in this area. More data and more rigorous analyses are needed to confirm or complement the lessons of these selected contributions. Only a few coun- tries and crops have been studied, and there are only a few consumer studies in the peer-reviewed published literature. But even focusing on the specific stud- ies presented in this book, there are still important limitations to the research methodologies. This is certainly not limited to studies in Africa (Smale et
al. 2009), but this point needs to be emphasized. Each conclusion naturally stands on the robustness of the arguments, data, and methods used in each particular study.
Other issues that have not been specifically addressed in this book require a lot more research. First, the role of intellectual property rights in facilitating or constraining adoption will continue to be part of the discussions. Second, the acceptance and impacts of GM crops on women farmers, given their impor- tance in African farming and agricultural development, is another priority area for future research. A few projects are ongoing in Africa, but more will need to be done, especially as new GM technologies advance toward commer- cialization. Third, the potential environmental benefits and costs associated with GM technologies in Africa and other regions is still an underinvestigated topic. Although GM crops are often associated with potentially negative envi- ronmental externalities, there is increasing evidence that some of them may also have positive environmental externalities (for example, the effect of Bt crop adoption on water quality or non-target organisms, and broader protec- tion of biodiversity by increasing agricultural productivity). Last, more analy- ses of the political economic rationale driving different countries’ positions for or against GM crop introduction are needed to understand some of the above- listed challenges.
CONCLUSION 225

226 CONCLUSION
What is the outlook for the future? The development or testing of cur- rent and new GM crops and the strengthening of regulatory capacity in several African countries suggest that GM crops will play a growing role in the agricul- ture of African countries south of the Sahara. But their impact on smallholder farmers is uncertain and will depend on the issues outlined in this book.
Clearly, next-generation GM crops—such as those tolerant to drought, resistant to pest and diseases, and with improved nutritional quality—could address other more specific productivity constraints that African farmers face every day. Other examples include crops with increased efficiency in the use of macronutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorus. Furthermore, they could con- tribute to managing risk and address the expected increase in climate change variability. They would thus support African communities’ resiliency and improve the livelihoods of resource-poor farmers.
But this potential can only be made possible through robust and consistent investments in technology and the support of the institutional setting where these technologies will be released to farmers. The driving force for these tech- nologies to advance lies in the hands of national policymakers and their will- ingness to pursue these opportunities. But the capacity, expertise, and support of external institutions will also continue to play major roles. In particular, new players like China and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation acting as donors and technology providers, and such regional bodies as the African Union and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, can be expected to
play a critical role in determining the future of these agricultural technologies. Given the evidence presented here, undertaking these challenges proactively appears to be the best approach for the future.

 AVARIABLE CLIMATE, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS HAVE limited agricultural development in African countries south of the Sahara. Genetically modified (GM) crops are one tool for enhancing agricultural productivity and food security despite such constraints. Genetically Modified Crops in Africa: Economic and Policy Lessons from Countries South of the Sahara investigates how this tool might be effectively used by evaluating the benefits, costs, and risks for African countries of adopting GM crops. The authors gather together studies on GM crops’ economic effects and impact on trade, how consumers view such crops, and other issues. They find that GM crops have had, on average, a positive economic effect in the nations where they were used and identify future steps for enhancing GM crop adoption’s positive effects. Promising policy initiatives include making biosafety regulations that do not make GM crop development prohibitively expensive, fostering intraregional trade in GM crops, and providing more and better information about GM crops to consumers who might currently be skeptical of them. These and other findings in Genetically Modified Crops in Africa indicate ways biotechnology can contribute to economic development in Africa south of the Sahara.

Responsible Innovation Cultural Perceptions of Biotechnology in Food Systems
     Abstract
 Understanding the GMO Food debate in America is complex. The use of food biotechnology to produce herbicide-tolerant and pesticide-resistant crops has sparked broad public discourse and has fueled consumer skepticism regarding food safety. The views on food safety are polarizing - citizens and scientists differ on many issues. Whether science is used to close the gap between these groups has yet to be determined. Research findings and policy making pathways are almost non-existent for underrepresented groups. Among blacks, government distrust and mistrust have historical meaning and real implications. Blacks remain skeptical of government and are also skeptical of genetic engineering, especially when it comes to food safety. Key to responsible innovation is the potential to create pathways into underrepresented communities.
      Review of Literature
 • Cultural attitudes toward genetic engineering affect persistent food skepticism and may lead to scientific mistrust (Ludlow &amp; Smith, 2011; Banati and Szabos, 2006; Goyal &amp; Gurtoo, 2011)
• Consumer awareness and attitudes influence consumer behavior toward GM food supply and may lead to strong preferences for non-GM products (Baker and Burnham, 2001; Hallman et al, 2003; Li, et al 2004; Pew Research, 2006)
• Consumer behavior influenced by consumer belief about GMO food safety (Evans &amp; Ballen, 2013) and consumer acceptance influenced by trust (Han, 2006)
• Cultural cognition of underrepresented groups and their exposure to information influence views on the risks and benefits of GM food supply (Kahan, et al, 2008)
• Faith-based leaders may influence their congregation’s perceptions of risks
regarding GM foods (Omobowale, Singer, Daar, 2009)

          Discussion
Conclusion
Demographics in this study were collected from seven churches and 65 participants, 69% women and 31% men. Average age was 55 years old. Average time in the church was 21 years. Average income was $79,872. More than 75% of households included 2 or more people.
Trust Brokers: Participants trust independent researchers, doctors and their pastor over government.
Credible Brokers: Participants view independent researchers as the most credible source to provide information on the risks and benefits of genetically modified foods.
In underrepresented communities, consumer skepticism persists despite new discoveries in science &amp; technology. Food safety concerns remain even though biotechnology is commonly used in food production. Mistrust in government is pervasive in marginalized communities. Scientists should anticipate that citizen engagement in science and technology may require inclusion strategies beyond science cafes, focus groups, and citizen juries. To be responsive to cultural circumstances, historical realities and social skepticism, scientists may have to go to church to create a meaningful dialogue with underrepresented groups.
   The initial study, Cultural Perceptions of Genetically Modified Foods, was funded by the NC State Genetically Engineering &amp; Society (GES) Center. Two doctoral students in the Department of Public Administration, Ms. Sheron King and Dr. Melanie Riester, helped to conduct focus groups in the Summer of 2014. A special acknowlegement is extended to Dr. Jennifer Kuzma for serving as a faculty mentor for this study.

ISAAA Brief 54-2018: Executive Summary
Biotech Crops Continue to Help Meet the Challenges of Increased Population and Climate Change
Introduction
Biotechnology can be used to develop stress-tolerant and more nutritious crop varieties to protect natural resources and human health. Each biotech crop is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, while approved commercial products in the market have been subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny. Biotech crops should be considered as a tool for improving crop yields, has unblemished record of food safety, and obtain larger income for food-insecure farmers. These economic benefits, health improvement, and social gains obtained through biotech crop adoption should be made known to the global community so that farmers and consumers can make informed choices on what crops to grow and consume, respectively; to the policy makers and regulators to craft enabling biosafety guidelines for commercialization and adoption of biotech crops; and to the science communicators and the media to facilitate dissemination of the benefits and potentials of the technology.

The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications strongly supports the above and the scientific truths underpinning them with the publication of Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2018 (Brief 54). This publication documents the latest information on the subject, the global database on the adoption and distribution of biotech crops since the first year of commercialization in 1996, country situations and future prospects of the technology in the world. Termed as ISAAA Briefs, the annual reports from 1997 to 2015 were authored by Dr. Clive James, and the 1996 report was co-authored with Dr. Anatole Krattiger.

ISAAA dedicates this Brief to Dr. Clive James, Founder and Emeritus Chair of ISAAA, who has painstakingly authored the 20 Annual Reports making it the most credible source of information on biotech crops in the last two decades. We also dedicate this Brief to the late Dr. Randy A. Hautea, former ISAAA Global Coordinator and SEAsiaCenter Director for more than two decades. They have been great advocates of biotechnology and biotech products and believe that ISAAA can make a difference in enhancing the knowledge and capacities of the global community in order to benefit from the technology, especially the poor and marginalized people of the world.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 2018 ADOPTION OF BIOTECH CROPS
High adoption of biotech crops continued in 2018 with 191.7 million hectares worldwide.
On the 23rd year of commercialization of biotech/GM crops in 2018, 26 countries grew 191.7 million hectares of biotech crops – an increase of 1.9 million hectares (4.7 million acres) or 1% from 189.8 million hectares in 2017. Except for the 2015 adoption, this is the 22nd series of increases every single year; and notably 12 of the 18 years with double-digit growth rates.

The adoption rates of the top five biotech crop-growing countries reached close to saturation.
The average biotech crop adoption rate in the top five biotech crop-growing countries increased in 2018 to reach close to saturation, with USA at 93.3% (average for soybeans, maize, and canola adoption), Brazil (93%), Argentina (~100%), Canada (92.5%), and India (95%). Expansion of biotech crop areas in these countries would be through immediate approval and commercialization of new biotech crops and traits to target problems related to climate change and the emergence of new pests and diseases.



Biotech crops increased ~113-fold from 1996 with accumulated biotech area at 2.5 billion hectares; thus, biotechnology is the fastest adopted crop technology in the world.
Global area of biotech crops has increased ~113-fold from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 191.7 million hectares in 2018 – this makes biotech crops the fastest adopted crop technology in recent times. An accumulated 2.5 billion hectares or 6.3 billion acres were achieved in 23 years (1996-2018) of biotech crop commercialization.

A total of 70 countries adopted biotech crops – 26 countries planted and 44 additional countries imported.
The 191.7 million hectares of biotech crops were grown by 26 countries – 21 developing and 5 industrial countries. Developing countries grew 54% of the global biotech crop area compared to 46% for industrial countries. An additional 44 countries (18 plus 26 EU countries) imported biotech crops for food, feed, and processing. Thus, a total of 70 countries in total have adopted biotech crops.

Biotech crops provided more diverse offerings to consumers in 2018.
Biotech crops have expanded beyond the big four (maize, soybeans, cotton, and canola) to give more choices for many of the world's consumers and food producers. These biotech crops include alfalfa, sugar beets, papaya, squash, eggplant, potatoes, and apples, all of which are already in the market. Two generations of Innate® potatoes with non-bruising, non-browning, reduced acrylamide, and late blight resistant traits as well as non-browning Arctic® apples were already planted in the USA. Brazil planted the first insect resistant (IR) sugarcane; Indonesia, the first drought tolerant sugarcane; and Australia planted the first high oleic acid safflower for R&amp;amp;D and seed propagation. Various trait combinations were also approved including high oleic acid canola, isoxaflutole herbicide tolerant (HT) cotton, stacked herbicide tolerant and high oleic acid soybean, HT and salt tolerant soybean, IR sugarcane, and biotech maize with various IR/HT combinations in stack. Additionally, biotech crop research conducted by public sector institutions include rice, banana, potatoes, wheat, chickpea, pigeon pea, and mustard with various economically-important and nutritional quality traits beneficial to food producers and consumers in developing countries.

Biotech soybeans covered 50% of global biotech crop area.
The four major biotech crops -- soybeans, maize, cotton, and canola -- in decreasing area, were the most adopted biotech crops by 26 countries. Soybeans lead at 95.9 million hectares at 50% of the global biotech crop adoption, a 2% increase from 2017. This is followed by maize (58.9 million hectares), cotton (24.9 million hectares), and canola (10.1 million hectares). Based on the 2017 FAO global crop area for individual crops, 78% of soybeans, 76% of cotton, 30% of maize, and 29% of canola were biotech crops in 2018.

The area planted to biotech crops with stacked traits increased by 4% and occupied 42% of the global biotech crop area.
Stacked traits with insect resistance and herbicide tolerance increased by 4% and covered 42% of the global area, a testimony to farmers' adherence to smart agriculture with no till and reduced insecticide use. Herbicide tolerance in soybeans, canola, maize, alfalfa, and cotton has consistently been the dominant trait, which in 2018 covered 46% of the global area – a decrease of 1% compared to 2017.

The top five countries (USA, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India) planted 91% of the global biotech crop area of 191.7 million hectares.
The USA led the biotech crop planting in 2018 at 75 million hectares, followed by Brazil (51.3 million hectares), Argentina (23.9 million hectare), Canada (12.7 million hectares), and India (11.6 million hectares) (Table 1) for a total of 174.5 million hectares, representing 91% of the global area. Thus, biotechnology benefitted more than 1.95 billion people in the five countries or 26% of the current world population of 7.7 billion.

Figure 1. Global Map of Biotech Crop Countries and Mega-Countries in 2018

The US reached an average 93% adoption rate for plantings of biotech soybeans, maize, and cotton
In 2018, the biotech area planted in the USA was 75 million hectares, covering 39% of the global biotech area, with an average adoption rate of 93%. The biotech crops planted were soybeans (34.08 million hectares), maize (33.17 million hectares), cotton (5.06 million hectares), canola (900,000 hectares), sugar beets (491,000 hectares), alfalfa (1.26 million hectares), and some 1,000 hectares of papaya, squash, potatoes, and apples. Weather patterns in the beginning of spring 2018 characterized by cold April to warm May, oversupply of water in some parts in California, and some drought in the southwestern and south central USA contributed to reduced yield. Strong support by the US government on biotechnology calls for streamlining of regulations that have blocked cutting edge technology, setting free the farmers to innovate, thrive, and grow. The average biotech adoption rate of 93.3% from the three major crops: maize, soybeans, and cotton may mean minimal increases expected in the coming years. Thus, expansion in biotech crop area will rely on other biotech crops: canola, alfalfa, sugar beets, potatoes, and apples. The US leads the bandwagon in the discovery, development, and commercialization of biotech crops. The US government’s strong support to biotechnology and the commitment of the U.S. Food and drug Administration (US FDA) to modernize the coordinated framework to regulate biotech products reflect the country’s leadership in acceptance and recognition of the scientific basis of the technology. Expeditious approval of new products of agri-biotechnology benefits not only the USA, but also the global community. In 2018, new food/feed and processing approvals include the Chinese insect resistant rice and IRRI’s Golden Rice. New generation of HT cotton, high oleic acid canola, and low gossypol cotton were approved for environmental release.

Brazil expanded biotech crop area to reach 51.3 million hectares
Brazil planted the second largest area of biotech crops globally in 2018 at 51.3 million hectares compared to 50.2 million hectares in 2017, a 2% increase (1 million hectares), and represents 27% of the global biotech area of 191.7 million hectares. The biotech crops planted in the country include soybeans at 34.86 million hectares, maize (summer and winter) at 15.38 million hectares, cotton at 1.0 million hectares, and 400 hectares sugarcane, which was planted for the first time in Brazil. The total planted area of these three crops in Brazil was 54.88 million hectares, a 1% increase from 53.39 million hectares in 2017. The 51.3 million hectares biotech crop area is a 93% adoption rate, a 1% reduction from 2017. The area grown to biotech soybeans and cotton increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017 due to profitability, higher prices, high market demand both domestically and internationally, and available seed technologies. China was the main export market for soybeans and cotton. In 2018, 80% of Brazil soybean exports were sent to China, estimated to have hit a record of 83 million tonnes total. The availability of subsidized credit for farmers and foreign investments from large agricultural companies has supported the widespread adoption of biotech crops in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the Brazilian court has issued a ruling that lifts the ban on glyphosate in the country. The decision ensures growers’ continued access to glyphosate-based herbicides. A 20-year study of biotech crop cultivation in Brazil indicated an immense reduction in the application of pesticides per hectare and fewer losses caused by pests. Consequently, the productivity and yield of biotech crops have been, on average, higher than conventional crops.

Argentina reached close to 100% adoption rate of biotech crops
Argentina ranked third in the top 10 countries that planted biotech crops in 2018, with a total of 23.9 million hectares, 12% of the global total of 191.7 million hectares and close to 100% adoption rate. The biotech crop area was comprised of 18 million hectares soybeans, 5.5 million hectares maize, and 370,000 hectares cotton. The 23.9 million hectares is an increase of 309,540 hectares or 1.3% from 23.6 million hectares planted in 2017. Severe drought during the peak summer months reduced the area planted to biotech soybeans and resulted to importation of US soybeans to Argentina for the first time in decades. Soybean stacked trait Intacta™ introduced to farmers in 2015 was launched on 70,000 hectares, increased by 40.2% from 2017 (3.08 million hectares) – an indication of farmers adopting a technology that reduces costs and increases profits. The total maize area in 2018 increased by 5.6% from 5.4 million hectares in 2017 to 5.7 million hectares, and total cotton area in Argentina increased by 60% from 250,000 hectares in 2017 to 400,000 in 2018. After the previous years’ low approval, the Argentinian government through the Argentine National Advisory Committee on Agricultural Biotechnology (CONABIA) approved eight biotech crop applications in 2018: seven full approvals comprised of four maize IR/HT stacked events, two HT soybeans, and alfalfa event, plus one soybean event for food, feed, and processing only.

Canada reached 92.5% adoption rate
Canada planted a total of 12.75 million hectares of six biotech crops in 2018, a ~3% decrease from 13.11 million hectares in 2017. This was 7% of the global biotech crop area and was comprised of 2.4 million hectares soybeans, 1.6 million hectares maize, 8.7 million hectares canola, 15,000 hectares sugar beets, 4,000 hectares alfalfa, and 65 hectares potatoes. The slight decrease in biotech area was due to reduction in planted areas of soybeans, maize and canola. Other biotech crops, including alfalfa, sugar beets, and potatoes, planted in smaller area, increased slightly in 2018. However, the average adoption rate of 92.5% was an increase of 2% from 2017. Several approvals were given by the government of Canada. Three varieties of biotech apples (Arctic® Golden Delicious, Arctic® Granny Smith, and Arctic® Fuji) were approved for commercial planting purposes, livestock feed, and food use. Biotech Golden Rice with provitamin A Event GR2E received approval from Health Canada. This decision coincides with the approval from Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) in 2018. Health Canada also approved the insect resistant sugarcane and decided that the sugar produced was as safe as the produce from conventional sugarcane. Also in 2018, 7 tonnes of biotech salmon fillet were sold by US-based AquaBounty Technologies in Canada.

India: IR (Bt) cotton adoption increased to 95%
In 2017-18, the adoption of officially approved IR cotton represents 95% of 12.24 million hectares of cotton planted in India. Due to the successful control of the spread of unapproved IR(Bt)/HT cotton, India achieved higher planting of officially approved IR cotton to 11.6 million hectares in 2018-19, an increase of 200,000 hectares over 2017-18 and planted by over 6 million farmers. Adoption rate went down to 93% in 2017 after an all-time high of 96% in 2016 when unapproved IR/HT cotton estimated at 3.5 million packets were planted over approximately 760,000 hectares. Thus, attaining 95% adoption rate again and 6% biotech crop area indicate the restoration of farmers’ confidence on the Bt cotton technology and a sign of demand for the approval of next generation biotech cotton technology including stacked IR/HT cotton. The nationwide management of pink bollworm campaign, which was implemented in cotton growing States, focused on dryland farmers in Maharashtra in 2018. The campaign included farmers educational programs, workshops, and awareness and training programs involving key stakeholders. This contributed to increasing farmer awareness resulting in significant control of pink bollworm in the 2018 Kharif season. However, reports from different maize growing States of India indicated the devastating infestation of fall armyworm on maize, causing heavy damages in both Kharif and Rabi seasons. Activities to raise awareness on the control of fall armyworm is in full swing which could push IR maize planting in India.

Ten countries in Latin America grew 81.93 million hectares of biotech crops
Ten countries in Latin America planted biotech crops in 2018 including Brazil (51.3 million hectares), Argentina (23.9 million hectares), Paraguay (3.8 million hectares), Uruguay (1.3 million hectares), Bolivia (1.3 million hectares), Mexico (218,000 hectares), Colombia (88,000 hectares), Honduras (35,500 hectares), Chile (10,454 hectares), and Costa Rica (139 hectares) for a total of 81.93 million hectares, an increase of 2.4% from 79.4 million hectares in 2017. Latin America covered 42.7% of the global biotech area of 191.7 million hectares in 2018. Increases in absolute number of hectares and percent area were recorded in several countries, led by Brazil at 1.1 million hectares (2%), Paraguay (800,000 hectares, 27%), Argentina (300,000 hectares, 1%), Uruguay (200,000 hectares, 18%), Mexico (100,000 hectares, 100%), and a small increase of 4,000 hectares (10%) in Honduras. The increase in biotech crop area in most of the Latin American countries compensated for the losses from the extensive drought in 2017. In addition, profitability, elevated prices, high market demand in local and international market, and available seed technologies for soybeans and cotton; available subsidized credit for farmers and foreign investments from the industry; favorable weather and improved agronomic practices with efficient fertilizer applications encouraged farmers in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Honduras to plant biotech crops. In Mexico, the 100% increase in cotton area was due to farmers’ return to maize planting after a year of crop rotation as well as the favorable climate for planting and price of cotton.

The prospect for future expansion of biotech area in Latin America looks positive as more technologies come with different crops and traits. In Brazil, IR sugarcane has been planted in 400 hectares for the first time. In Argentina, the government approved the HT and low lignin alfalfa for commercialization (the third approval in the world after the USA and Canada), and approved the field trials of drought tolerant wheat and soybeans, new generation HT soybeans, and non-browning apples. The other Latin American countries may follow Brazil and Argentina as they enhance their capacity and increase awareness on biotechnology.

Nine countries in Asia and the Pacific grew 19.13 million hectares of biotech crops
Biotech countries in the Asia and Pacific region were led by India with the largest area of biotech crops at 11.6 million hectares cotton, followed by China (2.9 million hectares cotton and papaya), Pakistan (2.8 million hectares cotton), Australia (793,000 hectares cotton and canola), Philippines (630,000 hectares maize), Myanmar (310,000 hectares cotton), Vietnam (49,000 hectares maize), Bangladesh (2,975 hectares eggplant), and a returning biotech crop country, Indonesia (1,342.59 hectares drought tolerant sugarcane). This region planted 19.13 million hectares (the same as 2017) of biotech crops, 10% of the global biotech crop area of 191.7 million hectares.

Increases in biotech area were obtained in India (200,000 hectares, at 2%), China (100,000 hectares, 4%), Vietnam (4,000 hectares, 9%), and Bangladesh (575 hectares, 24%). The favorable global cotton price has positively impacted biotech cotton adoption in India and China, while public acceptance of clean and hazard free production of biotech eggplant motivated more farmers in Bangladesh. In Vietnam, the low price of imported maize and overall production trend of switching from maize to other higher value crops has minimally increased biotech maize area. 

However, this area expansion of biotech crops was made almost even by the decrease in biotech crop areas in Pakistan (decrease of 200,000, at -7%), Australia (decrease of 100,000 hectares, -11%), Philippines (decrease of 12,000 hectares, -2%), and Myanmar (decrease of 10,000 hectares, -3%).

Indonesia, a returning biotech country has planted a new biotech drought tolerant sugarcane that can yield 20-30% higher than the parental varieties during drought conditions. The planting of the biotech drought tolerant sugarcane was developed to close the gap between domestic supply and demand for sugar as Indonesia is the world’s largest importer of sugar. The drought tolerant trait would allow farmers to plant even at periods with low rainfall which seems to become worse and frequent due to climate change.

There are a number of new biotech crops and traits in the pipeline for commercial release including the staple crops Golden Rice, late blight resistant potato, various biotech traits for wheat,  and IR (Bt) eggplant; biotech soybeans and maize for livestock and poultry feed; and varieties of cotton which contain stacked IR/HT traits.

One of the most important problems in Asia and the Pacific was the delay in approving new biotech crops and traits in China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Regulatory guidelines in these countries have been in place and used to regulate biotech products efficiently for more than a decade, but the changing political climate and the loud voice of critics have become a strong barrier for trade and commercialization of biotech crops.

The Kingdom of eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) was the latest and third African country to plant biotech cotton
The African continent remains the region with the biggest potential to reap the benefits associated with modern agricultural biotechnology. In 2018, the continent recorded impressive growth with South Africa planting 2.7 million hectares of biotech crops sustaining its ranking among the top 10 biotech crop countries in the last two decades. Moreover, Nigeria became the first country in the world to approve biotech cowpea, thus, adding a new biotech crop to the global biotech basket. The kingdom of eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) started commercial planting of IR (Bt) cotton on an initial launch of 250 hectares, making it the third African country to plant biotech crops. This brought the number of African countries currently growing biotech crops to 3 again – South Africa (2.7 million hectares), Sudan (with 243,000 hectares IR cotton), and eSwatini for a total of 3.14 million hectares. Two more countries – Ethiopia and Nigeria gave environmental release approvals: Ethiopia for Bt cotton, while Nigeria approved cotton and cowpea. Earlier, Kenya and Malawi also granted environmental release approvals and are working towards commercialization of biotech cotton in the short-term.

Two countries in the European Union continued to plant biotech maize at 121,000 hectares
Two countries in the European Union (EU), Spain and Portugal, have consistently planted biotech IR maize event MON810, the only biotech event approved in the EU. The total biotech crop area planted was 120,990 hectares, a slight decrease of 8% from 2017 area of 131,535 hectares. Spain planted 115,246 hectares, 95% of the total 131,535 biotech maize hectares, while Portugal planted 5,733 hectares. The acceptance of biotech crops in the EU is still far from improving. Spain and Portugal planted biotech maize because of the expected infestation brought by the European corn borer. There was less motivation to plant biotech maize in the EU since the market calls for non-biotech raw materials. Imports of feedstocks from Argentina, Brazil, and the US were mostly biotech. There were up to 30 million metric tons soybean products, 10 to 15 million metric tons of maize, and 2.5 to 4.5 million metric tons canola that have been exported to the EU. This situation is expected to continue as there was no change in the EU regulation, there was no approval for cultivation in sight, and movement against biotech crops was still strong. In the beginning of 2018, six biotech crops were authorized for entry into the EU for food and feed uses including four soybean events, one canola, and one renewal for maize. Before the end of the year, two new varieties of maize and renewal of three existing authorizations for maize and sugar beets were approved for food and feed uses.

STATUS OF APPROVED EVENTS FOR BIOTECH CROPS USED IN FOOD, FEED, PROCESSING, AND CULTIVATION
A total of 70 countries (42 + EU 28, counted as one) have issued regulatory approvals to genetically modified or biotech crops for consumption either as human food, animal feed, as well as for commercial cultivation. Since 1992, there have been 4,349 approvals granted by regulatory authorities of these 70 countries. These were granted to 387 biotech events from 27 biotech crops, excluding carnation, rose, and petunia.

Of these approvals, 2,063 were food, either for direct use or for processing, 1,461 were feed use, for direct use or processing, while 825 were for environmental release or cultivation. United States had the most number of GM events approved, followed by Mexico, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, EU, Colombia, and Brazil. Maize still had the most number of approved events (137 in 35 countries), followed by cotton (63 events in 27 countries), potatoes (49 events in 13 countries), soybeans (38 events in 31 countries), and canola (37 events in 15 countries).

The HT maize event NK603 (61 approvals in 28 countries + EU 28) still had the most number of approvals. It was followed by HT soybeans GTS 40-3-2 (57 approvals in 28 countries + EU 28), IR maize MON810 (55 approvals in 26 countries + EU 28), HT/IR maize Bt11 (54 approvals in 25 countries + EU 28), HT/IR maize TC1507 (53 approvals in 25 countries + EU 28), IR maize MON89034 (51 approvals in 24 countries + EU 28), HT maize GA21 (50 approvals in 23 countries + EU 28), HT soybeans MON89788 (45 approvals in 25 countries + EU 28), HT soybeans A2704-12 (45 approvals in 24 countries + EU 28), HT/IR maize MON88017 (45 approvals in 23 countries + EU-28), IR cotton MON531 (44 approvals in 20 countries + EU 28), IR maize MIR162 (43 approvals in 23 countries + EU 28), and HT maize T25 (43 approvals in 20 countries + EU 28).

CONTRIBUTION OF BIOTECH CROPS TO FOOD SECURITY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION
Biotech crops are being adopted globally because of the enormous benefits to the environment, health of humans and animals, and contributions to the improvement of socio economic conditions of farmers and the general public. Global economic gains contributed by biotech crops in the last 21 years (1996-2016) have amounted to US$186.1 billion economic benefits to more than 16 to 17 million farmers, 95% of whom come from developing countries.

Biotech crops contributed to food security, sustainability and climate change solutions by:

increasing crop productivity by by 657.6 million tons valued at US$186.1 billion in 1996-2016; and 82.2 million tons valued at US$18.2 billion in 2016 alone;
conserving biodiversity in 1996 to 2016 by saving 183 million hectares of land, and 22.5 million hectares of land in 2016 alone; providing a better environment
by saving on 671 million kg. a.i. of pesticides in 1996-2016, and by 48.5 million kg in 2016 alone from being released into the environment;
by saving on pesticide use by 8.2% in 1996-2016, and by 8.1% in 2016 alone;
by reducing EIQ (Environmental Impact Quotient) by 18.4% in 1996-2016, and by 18.3% in 2016 alone
reducing CO2 emissions in 2016 by 27.1 billion kg, equivalent to taking 16.7 million cars off the road for one year; and
helping alleviate poverty through uplifting the economic situation of 16-17 million small farmers, and their families totaling  &gt;65 million people, who are some of the poorest people in the world (Brookes and Barfoot, 2018). 
Thus, biotech crops can contribute to a “sustainable intensification” strategy favored by many science academies worldwide, which allows productivity and production to be increased on the current 1.5 billion hectares only of global crop land, thereby saving forests and biodiversity. Biotech crops are essential but are not a panacea, and adherence to good farming practices such as rotations and resistance management, are a must for biotech crops as they are for conventional crops.



ECONOMIC GAINS FROM BIOTECH CROPS REACHED US$186.1 BILLION FROM 1996 TO 2016
A total of US$186.1 billion economic benefits were gained by countries planting biotech crops from 1996 to 2016. The highest gain was obtained by the USA (US$ 80.3 billion), Argentina (US$23.7 billion), India (US$21.1 billion), Brazil (US$19.8 billion), China (US$19.6 billion), Canada (US$8 billion), and others (US$13.6 billion). For 2016 alone, six countries gained the most economically from biotech crops in 2016, they were the USA (US$7.3 billion), Brazil (US$3.8 billion), India (US$1.5 billion), Argentina (US$2.1 billion), China (US$1 billion), Canada (US$ 0.7 billion), and others (US1.8 billion) for a total of US$18.2 billion. For 2017, the US$18.2 billion economic benefits comprised of US$10 billion for developing countries and US$8.2 for industrial countries.

In 2017, the global market value of biotech crops, estimated by Cropnosis was US$17.2 billion, representing 23.9% of the US$70.9 billion global crop protection market in 2016, and 30% of the US$56.02 billion global commercial seed market (Cropnosis, personal communication, 2018). Two industry sources projected an increase of 8.3% to 10.5% in the global value of biotech seed market by the end of 2022 and 2025, respectively. These are enormous benefits that can be obtained in the seed market if biotech crops are continuously planted globally.

CONCLUSION
The Global Report on Food Crises 2017 revealed that the UN Millennium Development Goals (UN-MDG) that ended in 2015 were not achieved, and that around 108 million people in 48 food crisis-affected countries are still at risk or in severe acute food insecurity since 2016 (FAO, July 23, 2017). Moreover, the United Nations (UN) report State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World in 2018 indicated that for three years in a row (since 2016), there was a continuous increase of hunger worldwide, with current levels equivalent to the records a decade ago. The report also emphasized that there was a slow progress in addressing the multiple forms of malnutrition which includes child stunting and adult obesity, making the health of hundreds of millions of people at risk. These findings translate into a clear warning that more efforts must be done rapidly to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger by 2030.

Once again, in its 23rd year of commercialization, the increase in global biotech crop adoption (cultivation and import for food, feed, and processing) manifest satisfaction of more than 17 million farmers, 95% of whom are small farmers, and consumer acceptance due to the agricultural, socio-economic, and environmental benefits as well as food safety and nutritional improvement brought by biotech crops. The contribution of this continuing increase in biotech crop adoption could help in alleviating the problems of hunger and malnutrition globally. Ensuring that these benefits will continue now and in the future depends on the diligence and forward-looking regulatory steps based on science, critically looking at the benefits instead of risks, agricultural productivity with a sense of environmental conservation and sustainability, and most importantly taking into consideration the millions of hungry and impoverished populace in need of resources.

The British government went to great lengths to provide scientific and ethical support for growing GM crops.
However, this did not sway public opinion.

Scientists did not realize that the public views risk very differently from them.

NGOs have also been very skillful about their messaging.

The benefits of the technology were not obvious to the average consumer.

Since there was not compelling reason to support the technology,
the easiest course of action was to be precautionary.</Text>

                               A critical evaluation of EFSA’s environmental risk assessment of genetically modified maize MON810 for honeybees and earthworms
Veronika Chvátalová*
Abstract
Background: In the European Union (EU), genetically modified (GM) crops are permitted for cultivation only after
a thorough risk assessment and a decision by the European Commission (EC). The central scientific body assessing food-related risks is the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). It aims to provide high-quality scientific advice for EU decision-makers. However, both the way EFSA performs risk assessment and the independence of its panel members have been subjected to consistent criticism. In this paper, I examine part of the environmental risk assessment in the Scientific Opinion issued by the EFSA GMO Panel, specifically, the impacts of GM maize MON810 on honeybees and earthworms. The evaluated EFSA document forms the scientific basis of the pending EC Draft implementing decision to renew the authorisation for the lawful cultivation of MON810. I assess the reliability of scientific information cited in the Opinion, the use of this information by EFSA, and the safety conclusions drawn in a form of an extended peer review.
Results: My research indicates that the scientific studies cited in the EFSA Opinion in the sections concerning the possible impacts of GM maize on honeybees and earthworms stem predominantly from reliable sources in terms
of authorship, financial support, and status of the study. However, the reliability of the studies varies significantly concerning the ecological relevance of the experiments. Moreover, the body of referenced evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on risk. Relevantly, several types of shortcomings in the use of scientific information in the risk assessment were identified as prevalent, namely: EFSA omits relevant available studies, selectively cites information, misquotes studies, fails to acknowledge uncertainties, fails to call for further research where needed, and fails to criti- cally interpret studies and their findings.
Conclusions: Overall, the findings indicate that the reliability of scientific information and particularly its use by the EFSA GMO Panel produces low-quality scientific advice, which is inconsistent with the Authority Mission Statement. My research would support the call by the European Parliament and NGOs on the EC to withdraw its Draft imple- menting decision intended to renew the authorisation of MON810 cultivation.

Background
The current state of genetically modified crops
Genetically modified (GM) crops have been grown on an increasing area globally since 1992 [1, 2]. However, the number of countries growing them stopped increasing in 2011 and there has been a decreasing trend since then. In the European Union (EU), the situation is even more pronounced. The number of member states growing GM crops has been dropping, and it has predominantly been only Spain that keeps the area planted with GM crops in Europe fluctuating upwards [2]. Currently, only one type of GM crop is permitted for cultivation in the EU, the insect-resistant maize MON810.
The situation in the European Union
The authorisation process for applications for the mar- keting or cultivation of GM crops in the EU is considered by its proponents and the European Commission (EC) as one of the strictest in the world. Each new event of a genetically modified organism (GMO) has to undergo a thorough risk analysis before a committee of member states votes on the approval for commercialization. The assessment of the first applications for genetically modi- fied products (first authorised in 1995) were under the auspices of the Scientific Committees on Plants and on Food. This task was taken over in 2003 by the then newly created GMO Panel of the European Food Safety Author- ity (EFSA).
The GM maize MON810 was authorised for cultiva- tion and use as/in food and feed in 1998 for 10 years. Monsanto applied for a renewal of the authorisation for MON810 cultivation in 2007. Despite a favourable 2009 EFSA Opinion [3] on the application, the EC has not decided yet (as of June 2019) and the Bt maize remains lawfully on the market authorised under the Directive 90/220/EEC.
Although the cultivation of this GM maize has been allowed since 1998, it was first grown in 2003 in Spain with the majority of other member states never joining in. On the contrary, the number of member states who ceased the cultivation or imposed a ban on MON810 has been increasing since that time.
The restrictions on GM crops’ cultivation in the EU
Until recently, member states who refused to grow GM crops invoked the safeguard clause1 of Directive 90/220/EC and subsequently Directive 2001/18/EC ena- bling them to restrict or prohibit the use of a particular GMO on their territory if new evidence since the EFSA’s
assessment became available that indicated it constituted a risk to the environment or human health. Following the implementation of the safeguard clause to introduce restrictions on planting in certain member states, EFSA was asked by the European Commission to evaluate if the invocations were scientifically justifiable. The Author- ity concluded that its previous risk assessment conclu- sions remained valid in all cases and that the GM crops in question were safe [4].
The EC attempted to resolve the contradiction between the official European safety assurance concerning GM crops and the challenges to it from member states in 2015 by creating an amendment to Directive 2001/18/EC that allows member states to restrict or prohibit cultivation on their territory or part of it.2 According to this Direc- tive (EU Directive 2015/412), however, member states can only prohibit the authorised GM crop cultivation on grounds3 that do not “conflict with the environmental risk assessment carried out pursuant to this Directive”, thus ensuring the sovereignty of EFSA’s assessment as authoritative on questions of scientific risk [5].
The role of EFSA in the decision‐making process
The role of EFSA’s risk assessment is crucial in the whole decision-making process concerning GMOs. The Euro- pean Commission bases its draft decision about applica- tions for authorisation of GM food, feed, or growing of GM plants on EFSA’s risk assessment. The draft deci- sion should then be adopted or rejected by a qualified majority of Member States Experts (MSE) Commit- tee. When no qualified majority is reached, the draft is passed on to the Appeal Committee which can again adopt or reject it or issue “no opinion”. In the third case is the draft adopted by the EC. Indeed, final decisions have been adopted by the EC on the basis of positive opinions issued by EFSA, because neither the MSE nor the Appeal Committee reached a qualified majority since 2003 [6, 7]. The concern is that EFSA has been criticised for issu- ing favourable opinions despite inadequate information for environmental risk assessments (ERA) submitted by applicants and improvements to the Authority’s own ERA have been suggested [6, 8, 9].

in Spain in the remaining EU states [2].
3 The grounds for prohibition of an authorised GMO may be related to: environmental policy objectives; town and country planning; land use; socio-economic impacts; avoidance of GMO presence in other products; agricultural policy objectives; and public policy [5]. Member states do not need to justify their wish to exclude their territory or part of it from the GM crop cultivation during the authorisation process or during the renewal of the authorisation of a GMO, only if this decision is contested by the appli- cant [5].
The safeguard clause was invoked successively by Austria, France, Germany,

The critiques of EFSA and its GMO Panel
EFSA was established in 2002 to provide scientific advice on risks related to the food chain, striving for “scientific excellence” [10]. Notwithstanding, the aim for scientific excellence in both the way EFSA performs risk assessment and the independence of its panel members have been challenged over the years since its establishment.
Conflict of interests
According to EFSA’s own description, one of its key val- ues is independence: “EFSA is committed to safeguard- ing the independence of its experts, methods and data from any undue external influence and to ensuring that it has the necessary mechanisms in place to achieve this.” [10]. Nevertheless, its independence from eco- nomic interests and national and policy influences has been questioned by the European Parliament, NGOs, the media, national governments, and scientists [11– 13]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that members of the EFSA Panels have been appointed on the basis of their willingness to reach consensus [13].
The GMO Panel that was responsible for issuing the favourable report on GM maize MON810 has been criticised for more than half of its members having a conflict of interests [14]. Despite this, the Panel states that no member abstained from the discussion on the subject due to any possible conflict of interests [3]. This problem is not specific or restricted to one term of office. The very first GMO Panel, established in 2003, was also criticised on the same grounds and even after the adoption of the new policy on independence in 2011, and its revised version in 2014, the situation of EFSA’s Panels continues to be criticised for containing members with significant conflicts of interests [11, 15, 16].
The existence of conflicts of interests does not nec- essarily imply malpractice, but may be a source of sci- entific bias [17–19]. An apt illustration might be the influence of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI, “a controversial food and biotech industry- funded scientific think tank and lobby group” [14]) on the development of EFSA’s guidance for the risk assess- ment of food and feed derived from GM crops [20]. The risk assessment of GM crops has been based on a prob- lematic concept of “comparative assessment”, which has been attributed to a network around a chairman of the GMO Panel who was working at the same time for ILSI [20, 21]. The establishment of the industry-friendly concept has been criticised for resulting in a less rig- orous investigation of the possible risks posed by GM crops [20].
Quality of science
Another of EFSA’s key values is to provide “high-quality scientific advice” [10]. However, the quality and use of scientific information in its risk assessments has also been criticised both by NGOs and scientists [13, 22].
Despite claiming a strict distinction between the claimed value-free science provided by the Authority and the politically driven management measures taken by the EC, it has been suggested that EFSA’s opinions have been based on a range of normative judgments about what constitutes acceptable or relevant effects [13] and its scientific critique to be laden with social, political, and ethical dimensions [23].
Furthermore, the quality of scientific output pro- duced by the GMO Panel has been criticised in regard to (synthesis drawn from [8, 13, 22–26]):
• Selective use of studies and results of studies
• Inappropriate interpretation of scientific information
• Use of double standards in scrutiny of scientific evi-
dence
• Misleading presentation of study results
• Failure to cite sources of information
• Failure to acknowledge uncertainties of risks
• Failure to call for further research
• Use of double standards in dealing with uncertainties
in studies according to the study findings
• Assessments based on untested or questioned
assumptions.
In conclusion, the way that EFSA uses scientific infor- mation has been significantly challenged and seen to not even meet certain basic scientific standards much less represent “high-quality scientific advice”. The repeated identification of shortcomings in EFSA’s work is of high concern given that the Authority’s outputs serve as a basis for decision-making.
Concept of risk assessment
Although EFSA claims to have developed “good risk assessment practices” [10], the concept of risk assess- ment that it adopts has been criticised by NGOs, the European Commission and scientists [21, 24, 27, 28].
The point of many critiques has been the concept of “substantial equivalence”, which is the underlying con- cept for ERA [21]. Specifically, the design of ERA was criticised for solely focusing on the newly expressed pro- tein, insufficient testing of chronic and indirect effects, choice of test organism, and testing procedures [21]. As a result, certain risks are not assessed, e.g., the long-term and combinatorial effects. Furthermore, the effects of

herbicide use4 associated with cultivation of GM herbi- cide-resistant crops, and the possibility of uncontrolled spread of GMOs, are disregarded in the risk assessment according to national EU experts on GMOs [28].
The purpose of the study
Against this backdrop, the aim of this study was to criti- cally evaluate how the EFSA GMO Panel performed its environmental risk assessment in a specific case. Given the presumably greater risk to the environment from growing rather than from the import of a GMO, I chose the assessment of risks to non-target organisms from cul- tivation of Bt maize MON810, the only GM crop grown commercially in the EU over a longer period.
The evaluated EFSA document forms the basis for the EC Draft implementing decision intended to renew the authorisation of MON810 cultivation [29]. Relevantly, the DG environment recommended to progress with the approval process only with updated and complete ERA by EFSA and the European Parliament called on the EC to withdraw its draft [30, 31].
The second aim was to help increase the robustness of advice for future decision-making on GMOs by demon- strating the inherent flexibility in how science is gener- ated and interpreted. The case of GMO risk assessment serving for policy decisions is a perfect example of an issue where “facts [are] uncertain [and] values in dispute”, allowing for different conclusions based on the same results, while “stakes [are] high and decisions urgent” [32]. Under such conditions, an extended peer review can contribute to the quality assurance of the advice used for decision-making [32]. “Extended” here refers to a review that includes other types of experts and stakeholders, and the different quality criteria and modes of reflection of both natural and social sciences [33].
The analysis was guided by the “Reliability Rating and Reflective Questioning” framework developed by Wick- son [33] to perform a critical evaluation of Australia’s risk assessment of GM Bt cotton. This method evaluates both the quality of the science used in an assessment, as well as the way that it is used to draw conclusions. In what fol- lows below, I assess both of these components for EFSA’s ERA on MON810.
The main finding of this study is that, based on the crit- ical evaluation of EFSA’s risk assessment, the Authority cannot claim “scientific excellence”, and indeed that the way it treats scientific information leads to the opposite of “high-quality scientific advice”. The analysis confirmed many of the previously identified shortcomings, and, in

addition, provides an assessment of the independence and reliability of the source of scientific information on which basis EFSA conducts its work.
This manuscript is an extended version of a conference paper “Science for policy: assessing genetically modified crops in the EU” presented at the STS Conference Graz on Critical Issues in Science, Technology and Society Studies in 2017 [34].
Methods
Subject of the analysis
In this study, I examine EFSA’s “Scientific Opinion on Applications for renewal of authorisation for the contin- ued marketing of food, feed, and seed for cultivation of GM maize MON810” issued in 2009, referred to here as the Opinion [3]. Among other issues, the Opinion deals with “Environmental risk assessment and monitoring”, which consists of chapters “Evaluation of relevant scien- tific data” and “Post-market environmental monitoring”. Scientific information is cited concerning the assessment of the possible effects of GM maize, including its impacts on human and animal health, abiotic environment, and agricultural techniques, in the former chapter.
Given the nature of the genetic modification, which enables the plant to produce a toxin targeted at a spe- cific pest, the subchapter “Interactions between the GM plant and non-target organisms” forms a crucial part of the environmental risk assessment. This part of the Opin- ion assesses possible impacts on ten different groups of organisms that are not supposed to be affected by the toxin (Cry1Ab protein or simply Bt protein/toxin).
In this study, I perform an evaluation of the ERA for two groups of non-target organisms: “Pollinating insects: hon- eybees” and “Soil organisms: earthworms”. I deliberately chose not to assess the groups of organisms that contained studies that have received a lot of publicity and were sub- jected to EFSA reassessments (natural enemies, non-target Lepidoptera, and water-dwelling organisms). The choice of honeybees as a starting point of the analysis was guided by their importance as pollinators, and by the elevated scientific and popular media attention, they are currently receiving due to their dramatic decline. The results war- ranted a comparison to another group of organisms to see if the identified shortcomings were only an artefact con- nected to the work on the honeybee group. Subsequently, I chose earthworms for assessment due to their importance for soil processes and widespread cultural awareness of them as important organisms when compared to other soil organisms considered in the assessment.

framework for evaluating the quality and use of sci- ence for policy [33]. The analysis consists of three steps. In the first step, I assess the reliability of the scientific studies cited in the Opinion. The second step follows with an assessment of the way in which the scientific information was used in the synthesis in the Opinion. By combining these two steps, I then arrive at an evalu- ation of the adequacy and appropriateness of the Pan- el’s conclusions. A detailed description of the analysis follows.
Reliability rating
To guide the first step, the critical evaluation of the reli- ability of the cited studies, Wickson [33] suggests ask- ing four general questions: “Who performed the study? Where was the study performed? How was the study performed? What now?”. After collecting answers to all these questions, I created three specific catego- ries within which I determined scales for ranking the strength of reliability, as outlined in more detail below and summarised in Table 1. The reliability is ranked according to good scientific standards (for the categories affiliation and support, status of the study) and a gen- eral principle of ecological relevance (category event). The ranking scale also included examples (e.g., industry in the affiliation and support category) that were not found in this analysis, but which might be identified in other risk assessments. Others performing a reliability rating might choose other categories or rank the values differently reflecting what they consider as relevant and important for the risk assessment. In the following, the categories, the scales, and the rationale for their order are explained.
Category: Affiliation and support
Question: “What was the affiliation of the authors and where did financial support for the study come from?”
Rationale for the order: Reliability rises with increasing independence from the industry producing or marketing GM crops as this poses a conflict of interest. Moreover, industry dossiers have been criticised for an inadequate ERA [6, 9, 35].
• Public universities and public research institutes
• Various including industry and/or applicant mixed affiliation and/or support of the study, which includes a company that produces and/or markets GM crops in general or the specific GM crop assessed in the
Opinion
• Industry the study and/or the funding originates
from a company which produces and/or markets GM
crops
• Applicant the study and/or the funding originates
from the company which produces and/or markets the specific GM crop assessed in the Opinion.
Category: Status of the study
Question: “What is the status of the study?”
Rationale for the order: First, I ordered reliability in this category according to the published or unpublished sta- tus of a study, with a higher ranking for the former. In general, peer-reviewed studies have a higher reliability than un-reviewed. The last distinction which I made was between original research studies bringing a new body of evidence and meta-analyses or reviews building on results of others. Original studies were assessed as hav- ing a higher level of reliability. Although a meta-analysis often has higher credibility than single original studies, it is not the case in the present study. This is because the meta-analysis cited in the Opinion [36] involved various Cry proteins, while only four studies used the Cry1Ab protein expressed in MON810. The use of reviews is questionable as the Opinion itself is a kind of a review

Chvátalová Environ Sci Eur (2019) 31:52

and should arguably refer to original literature, where possible.
• Original research, peer-reviewed, published
• Review/meta-analysis, peer-reviewed, published
• Un-reviewed, published
• Un-reviewed, unpublished.
5
Rationale for the order: The properties of the cry pro- tein, and thus the risk it might pose, may differ dramati- cally between the distinct cry proteins [37]. Similarly, the expression of the protein in different crops and even differ- ent maize events can lead to different effects [37]. There- fore, the reliability of studies rises when they use specific Cry1Ab events and the specific event assessed here.
• MON810 the specific Bt maize assessed
• Other Cry1Ab maize other maize event, one that
expresses the same protein as the assessed event
• Other Cry1Ab crop other crop than maize that
expresses the same protein as the assessed event
• Other Cry crop other crop than maize that expresses
other cry protein than Cry1Ab.
For two other categories (location and test material), I did not determine scales for ranking the strength of reli- ability. However, I noted the proportion of studies within specific categories of methodology cited in the Opinion.
I differentiate among laboratory, semi-field, and field studies within or outside Europe within the category “loca- tion” answering the question “Where was the experiment conducted?”. The EFSA guidance for applicants effective at the time of the preparation of the Opinion suggests that field trials may not be required if experiments under controlled laboratory, growth room, or glasshouse condi- tions do not identify sensitivity in exposed species [38]. Nevertheless, Lang et al. strongly advocate field or semi- field tests regardless of early tier results, because the plant- ing of GM crops in different biogeographical regions can result in different ecological consequences and because they regard most laboratory studies as overly simplistic [39]. Therefore, I note the proportion of references citing laboratory and field studies taking into consideration the reported effects on the NTOs that were tested.
A differentiation among purified Cry1ab protein, plant material, and the whole plant is made within the category
5 A unique transformation of a plant by insertion of a particular transgene into its genome.
“test material” answering the question “What test material wasused?”.TheuseofGMplantsandtheirproductsissug- gested for the first tier in the EFSA guidance [38]. Andow and Hilbeck argue that for an adequate ERA for NTOs, both long-term exposure to the transgene product and whole-plant tests are needed [40]. Spök et al. recommend the use of whole GM plants to account for the “differences between plant and bacterially produced proteins as well as host plant composition” [35]. I, therefore, note the propor- tion of references citing experiments with bacterially pro- duced proteins, plant material, and whole plants.
Reflective questioning
The second step of the analysis was focused on assessing the ways in which scientific information from the cited studies was used by the Panel. In this procedure, I was inspired by the questions suggested by Wickson [33] and, therefore, reflected on how the scientific study was pre- sented, the accurateness of the references, the represen- tation of the study’s methods and results, if information was selected and how, if critique was applied and how, what uncertainties and assumptions were embedded in the study, and whether they were communicated.
The shortcomings that were identified formed a pat- tern similar to the one previously found by Wickson [33]; therefore, I adopted her categories of misuse of scientific information. These included: Lack of critique: an uncriti- cal reporting of the study and its results; Misleading pres- entation: a style of presentation that misleadingly suggests a higher strength in evidence than actually exists; Mis- quotation: an inaccurate citation of a study in support of a statement; Selection of information: information from a study only being selectively reported in the assessment; Inconsistent presentation: the results of a study being cited differently in various parts of the assessment; Qualifica- tions removed: the study specifically indicating that fur- ther research is required, but this is not reported in the assessment; Misrepresentation: an inaccurate citation of a study’s method. I also added a category: Irrelevant critique: study subjected to critique that does not corre- spond to the content of the original study. Examples of each category will be described in the results.
Evaluation of the adequacy and appropriateness
of the conclusions
Finally, I evaluated if the conclusions made by the Panel for each section of NTOs corresponded to the findings from literature through combining the results from the assessment of the reliability of the studies and the way they were used.
In accordance with the aim of the study, the reliability, the use of science, and the adequacy and appropriate- ness of the conclusions were compared to the state of

Evaluation of completeness of scientific information
In addition, I examined whether the Opinion omitted relevant scientific information that was available before its promulgation. This was done by searching the Web of Science, Scopus, Proquest Central, and CAB Direct scientific databases. For details of search queries and results, refer to Table 2.

Honeybees: The reliability of the cited studies
Here, an assessment of the reliability of the studies cited in the Opinion is provided (the first part of the analysis). In the section dealing with possible risks to honeybees, eight scientific works are cited in the Opinion. Overall, the scientific information stems from reliable sources, but the reliability of the studies themselves varies (Fig. 1).

All of the cited studies were peer-reviewed and pub- lished. Five original research studies, two reviews, and one meta-analysis were used. The affiliation of the authors and financial support for the studies is pre- dominantly of a public character. Only two studies were authored by researchers affiliated to public institutions and industry in collaboration. The meta-analysis [36] was written by authors employed by universities and Mon- santo, the company which developed markets and holds a patent on the MON810 maize. Various stakeholders including companies developing GM plant applications at the EU level contributed to the review of information in the BEETLE report [41].
The ecological reliability was not assessed for the two reviews and the meta-analysis because of mixed informa- tion in the studies that were employed. Four of the five original studies explored the hazard to honeybees. Only one also employed, along with the laboratory experi- ments, a field trial in USA [42]. Another three studies were performed only in the laboratory [43–45]. Intact Bt maize plants and plant material were used only in one study, which was performed with another Cry1Ab maize event (Bt11) [42]. Pollen from MON810 event was used in one study [45], while purified cry toxin was used in three cases [43–45]. One original study aimed to estimate the exposure of honeybee larvae to the toxin in pollen by conducting European semi-field trials with non-GM maize plants [46].
In conclusion, the scientific information cited in the Honeybees section comes predominantly from sources of high reliability in terms of authorship and financial sup- port (six out of eight studies) and the status of the study (five out of eight). The ecological reliability of the stud- ies for which the assessment of methods was possible was
medium. Although both laboratory and (semi-)field stud- ies were cited, no field or semi-field study that employed the actual event MON810 that was assessed was con- ducted. Honeybees were exposed both to the purified toxin and whole plants or plant material. However, only one study used plant material from MON810 maize.
Honeybees: The misuse of scientific information
in the Opinion
This section describes how the cited scientific informa- tion was used in the EFSA’s Opinion [3]. The identified shortcomings are summarised in the use of science cat- egories and indicated in Table 3.
Misquotation
In the section assessing the risks to honeybees, three studies are cited [42–44] by EFSA to support the state- ment that Bt maize/Cry1Ab protein causes “no direct adverse effects on larvae and adult survival” [3] which is true only for adults as none of the studies used larval stages. Thus, the Opinion makes a broader claim than that which can be supported by the cited evidence.
Selection of information
From other cited works, information is chosen selec- tively. Only parameters that were not affected are men- tioned: “no significant differences were reported in honeybee mortality, syrup consumption and olfactory learning performance” [3], while the one that was nega- tively influenced is omitted: “foraging activity decreased during and after exposure to Cry1Ab protein” [43]. The authors of this study concluded that “negative effects of Cry1Ab protein on bees cannot be excluded over time.”

[43]; however, this is also left out of the EFSA Opinion [3].
Misquotation and qualifications removed
The Opinion continues by concluding that negative effects on foraging behaviour and learning performance are unlikely, despite the fact that the cited study [44] did not explore the effects of the Cry1Ab protein on foraging behaviour. The authors report instead “disturbances in the feeding behaviours” and the “potential effect of suble- thal doses of Cry1Ab on learning performance”, and note that this may be unlikely to occur under natural condi- tions, stressing the need for further research [44].
Selection of information and misrepresentation
Similarly, the study of Rose and colleagues [42] is pre- sented in the Opinion as a field study, which omits labo- ratory experiments that revealed a difference between the Bt and non-Bt treatment: “More non-Bt than Bt pollen was consumed per bee.” [42]. Although the study authors attribute the difference to pollen quality, the significance of this and the possible negative effect of Bt protein on feeding behaviour cannot be excluded, especially in the context of other cited studies.
From the study of Babendreier et al. [45], only the results for the development of the hypopharyngeal glands are presented in the Opinion, leaving out other relevant information from the study. Another aim of that study was to investigate if the glands could take up ingested transgene products [45]. Traces of Cry1Ab protein were
detected in the glands, leading the authors to conclude that the protein is unlikely to be transferred to larvae or, if so, in small amounts [45]. The Opinion thus again uses the information selectively and fails to address other pos- sible routes of exposure.
Earthworms: The reliability of the cited studies
Fourteen scientific works are cited in the section dealing with possible risks to earthworms in the Opinion. They are of reliable origin and overall of medium reliability (Fig. 2). The reliability of one study was not assessed as the content was irrelevant for the risk assessment [47].
The vast majority of cited studies were authored by researchers affiliated with universities or public research institutions and financially supported by public sources, making them receive a high reliability rating within this category. Only one review was prepared by various stake- holders, including industry [41]. All the cited studies were subjected to the peer-review process and published. Nine of the studies presented original research results, while four were reviews [37, 41, 48, 49]. The ecological reliability was not assessed for the reviews because of mixed information in the studies that were employed.
Seven cited sources which focused on hazard identifi- cation used either whole plants (four out of seven) [50– 53] or plant material (five out of seven) [50, 51, 54–56] in European fields (three out of seven) [52, 53, 55] or under laboratory conditions (five out of seven) [50, 51, 54–56]. The MON810 event was employed in the majority of the studies (five out of seven) [50, 52–54, 56], and other

Cry1Ab maize was used too (four out of seven studies) [51, 52, 55, 56].
Two studies elaborating on the release of cry toxin from root exudates and its persistence in soil were performed under laboratory and, in USA, semi-field conditions with whole plants and plant material from MON810 and other Cry1Ab maize [57, 58].
In conclusion, the scientific information cited in the Earthworms section is from predominantly reliable sources: 12 out of 13 relevant studies are of public ori- gin (both authorship and financial support) and 9 out of 13 studies are original research articles. The ecologi- cal reliability of the original studies is high owing to the balanced ratio of laboratory and field experiments, use of plant material, and, mostly, the MON810 event that was assessed. Two studies used whole MON810 plants under European field conditions.
Earthworms: The misuse of scientific information
in the Opinion
The purpose of this section is to illustrate the categories of respective shortcomings identified in the use of sci- entific information by EFSA in the risk assessment for
earthworms [3]. Therefore, I describe only selected cases here, for further results please refer to Additional file 1. The summary of use of science is provided in Table 4.
Misquotation
The EFSA Opinion cites an irrelevant study [47] to sup- port a statement about how Cry1Ab protein enters soil by plant material. Webster and colleagues [47] investi- gated the chemical composition and decomposition of birch and conventional maize pollen in soil. No link can be traced to the source of the Cry1Ab protein from plant material on the basis of this study. To make sure that it was not a citation error, the Web of Science database was searched, but did not reveal any study authored by Webster that could be cited to support the statement as it appears in the Opinion.
Inconsistent presentation
The Opinion cites several studies [50, 51, 54–56] to sup- port the claim that “laboratory studies performed on some earthworm species (...) did not reveal significant adverse effects” [3]. Nevertheless, among these stud- ies are two [50, 55] that reported negative effects on

reproduction and weight in adult earthworms from feed- ing on Bt maize leaves, respectively. The introductory claim, therefore, is simplistic and misleading.
Lack of critique
The negative findings reported by Vercesi et al. [50] are presented only later in the Opinion text, where each of the cited studies is discussed. It seems, however, that the original interpretation of the results by the authors was uncritically adopted by EFSA. EFSA along with Vercesi et al. [50] consider the concentration of Bt biomass in soil in which the negative effect was observed as rela- tively high and, therefore, question the ecological signifi- cance of the effect under natural conditions. However, this reasoning is based on erroneous assumptions. The estimation of exposure of earthworms to the toxin only considers the amount of the cry protein from Bt maize leaves left in the soil while omitting other routes of expo- sure to the protein (e.g., other parts of maize plants, root exudates, and wildlife faeces). Furthermore, Vercesi et al. [50] assume a shorter persistence of the protein in soil, although evidence of its accumulation [57] and longer degradation times [59] exists and is cited in the study itself and in the Opinion.
Further examples of lack of critique will be discussed in this papers’ section “Earthworms: The adequacy and appropriateness of the conclusions”.
Misquotation
Although the findings of negative effects on the weight of adult earthworms observed by Zwahlen et al. [55] are dis- cussed further in the Opinion, the results are represented imprecisely. According to EFSA “the growth of adults (...) significantly declined thereafter in Bt-exposed earth- worms up to 200 days.” [3], whereas Zwahlen et al. [55] indicate more importantly, that after 200 days, Bt maize- fed earthworms lost weight, whereas non-Bt maize-fed earthworms gained weight.
Furthermore, the study is incorrectly cited to support parameters that were not examined by the authors: “The ingestion of the Cry1Ab protein by earthworms was confirmed through the detection of the protein in their gut and faeces (e.g., Zwahlen et al. [59]).” [3]. Probably, another study [51] was meant instead, where the cry pro- tein was determined in the gut and faeces of L. terrestris. Similarly, Zwahlen et al. [55] did not perform field sur- veys “during the cultivation of Bt-maize” [3], as the Opin- ion suggests, but used dried Bt maize leaves instead.
Selection of information
The Opinion lists possible explanations of the observed effect of weight loss, which agree with those discussed by Zwahlen et al. [55]. However, another possible
explanation indicated by the authors is omitted. Accord- ing to them [55], significantly higher lignin content in the Bt maize variety used in their experiments and reported by [60] could lead to “a delayed litter degrada- tion and decomposition by microbes or to a lower nutri- tional quality for earthworms in the long term.”, an effect deserving further attention.
Critique
Interestingly, it is the study that reported a negative effect [55] where EFSA applies the second of only two critiques of the cited science. EFSA appropriately criticises that the authors did not quantify the reproductive activity recorded during the experiment, which would allow for a potential alternative explanation of the weight loss due to “differences in timing or production of cocoons in the Bt- maize treatment.” [3]. If true, this explanation could have been, however, considered itself as an adverse effect and would have needed yet another explanation.

Finally, when discussing the findings reported by Zwahlen et al. [55], the GMO Panel concludes that: “it is not possible to make any inference on long-term effects on natural populations” [3], without calling for any fur- ther research. This was despite the fact that the authors of the cited study claimed that longer experiments were necessary and recommended further research to include other life history traits and fitness parameters, the use of newly hatched juveniles, and species common for areas with the respective GM crop.
Misquotation and qualifications removed
In the Opinion, the study of Clark and Coats [56] is incorrectly cited as having found no negative effects on the reproduction of earthworms, an impact that was not actually examined in the study. This parameter was examined in only one cited study [50] and in one spe- cies, Aporrectodea caliginosa. The adverse effect on the cocoon hatchability rate, which decreased significantly with increasing Bt concentration, as reported by the authors, is considered by EFSA to be questionable under natural conditions. The Opinion statement citing Clark and Coats [56] that there is no negative impact on repro- duction is incorrect and counter to the findings of Vercesi et al. [50], who recommend further research with earth- worms in field experiments under long-term cultivation.
Irrelevant critique
The Opinion criticises the assessment of growth in adult earthworms purportedly performed in the study of Sax- ena and Stotzky [51]. Interestingly, the review by Clark et al. [37] cited in the Opinion also notes that the use of

Chvátalová Environ Sci Eur (2019) 31:52
Page 12 of 17
growth in adult earthworms in this study [51] was proba- bly not an appropriate assessment endpoint [37]. It seems that EFSA adopted this critique without referring to the original article [51]. The authors of that article described lack of effects on survival and weight and actually made no conclusions about growth of earthworms [51]. The critique is, therefore, irrelevant and the representation of the study imprecise.
Misleading presentation
The results of the research project “Monitoring of the environmental effects of the Bt gene” [52] are imprecisely represented, suggesting a greater strength in evidence for no effects on the population density or biomass of Lumb- ricidae. The statement in the Opinion that no differences between Bt and non-Bt-maize soils were reported “(...) at 5 sites during 4 years of maize cultivation in field” [3] could be interpreted as if sampling had been undertaken at multiple places per year in the course of 4 years. How- ever, the sampling was performed once at each site in the second year or third year of the 4-year cultivation period [52].
Discussion
Honeybees: The adequacy and appropriateness
of the conclusions
EFSA concludes that “...the likelihood of adverse effects on honeybees is expected to be very low.” [3]. This conclu- sion is based on information from eight scientific works stemming from sources of high reliability and medium ecological reliability. Nevertheless, taking into account the three studies reporting negative effects, the ecological reliability of the body of evidence is insufficient as a result of the lack of higher tier studies. Although both labora- tory and (semi-)field studies using purified Cry1Ab pro- tein, and in one case, plant material from MON810 were cited, no (semi-)field study employed the MON810 event that was assessed.
The Opinion admits only one possible route of expo- sure of honeybees to the Cry1Ab protein which is through pollen [41]. Other exposure pathways such as nectar [61] and possibly worker jelly [45] are left out.
Five original research studies, one review and one meta-analysis are used to assess the hazards and expo- sure of honeybee larvae and adults to the Cry1Ab pro- tein. A close look reveals, however, that larval stages are addressed in only two studies, both of which are pre- sented in the meta-analysis by Duan et al. [36]. Interest- ingly, the Opinion only cites the meta-analysis for these studies’ findings and not the original sources. The meta- analysis focused on various cry proteins and life stages,
but only four studies exposed honeybees to the Cry1Ab protein: larvae were used in a peer-reviewed and pub- lished study not cited in the Opinion [62] and in an unpublished study by Monsanto (Maggi and Sims, cited in [36]); and adults in a study cited in the Opinion [42] and another unpublished study by Monsanto (Maggi and Sims, cited in [36]). Although meta-analyses are usually attributed a higher credibility than single studies, the use of the study by Duan et al. [36] is of questionable value for the Opinion assessment as it analyses 25 studies that used various cry proteins, but only four studies exposed honeybees to the Cry1Ab protein expressed in MON810. Furthermore, half of the experiments cited are non-peer- reviewed studies issued either by the US Environmental Protection Agency or the Monsanto Company. The first and third authors of the meta-analysis have a conflict of interests, being employed by Monsanto, which produces and markets Bt crops. Though clearly declared in the original paper, none of these limitations are reflected in the Opinion.
Adverse effects were observed in three of four cited original research studies that exposed honeybees to puri- fied Cry1Ab protein and/or plant material. However, in the Opinion the negative effects of the Cry1Ab protein on feeding behaviour and possibly on learning perfor- mance are left out [42–44]. Only negative impacts pre- sented by Ramirez-Romero et al. [44] as being unlikely to occur under natural conditions are cited in the Opinion. The authors of all the original studies, in contrast, sug- gest that negative effects cannot be excluded and call for further research [42–44]. EFSA’s selective use of informa- tion does not fulfil the requirements of good scientific practice.
Selective reporting of results in the Opinion seems to be based on the assumption that adverse effects will not occur in nature. This belief assumes a known and sta- ble concentration of the Cry1Ab protein produced by plants and that pollen is the only source of the protein. Both suppositions were being questioned at the time the assessment was performed, even in some studies cited in the Opinion [45, 61, 63, 64]. Moreover, a negative effect was also observed using pollen from Bt11 maize [42], which expresses the Cry1Ab protein at a comparable concentration to the assessed event MON810 [3]. The assessment is further based on studies using bacterially produced purified Cry1Ab protein. Such studies assume interchangeability of surrogate proteins with plant pro- teins and assume no differences between the conven- tional and GM plants, except for the presence of the novel Bt protein. These assumptions are challenged in the scientific literature [35, 65] including a study cited in the Opinion by Clark and Coats [56].

The conclusion continues with a generalisation: “The EFSA GMO Panel has no reason to consider that maize MON810 will cause reductions to pollinating insects...” [3]. The whole section concerns, however, research on one species exclusively: the honeybee. Studies testing other pollinating species that are available are lacking in the Opinion, and thus, the general conclusion on polli- nating insects is unwarranted.
A literature search for further relevant works not cited in the Opinion revealed three articles that present addi- tional information or provide further support for claims that are insufficiently backed in the Opinion. For exam- ple, the wrongly supported claim of no adverse effects on larvae survival could cite the study of Hanley and col- leagues, who report “no effect on honey bee larval mor- tality, pupal mortality, pupal weight, or haemolymph protein concentration” compared to controls [62]. Baben- dreier et al. [66] provide further information concern- ing a potential hazard to honeybees not discussed in the Opinion: “Neither Bt-maize pollen nor high concentra- tions of Cry1Ab significantly affected bacterial communi- ties in honeybee intestines.”. The third study showed that neither feeding honeybees with pollen from a Cry1Ab maize nor contact with its tassels had an effect on honey bee mortality [67].
The additionally identified studies are of equivalent quality to the cited ones, i.e., original research articles, peer-reviewed, published, and using maize producing the Cry1Ab protein or the protein itself. Two of them were included in the cited review [68] and one in the meta- analysis [36]. In these cases, the Opinion referred to secondary literature instead of using original sources of information.
By omitting relevant studies, misquoting, and selec- tively citing results, the GMO Panel failed to perform a thorough, high-quality, risk assessment for honeybees. They conclude that: “... the likelihood of adverse effects on honeybees is expected to be very low. The EFSA GMO Panel has no reason to consider that maize MON810 will cause reductions to pollinating insects that are signifi- cantly greater from those caused by conventional farm- ing.” [3].
A more nuanced and evidence-based conclusion drawn from the studies that are cited and omitted could read: “The risk assessment for honeybees could not be com- pleted because of the lack of essential data. Further research is needed to confirm the ecological relevance of adverse effects on feeding behaviour and learning per- formance reported in laboratory studies. The risk assess- ment for other pollinating insects could not be completed because of the lack of essential data.”.
Earthworms: The adequacy and appropriateness
of the conclusions
In the Opinion, the conclusion of the section on earth- worms reads: “The EFSA GMO Panel is of the opinion that there is no evidence to indicate that the placing of maize MON810 and derived products on the market is likely to cause adverse effects on earthworms in the con- text of its proposed use.” [3]. It cites four reviews, nine original research studies, and one study not relevant for the assessment. Although the scientific information stems from generally reliable sources (authors affiliations and financial support) and the ecological reliability of the studies is high, the use of the information by EFSA in the Opinion is problematic. Studies are often misquoted and information selectively used. The Opinion does not require any further research, which contrasts with the recommendation by two cited studies [55, 56] and the cited findings of negative effects from Bt maize on repro- duction and weight [50, 55]. The literature search did not reveal any additional relevant studies for the ERA of earthworms.
The Opinion lists a few sources of the Cry1Ab pro- tein in soil, but does not include others from the faeces of wildlife and livestock and effluents from biogas facili- ties as reported in a cited report [41]. On the other hand, a cited exposure route of earthworms to the protein through plant material is wrongly supported by an irrel- evant study [47].
The authors of the Opinion fail to reflect and critique the methods and results of the cited studies. Neverthe- less, a critique could be applied, e.g., to the duration of the experiments and choice of the test organisms. In vir- tually all of the cited studies (except for [55] which per- formed a 200-day experiment), the exposure time was short (ranging from 28 to 98 days) compared to the life spans of earthworms, which generally live for more than 4 years in the laboratory and approximately 1 year in nat- ural surroundings (Edwards, as cited in [69]).
Moreover, the relevance of particular test species for arable land could be questioned. Only two of the cited studies [50, 54] used the most appropriate species, A. caliginosa, which is abundant in European agricultural soils [52, 70]. Others used Eisenia fetida [56], a species scarce in agricultural soils preferring areas with high amounts of organic matter or Lumbricus terrestris [51, 54, 55] for which the evidence of occurrence in these soils is ambiguous.
Criticism was applied only to that study which reported an adverse effect [55] or adopted from a review in which the study’s method was criticised, even though the critique was irrelevant [51]. The widespread

Chvátalová Environ Sci Eur (2019) 31:52
Page 14 of 17
lack of critique or its inappropriate application does not inspire confidence in the scientific rigour of the EFSA.
Four studies examined the effects of Bt maize plant material on adults and three on juveniles in laboratory and/or field conditions. The exposure had no effect on earthworm survival and growth, and the population density, number of species, and biomass of Lumbrici- dae. However, according to Vercesi et al. [50], Bt maize residues had a negative impact on cocoon hatchability. The relevance of this effect under natural conditions is questioned by the authors and EFSA and field experi- ments to confirm the results which are recommended by the authors but not by EFSA. Significant weight loss in Bt maize-fed earthworms was observed by Zwahlen et al. [55]. These authors conclude that sublethal long- term effects cannot be excluded and further research is needed. In the Opinion, studies reporting negative effects are either criticised or the ecological relevance thereof is questioned, diminishing the results. The find- ings of adverse effects thus do not find their way into the conclusion.
The report by Bartsch et al. [41] cited several times in the Opinion concludes that the likelihood of effects on non-target organisms due to accumulation of toxic compounds is “low for Bt maize, but uncertainties remain concerning long-term effects on soil NTOs and soil ecological functions and concerning effects of spe- cific Bt proteins if Bt maize is cultivated continuously on same fields” [41]. Although earthworms are not explicitly mentioned there, EFSA communicates the uncertainties about soil organisms in neither any sec- tion relating to soil organisms nor in the overall conclu- sion of the Opinion.
By failing to indicate uncertainties, to apply critique to all studies’ methods, misquoting and selectively citing results, the GMO Panel did not perform a thorough or reliable risk assessment for earthworms. Their conclu- sion in the Opinion reads: “The EFSA GMO Panel is of the opinion that there is no evidence to indicate that the placing of maize MON810 and derived products on the market is likely to cause adverse effects on earthworms in the context of its proposed use.” [3].
A more appropriate conclusion based on the studies that are cited could read: “The risk assessment for earth- worms could not be completed because of the lack of essential data. Further research is needed to confirm the ecological relevance of adverse effects on reproduction and weight in adult earthworms reported in laboratory studies.”
Overall discussion
The critical evaluation of the risk assessment for the two groups of non-target organisms shows that the scientific
information that is cited comes predominantly from reliable sources and that the ecological reliability of the studies is medium. However, the body of evidence in both groups is insufficient to draw conclusions on risk, particularly in the context of reported adverse effects in lower tier experiments. The GMO Panel, nonetheless, arrived at the conclusion that “...the likelihood of adverse effects on non-target organisms or on ecological func- tions [is expected to be] very low...” [3]. Furthermore, the results of my research indicate the following failures by the EFSA GMO Panel: selective use of information, neglect of relevant available studies, misquotation of studies, failure to acknowledge uncertainties, to call for further research where needed, and to critically interpret studies. These results are consistent with the current lit- erature [8, 13, 22–26].
Limitations of the study
This study examined the risk assessment for two out of ten groups of non-target organisms performed by EFSA. The results of the two selected groups showed a similar pattern regarding the reliability of scientific sources and the use of scientific information, allowing me to conclude that the identified shortcomings were not accidental. It has been argued that EFSA subjected studies report- ing adverse effects on other NTOs (e.g., lady beetles, lacewing larvae, Lepidoptera, and Daphnia magna) to a higher level of scrutiny [26, 71]. Therefore, as stated in the Methods, I did not choose to evaluate other groups of NTOs assessed in the Opinion that contain highly debated studies (natural enemies, non-target Lepidop- tera, and water-dwelling organisms). However, I encour- age others to evaluate other elements of the ERA. Various reviewers can have different views and priorities guiding their analysis, and thus enrich the knowledge base of the ERA used for decision-making.
The reliability of the studies was ranked according to a general principle of ecological relevance and good scientific standards. As mentioned in the Methods sec- tion, others performing a reliability rating might choose other categories or rank the values differently based on what they see as relevant and important for a high- quality ERA. However, in my view, it would not invali- date the current analysis, but would rather broaden the risk assessment and further illustrate that science-based decision-making is inherently interwoven with values and judgments that affect, for example, judgements con- cerning what constitutes quality and reliability in science for policy.
The aim of this critical evaluation was not to perform a “true risk assessment”, but rather to help increase the robustness of advice for future decision-making on GMOs by demonstrating the inherent flexibility in how

Page 15 of 17
science is interpreted. Further research would reveal if the identified shortcomings were specific to this case or characterise a more widespread pattern of behaviour.
Conclusions
According to EFSA’s own words, the Authority aims to “provide high-quality scientific advice based on the expertise of its network of scientists and staff and the quality of its science-based information and methodolo- gies, which are grounded in internationally recognised standards.” [10].
The results of this extended review of a section of the Scientific Opinion issued by the EFSA GMO Panel show that the science-based information used in the Opinion originates predominantly from reliable sources, with authors affiliated mostly to public sector and financial support for the studies coming from public resources. All cited studies have been peer reviewed and pub- lished, two-thirds are original research articles and one- third is constituted by reviews and a meta-analysis. The overall ecological reliability of the studies is medium. Although the results from experiments under labora- tory and (semi-)field conditions with purified toxin and whole plants or plant material were reported, no (semi-) field honeybee study employed the MON810 event that was assessed and only two earthworm studies used whole MON810 plants under European field conditions. The duration of the experiments and choice of the test organ- isms, particularly in the earthworms’ section, make these studies less reliable.
However, how the Panel uses the scientific informa- tion was particularly concerning and indicates the opposite of “high-quality scientific advice”. Studies are often misquoted, using a wrong citation or representing the results and methods imprecisely. Information from the studies is used selectively, in particular leaving out negative effects and further research requirements. Cri- tique is only selectively applied, once to a study report- ing a negative sublethal effect on earthworms and in the second case borrowed from another source and applied inadequately. Critical reflection on the methods used in all cited studies would allow for more balanced assessment. Similarly, EFSA does not communicate any uncertainties, although these are sometimes explicitly stated in the cited literature, and does not provide its own reflection on the relevance of the results under natural conditions. Moreover, the cited information is not comprehensive, as evidenced by additional relevant articles found through a literature search but not used in the Opinion.
The body of referenced evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on risk, especially taking into account the reported adverse effects on honeybees
and earthworms in lower tier experiments. Thus, the following conclusions of the GMO Panel are inappro- priate and misleading: “... the likelihood of adverse effects on honeybees is expected to be very low. The EFSA GMO Panel has no reason to consider that maize MON810 will cause reductions to pollinating insects that are significantly greater from those caused by con- ventional farming.” and “...there is no evidence to indi- cate that the placing of maize MON810 and derived products on the market is likely to cause adverse effects on earthworms in the context of its proposed use.” [3]. More robust and evidence-based conclusions drawn from the cited studies and additional relevant ones could read: “The risk assessment for honeybees could not be completed because of the lack of essential data. Further research is needed to confirm the ecological relevance of adverse effects on feeding behaviour and learning performance reported in laboratory studies. The risk assessment for other pollinating insects could not be completed because of the lack of essential data. The risk assessment for earthworms could not be com- pleted because of the lack of essential data. Further research is needed to confirm the ecological relevance of adverse effects on reproduction and weight in adult earthworms reported in laboratory studies.”.
My results add to the substantial body of research that has demonstrated that EFSA’s claim to scientific excel- lence is seriously compromised [8, 13, 22–26, 71]. As a result, EFSA’s credibility in scientific assessment of GM crops can no longer be safely relied upon.
Those responsible for food safety, and indeed food security, within the EU would be well advised to recon- sider the scientific reliability of the advice given by EFSA in this area and to seek alternative and, perhaps, less complacent sources of advice.
Relevantly, these results would support the call on the EC to withdraw its Draft implementing decision to renew the authorisation of MON810 cultivation voiced by the European Parliament and NGOs, criticising among oth- ers the incomplete environmental risk assessment by EFSA [31, 72, 73].

bacterial, and fungal pathogens, parasitic weeds, and insect vectors of plant pathogens. We con- clude that there will be no shortage of GE applications to tackle disease resistance and other farmer and consumer priorities for agricultural crops. Beyond reviewing scientific prospects for genetically engineered crops, we address the social institutional forces that are commonly over- looked by biological scientists. Intellectual property regimes, technology regulatory frameworks, the balance of funding between public- and private-sector research, and advocacy by concerned civil society groups interact to define who uses which GE technologies, on which crops, and for the benefit of whom. Ensuring equitable access to the benefits of genetically engineered crops requires affirmative policies, targeted investments, and excellent science.
INTRODUCTION
In the earliest days of plant genetic engineering (GE), there was no shortage of enthusiasm and ambition to apply this exciting new technology to agriculture. One striking example of such a broad vision is seen in Barton &amp; Brill (12), who foresaw GE targets for crop improvement: mod- ified seed proteins to enhance nutritional value, nitrogen fixation to reduce use of nitrogen fer- tilizers, improved photosynthesis to increase productivity, and increased stress tolerance and pest and pathogen resistance to reduce crop losses and production costs and improve environmental safety. However, 36 years later, few of these dreams have come true. This may be in part because these dreams focused on humanitarian and environmental sustainability goals that were difficult to monetize, whereas those who commercialized genetically engineered crops had to turn a rela- tively quick profit while complying with complex and costly regulations. The early successes were mostly made by companies focused on simple traits for big markets, i.e., herbicide or insect re- sistance for major row crops. However, one small nonprofit team developed and commercialized the first pathogen-resistant perennial crop: the Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV)-resistant papaya (43), which was credited with saving the papaya industry in Hawaii. Yet, despite the obvious potential, in 2019 there are still few examples of pathogen-resistant genetically engineered crops on the market.
Several novel GE technologies are particularly exciting because they are relatively simple, ac- curate, and affordable to apply, making them useful to address challenges and opportunities for the crops of resource-poor farmers and underserved consumers (11, 151). Newer GE technolo- gies, notably gene editing, are now reaching maturity and their social acceptance and regulatory protocols are still being forged (66). The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) determined in March 2018 that single-gene knockouts or single base-pair mutations via genome editing would not be regulated by the agency (137). Although this decision offered reason for optimism among those developing genetically engineered crops in the United States, the US Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rulings are yet to come (103). A precautionary approach to regulating products of gene editing was taken by the Euro- pean Court of Justice in July 2018 (33), whereas a month later, the Japanese government ruling recommended that gene-edited plants without foreign nucleotides should not be regulated (138). Heavy commercial and academic research investments by China suggest no reticence to create or use gene-edited crops (23), whereas India is debating the issue (1). It is unknown how African and other societies will decide to regulate novel GE technologies.
In this review, we consider how GE technologies can contribute to crops that meet the chal- lenges of provisioning the world with food, feed, fiber, medicines, aesthetics, ecological controls, and structural materials, with an emphasis on crop pathogen resistance. The world requires in- creasing agricultural production to meet food and feed demands of a growing population with

  rising incomes (3, 133). These demands coincide with growing awareness of the environmental footprint of agriculture and the need to adapt farming and consumer practices to ensure sustain- ability of production (115). Moreover, expected changes in global climate (64) will modify the range and severity of pest and disease outbreaks (15) and affect yields and yield stability (96).
The greatest burden of these converging challenges will fall on the poor, and especially the poor in tropical, net food-importing countries (13, 35). Therefore, we first explore the potential current and future benefits of genetically engineered crops, especially for controlling plant pathogens of crops that are staples or otherwise crucial to farmers and consumers in lower-income countries. Reflecting on the many factors beyond science and technology that complicate delivery and de- ployment of genetically engineered crops for plant protection, we then discuss social drivers, chal- lenges, and opportunities affecting whether farmers and consumers, especially the poor or those in small markets or of minor crops, will benefit from them.
SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK FOR GENETICALLY ENGINEERED DISEASE RESISTANCE IN CROPS
Gene Editing: Genetic Engineering Technology for Today and the Future
Several creative strategies have been used to achieve demonstrable plant resistance to pathogens through gene editing. Editing of plant genes that encode susceptibility factors or negative defense regulators can result in resistance to various pathogens (105). In rice (Oryza sativa), for example, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were used to mutate an effector-binding element in the OsSWEET14 gene and render it nonsusceptible to activation by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) to acquire sugars for its nutritional needs (82). Analogous effects have been achieved for Xanthomonas on other hosts, e.g., cassava and cotton, and demonstrate useful levels of sequence conservation among host genes targeted by the pathogens (34). Naturally occurring mutations of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIF4E and eIF4G), mildew locus O (MLO), and Xa5 and Xa13 genes confer resistance to potyviruses, fungal pathogens, and bacterial pathogens, respectively, by depriving the pathogens of essential host factors (105, 127), and their effects can be replicated by gene editing to create point mutations and partial or complete gene deletions. Baltes et al. (9) demonstrated that the bacterial CRISPR-Cas immunity system can be adapted to protect plants from plant viruses by transforming plants to introduce the CRISPR-Cas reagents, loaded with guide RNA, which is complementary to sequences within multiple viral genomes. Finally, genome-incorporated CRISPR-Cas can be used in regulating gene transcription or to posttranscriptionally target RNA, thereby avoiding editing host genes that may have other essential functions (76).
Knott &amp; Doudna (76) reviewed advances and prospects for using CRISPR-Cas technologies for genetically engineering diverse genomes, including those of plants. Many applications may require the transient or permanent incorporation of the CRISPR-Cas system into the recipient genome. Wang et al. (141) describe how transgenerational CRISPR-Cas9 activity can be used in plant breeding to modify multiple targets or in breeding crosses between lines with and without incor- porated CRISPR-Cas9 constructs, both leading to nontransgenic final products. For improvement of clonal cultivars, e.g., cassava, transient expression or excision of a Cas nuclease may be preferred for limiting intended mutagenesis to a narrow timeframe and maximally maintaining the cultivar’s unique genotype. Nonclonal crops may likewise benefit from using transgene-free genome editing methods (145) to increase precision and, potentially, decrease the regulatory burden.
In reviewing current methods, challenges, and opportunities in applied plant gene editing, Yin et al. (149) noted a great need for (a) nontransgenic CRISPR-Cas enzyme delivery mechanisms

     CASSAVA BROWN STREAK DISEASE
Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is grown on more than 23 million ha across Africa, Asia, and Latin America and provides food and income for more than 800 million people (29). Cassava is the second most important staple crop after maize in sub-Saharan Africa, where 300 million people derive their livelihoods from its production and more than half of the population obtain 10–50% of their caloric intake from it (70, 131).
Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a major emerging disease devastating cassava production in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo and around Lake Tanganyika. Crop damage due to CBSD can reach 70%, and economic damages in Africa are estimated at US$75–100 million annually (88) or higher (95). Two distinct species of ipomoviruses belonging to the family Potyviridae cause CBSD (104) and are vectored by whitefly.
The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in the United States and partners in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda lead the Virus Resistant Cassava for Africa project (132), which addresses the challenges of viral diseases as well as nutritional deficiencies in the storage roots. Stable and strong resistance to CBSD has been achieved using GE, and confined field trials have been conducted in Uganda and Kenya. Cassava with resistance to Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is being conventionally crossed with the CBSD-resistant cassava obtained through GE. Materials produced by this project will be made available to partner countries royalty-free.
and (b) minimization and management of off-target edits. In terms of opportunities, advances in applying bioinformatics and machine learning to explore the growing number of sequenced plant genomes (29) will identify candidate genes or sequences for editing, including some that may achieve broad-spectrum resistance or tolerance to diverse plant pathogens. Some knowledge- based resistances may be applicable across hosts and pathogens, and their deployment across mul- tiple crops will require strategies to maintain their effectiveness by minimizing selection pressure on the pathogens.
Case 1: Genetic Engineering Applications for Disease Control in Cassava
Cassava is an important crop for resource-poor farmers because it grows reasonably well on marginal soils, with unreliable rainfall, and with minimal inputs, and many varieties have a broad time window for harvest that allows staggered harvests to meet food and marketing needs (see the sidebar titled Cassava Brown Streak Disease). Cassava mosaic disease (CMD), caused by at least seven species of geminiviruses, cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), caused by two species of potyviruses, and cassava bacterial blight (CBB), caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam), are widespread in Africa, and although several sources of resistance are known and used in breeding for CMD resistance, only weak or no sources of resistance are available for CBSD and CBB (11). Evidence suggests that the CMD2 resistance gene is negatively regulated in wild-type cassava and that gene editing could stably mutate the negative regulator, making it unavailable for use by the virus for inactivating CMD2 (11). Similar to the above-cited examples (82, 105, 127), targeted mutations of eIF4E and MeSWEET10a in cassava are attractive options for controlling the potyviruses that cause CBSD, and Xam, which causes CBB (11, 52).
Transgenic approaches have also been demonstrated or proposed to control CMD, CBB, and CBSD in cassava (see the sidebar titled Cassava Brown Streak Disease). The effectiveness of RNA interference (RNAi) in controlling Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan CBSV has been demonstrated (17, 139), including partial control using artificial microRNA (amiRNA) (140). Chavarriaga-Aguirre et al. (29) proposed the use of RNAi to interfere with the ability of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) to infect cassava and cause CMD or CBSD, but this approach has not been validated

  (see the section titled Case 4: Genetic Engineering Applications to Control Insect Vectors of Plant Disease Pathogens and the section titled Gene Drives: Incipient and Future Genetic Engineering Technology). Transformation of cassava with a bacterial resistance gene(s) from other species, modified to include an effector-binding element for Xam in their promoter region, could provide resistance to CBB; Hummel et al. (62) demonstrated this approach by adding a stack of effector- binding elements for three strains each of Xoo and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola to the promoter region of rice’s Xa27 bacterial blight resistance gene.
Case 2: Genetic Engineering Applications to Control Aspergillus in Peanut
Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites produced by some fungi of the genus Aspergillus, especially Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are known mutagens and teratogens that can lead to human health problems, including increased risk of liver and kidney cancer, a weak- ened immune system, and failure of infants to gain weight or height as expected (failure to thrive) (77). Aflatoxins are of global importance because they contaminate food crops, including cotton, maize, peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and some tree nuts. Peanuts are widely used in sub-Saharan Africa as a staple food because they are nutrient rich and provide an economical protein source (92). Human exposure also includes contaminated meat and dairy products from animals fed con- taminated crops (77). Although aflatoxin food contamination occurs in both developed and de- veloping countries, people in developing countries experience more exposure, often because of suboptimal processing, storage, and inspection as well as lack of education about the issue (36, 92).
Control of Aspergillus spp. requires multiple tactics during crop production, processing, and storage. Aspergillus-resistant cultivars are desirable for reducing contamination, but conventional breeding has not produced varieties with sufficient resistance to reduce aflatoxins to an acceptable level (122). Therefore, GE approaches may be needed to develop these varieties.
RNAi is an effective approach for pathogen control because genes in the critical pathways for initial infection or spread can be downregulated to prevent disease development in the host (87). Arias et al. (7) demonstrated that silencing of five genes (aflS, alfR, aftC, pes1, and aflep) involved in aflatoxin synthesis and accumulation provided resistance in peanut. Bhatnagar-Mathur et al. (18) proposed that overexpression of lipoxygenase (LOX) genes, which are involved in peanut response to infection by A. parasiticus (91, 126), has the potential to provide resistance to As- pergillus spp. Subsequently, overexpression of two plant-derived antifungal genes, BjNPRI from brown mustard (Brassica juncea) and tgfd from fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), resulted in A. flavus–resistant peanut (129). Sharma et al. (122) combined overexpression of antifungal de- fensin genes (MSDef1 from Medicago sativa and MSDef4.2 from Medicago truncatula) to reduce initial infection, with host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) of aflM and aflP genes in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway to inhibit aflatoxin production in peanut; some products had aflatoxin levels well below US and European Union (EU) limits.
Case 3: Genetic Engineering Applications to Control Parasitic Striga spp. Weeds in Staple Cereals
Members of the genus Striga, commonly known as witchweeds, are parasitic plants in the Oroban- chaceae family that attack a number of monocot and dicot crop species, including maize, sorghum, pearl millet, and rice, all of which are staples for many resource-poor farmers. Striga-caused crop losses affect 56% of sorghum and millet and 15% of maize areas in sub-Saharan Africa (55). Of the 39 African countries producing upland rice, almost 80% have at least one Striga sp. capable of parasitizing rice, with an estimated economic loss of US$117 million per year (116).

Pixley et al.
Control of Striga spp. is difficult because their seeds remain dormant until a host is present and exudes a germination stimulant. After germination, Striga attaches to the host root and forms a haustorium, which allows the parasite to acquire nutrients and water. Neither traditional breeding nor weed management techniques have provided sufficient Striga control. Genetic engineering may provide solutions for Striga control but will likely require multiple approaches because Striga spp. are not host specific and crops vary in their responses. Genes responsible for the production of root exudates that stimulate seed germination, attachment, and haustorium development are potential targets for GE.
In sorghum, the mutant low-germination stimulant allele (lgs) provides resistance to Striga (111). The mutant allele alters the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway to reduce production of the Striga germination stimulant strigol (50). The mutation does not block the pathway, which would be detrimental to the host, but alters biosynthesis so that a nongermination stimulant strigolactone is exuded by the roots. Editing of the LGS gene in other host crops (e.g., maize) could produce resistant cultivars.
RNAi gene silencing in Cuscuta pentagona and Triphysaria versicolor was successful in preventing haustorial establishment and development on tobacco (2) and lettuce (134), respectively. In maize, de Framond et al. (37) found that RNAi was not sufficient to create Striga resistance, whereas Kirigia et al. (73) succeeded in silencing a gene in Striga hermonthica using viral-induced gene silencing (VIGS).
Advances toward producing reference genomes for parasitic species should enable greater use of GE techniques to alter genes involved with parasitism (144). Comparative transcriptome analy- ses identified many putative parasitism genes that were upregulated during haustoria development of three Orobanchaceae spp., including Striga hermonthica (147). Determining which genes to target to prevent or reduce attachment in Striga is ongoing, but there have been promising outcomes.
Case 4: Genetic Engineering Applications to Control Insect Vectors of Plant Disease Pathogens
Aphids, thrips, whiteflies, leafhoppers, planthoppers, and treehoppers are important vectors of plant-pathogenic bacteria and viruses (41, 45, 107). The damage from the vectored pathogens can be reduced by plant resistance to the pathogen developed through breeding as well as trans- genic approaches (79, 150). Alternatively, suppression of the pathogens can be achieved by plant resistance to the insect vector.
Classical host plant resistance breeding aimed at vectors has had some success. The Mi gene in tomato confers resistance to some strains of aphid and whitefly vectors of plant viruses (98, 118). Although this gene provides significant resistance, the level varies with plant age and environment (117), and only some aphid strains are affected (59). It might be feasible to use genomics and gene editing to improve the expression and performance of the Mi gene. Several breeding programs have selected single and multiple genes for resistance to hemipteran vectors of viral pathogens of rice, but these pests have evolved adaptations to the resistance (40, 61). The problem of insect vectors of plant pathogens evolving resistance to naturally occurring resistance mechanisms is widespread (124, 148); thus, deployments of conventionally bred resistant cultivars should apply strategies that maintain their effectiveness.
The need for appropriate deployment strategies extends to recent GE approaches for resistance toinsectvectors(130).ToxinsfromthebacteriumBacillusthuringiensis(Bt)havebeensuccessfully moved into a variety of crops to suppress damage from major lepidopteran and coleopteran pests (94). Efforts to modify the Bt toxin–coding genes to produce proteins that are toxic to Hemiptera have had limited success. Chougule et al. (30) were the first to develop a modified Bt toxin with

  some action against aphids. Subsequent efforts to modify another toxin-coding gene resulted in some improvements (113), but neither of these efforts resulted in commercial products. The Mon- santo company also worked on developing Hemiptera-active Bt toxins and recently tested a plant- incorporated Bt aimed at control of Lygus plant bugs (8, 53). In addition to impacts on Lygus, these plants had significantly less damage from the Frankliniella species of thrips (53). It is feasible that this toxin could be used to control plant-pathogen vectors in the future.
Beyond the use of Bt toxins, researchers have been considering a number of other effector molecules that include spider-derived toxins expressed in phloem tissues and a lectin that could impact whiteflies and aphids (56). The use of plant-produced RNAi to control insect pests has been considered for a number of years (14), but only recently has strong insect control with this method been accomplished (152). Unfortunately, recent work has also shown that selection for resistance to a specific RNAi transcript can result in broad resistance to RNAi (71). Therefore, as with all forms of plant resistance to insect herbivores, RNAi approaches must follow strategies to maintain their effectiveness.
Gene Drives: Incipient and Future Genetic Engineering Technology
A strikingly different approach for suppressing populations of plant-pathogen vectors, or inter- fering with their transmission of plant pathogens, involves insect transgenesis with selfish genetic elements that cause super-Mendelian inheritance of insect traits that interfere with either insect reproduction or pathogen replication (51, 125). These gene drive approaches have progressed rapidly in the past few years (78). Approaches for engineering insects to suppress pathogen repli- cation have also moved forward (39), but much work remains. It is likely that the first field releases of insects for disease control will focus on insects that transmit human pathogens, but this may open opportunities for using these approaches for suppression of specific insect-vectored plant pathogens. It is important to note that gene drive strategies are not feasible unless there is obligate sexual reproduction. Most aphids are therefore not targets for gene drives, and some pathogen- vectoring thrips can also be parthenogenic (68). Bemisia tabaci whiteflies are haplodiploid (26); thus, they could be targeted through the meiotic stage of females, but the process would not be as effective as it would be in the typically sexual, diploid planthoppers and leafhoppers (69). One cur- rent target of gene drives is the Asian citrus psyllid that transmits the pathogen involved in citrus greening (10). Neve (97) describes possibilities to apply CRISPR-Cas9-based gene drive systems for agricultural weed management, although overcoming the tremendous seed production capac- ity or the self-fertilizing nature of many weed species makes this challenging. The technologies used for gene drives are in their infancy but will likely mature into useful species-specific, geo- graphically confinable, and recallable (89) tools for pest management.
Synthetic Biology: Unfolding and Futuristic Genetic Engineering Technology
Synthetic biology applies GE principles to design and alter natural systems or artificially construct biological devices and systems with predictable behaviors (83, 121). CRISPR-mediated gene editing is a synthetic biology extension of current GE paradigms and is already proving useful for conferring various resistance traits to crops. Looking beyond gene editing, the redesign of simple genetic parts, usually as single components in a construct, such as promoters, has been the most frequent embodiment of synthetic biology. At its core, synthetic biology should be capable of endowing extensive and transformative changes to organisms by leveraging advanced computational design and building synthetic DNA constructs and then large-scale installation of many genetic components into plant genomes at once or in series. Analogous to the DNA

sequencing revolution that has enabled reading genomic DNA, the emerging DNA synthesis revolution allows for unprecedented scales of writing DNA into genomes.
In Sc2.0 (http://syntheticyeast.org), the most ambitious synthetic biology program with a eukaryotic organism to date, each chromosome of baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is being synthesized and inserted into the genome piece by piece (24, 114). The goal is to create the first synthetic genome within a complex organism. This stepwise rebuilding of a complete genome elucidates an unprecedented understanding of the organism and its fundamental biology, raising immense prospects for rewriting genomes. Advances in synthetic biology may enable the design, building, and installation of a synthetic genome into plants (or even a chromosome or subgenome) to confer pest resistance or for other practical uses in agriculture. Indeed, writing large amounts of synthetic DNA into plants has natural precedence in the form of viruses, such as caulimovirus and geminivirus, that exist episomally and add information to plant genomes.
The most amenable subgenome in plants for synthetic engineering is the plastid genome, and the expanding list of crop plants with engineered plastids currently includes soybean, lettuce, and potato. Given that the plant kingdom excels in producing a wide range of biochemicals, it follows that the blueprints for endowing crops with new defense chemicals exist in nature. As one example, the plant kingdom knows how to produce more than 21,000 different alkaloids, including those with pesticidal properties (38, 123). Although technologically challenging at present, it should be feasible to identify the key gene(s) in metabolic pathways by which plants produce fungicidal compounds. In addition, it should also be feasible to transfer these genes into a crop where they would be inducibly expressed upon fungal infection.
A second, even more futuristic and transformative example, is the production and installation of a synthetic chloroplast genome, a synplastome (110), for broad pest resistance. We know that the plastid is the target of multiple viruses that cause disease in plants (153). Of all plant genomes, the plastome would be the most straightforward to design, build, and install, not least because it is minuscule compared with the nuclear genome (e.g., the tobacco plastome is only 156 kb and contains ∼100 genes). Although the first synplastome is nearing completion (110), we still do not know how difficult it will be to install and maintain a synplastome in plants as a replacement for the native plastome. If successful, it could enable large-scale metabolic engineering within the plastid itself.
One particularly intriguing idea is to recode the genome to endow resistance to viruses. Bacterial virus (bacteriophage) infection is a tremendous practical problem when using bacteria as bioreactors and in laboratory cultures. Although various recoding experiments have been performed, Ostrov et al. (100) conducted the most pertinent study to our review when she and colleagues removed seven codons from the Escherichia coli genome. The elimination of seven codons required more than 62,000 mutations, which rendered very few errors in the recoded genome. In addition, the cognate tRNAs for each of the six-amino-acid–deleted codons (there was one recoded stop codon) were deleted. This study is the latest effort to totally recode the E. coli genome for virus resistance. An earlier effort recoded a stop codon and achieved resistance to the T7 bacteriophage (80). Recoded genomes render the codons of invading viruses untranslatable in the host. For example, if a key viral stop codon is deleted in its host genome but recoded in the host to another stop codon, the virus cannot infect the host. Indeed, Ma &amp; Isaacs (86) found that a stop codon–recoded E. coli was resistant to multiple viruses. A completely recoded plastome could, theoretically, result in complete and broad resistance against all plastid-targeted viruses because the viruses would no longer be able to replicate or express genes in the plastid. Scott Lenaghan (personal communication) has calculated that recoding histidine to use a single tRNA would require only 324 mutations in the plastome, which may be achievable through gene editing, although doing so would be an ambitious undertaking. A more radical approach, e.g., the

  reduction of a single codon each for histidine, tyrosine, and valine, would require 1,583 mutations, which may be possible only through a synplastomic approach. Synthetic genome biology could offer an evolutionary revolution by giving crops an advantage in the evolutionary race against much more nimbly evolving pathogens. Indeed, recoding codons may be a new integrative strategy for virus resistance. Doing so would set up viral roadblocks to multiple viruses, instead of the one-by-one resistance strategy that is currently common.
Summary: Genetic Engineering Science and Technology
The GE toolbox has expanded since its earliest days, and plant scientists are using these tools in the discovery, validation, and, increasingly, deployment of improved, including disease-resistant, crops. New and emerging GE tools appear to offer great potential, perhaps exceeding the largely unrealized vision of Barton &amp; Brill (12) 36 years ago. Although conventional as well as twentieth- and twenty-first-century biotechnologies offer a variety of approaches to solve challenges in plant protection, it is critically important to understand and address prospective applications in rele- vant socioeconomic contexts, globally and locally, given that these affect the implementations, including by whom, for whom, and what, when, and where.
SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXT INFLUENCING THE FUTURE OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS
Many published analyses conclude that genetically engineered crops outyield and economically outperform their non–genetically engineered counterparts (see the sidebar titled Realized and Op- portunity Benefits and Costs of Genetically Engineered Crops). Furthermore, as shown above, it is unlikely that there will be a shortage of GE innovations in the agricultural and life sciences. However, social–institutional contexts have shaped and will continue to shape the capacity of researchers to develop their ideas and the capacity of farmers to gain access to and realize the
REALIZED AND OPPORTUNITY BENEFITS AND COSTS OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS
A report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) (94) and several recent meta- analyses conclude that genetically engineered maize, cotton, and soybean varieties often outyield and economically outperform their conventional counterparts (21, 42, 74, 106, 112). The yield advantage is greater for insect-resistant crops under conditions of substantial pest pressure than for herbicide-resistant crops. The advantages have been estimated as 14–40% greater in developing than in developed countries (6, 27, 42, 74). Economic benefits have generally accrued to farmers adopting transgenic crops (6, 22, 63, 74, 94, 106, 108). It is important to note that some of the studies cited here do not differentiate between yield increases caused by the transgene, differential farmer practices, and seed quality or differences between breeding efforts associated with genetically engineered and non–genetically engineered varieties (94).
Adoption or nonadoption of genetically engineered crop technologies has also resulted in opportunity benefits (63) and costs (20, 143) that are often overlooked. The wide use of genetically engineered insect-resistant crops can suppress a targeted insect(s) across broad regions and increase yield and economic benefits for adopters and nonadopters of the genetically engineered varieties (63). Unintended costs of adopting genetically engineered crops may also accrue, e.g., those caused by glyphosate-resistant weeds for US farmers (84, 90). However, this should be considered alongside the economic (94) and ecological benefits accrued from genetically engineered crops enabling the use of glyphosate instead of more toxic herbicides (75).

potential benefits from new technologies. Although we highlight the roles of social and insti- tutional contexts, this does not deny the role of individuals’ beliefs and values on the types of genetically engineered crops that are developed and deployed (94). Rather, it recognizes that un- derstanding the institutional contexts helps to explain why stakeholders engage in one activity or adopt one position as opposed to another (58).
Beyond conferring disease resistance, enhanced yield, or improved agronomic performance, genetically engineered crops can contribute to societal ambitions to reduce pesticide use and chemical applications in general and agriculture’s negative impacts on nontarget organisms and biodiversity. Genetically engineered crops, deployed within integrated systems, can contribute to disease and pest management within agroecologically sustainable boundaries (81, 94).
Institutional Factors Affecting the Realization of the Potential Benefits of Genetically Engineered Crops
Multiple institutional factors affect which traits and crops benefit from research investments that include the use of GE technologies. We review four factors that are relevant in both low- and high- income countries and discuss how they converge to determine who might benefit from genetically engineered crops.
Public-sector investments play a crucial role in genetic engineering and research and de- velopment outcomes. Various authors have documented large investments by the private sector in the United States on genetically engineered crops and other high-technology agricultural re- search. Concomitantly, however, public expenditures on agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) in many high-income countries have stagnated and even begun to decline (60). Public- sector investments in R&amp;D and in science and technology vary in low- and middle-income coun- tries. Whereas China, India, and Brazil have greatly increased their public agricultural research capacity and agricultural output (60), public investments in R&amp;D and science have generally plateaued or declined in sub-Saharan Africa (16, 146). Weak R&amp;D capacity in many low-income nations, exacerbated by declining public-sector funding by high-income nations, raises concerns about many countries’ abilities to develop and deliver high-quality innovations using GE and other complex technologies.
Most of the genetically engineered crops deregulated and approved for field release in the United States relate to herbicide and insect resistance in crops that are produced on large areas and offer good returns on investment in R&amp;D (94). Apart from some traits that address pathogens in minor crops, including papaya, potato, plums, and squash, there are few GE applications related to plant diseases. In contrast to minor crops, which are produced in smaller areas, orphan crops, such as yam, are important staples and widely grown in many lower-income nations. Orphan crops may attract little private-sector investment because they are grown primarily by resource-poor households with little capacity to purchase inputs such as genetically engineered seeds or vegeta- tive material. As a result, most research on minor and orphan crops has been funded through the public purse and conducted by universities and international research centers.
During the first decade of genetically engineered crop research at universities in the United States, research agendas increasingly shifted toward major crops and away from minor crops, thus lookingmorelikeprivate-firmresearchagendas(142).Twointerconnectedsocioeconomictrends help to explain this shift. The first is that public funding for agricultural R&amp;D in the United States remained flat from the 1980s to the early 2000s and declined in subsequent decades. Sec- ond, investments by the private sector increased significantly, especially in biological sciences. These trends resulted in a dramatic increase in the private share of agricultural and food R&amp;D

  investments while driving the public sector to increase its focus on major crops and pursue income- generating opportunities (see below) to close the funding gap (48). Pressures to increase private returns from university R&amp;D cut across all agricultural research efforts in US universities. Inci- dentally, Barton &amp; Brill (12) repeatedly emphasized the need for more basic research on plant bio- chemistry as a prerequisite for achieving the potential benefits from genetically engineered crops that they envisioned 36 years ago. Perhaps the excitement of success with simple engineered traits has contributed to insufficient funding for this basic research.
High benefit-to-cost ratios for US federal and state investments, estimated at 10:1 to 30:1, sig- nal underinvestment in agricultural R&amp;D, which even at 10:1 imposes a net social cost of at least US$36 billion per year (4, 5). To help resolve such drastic underinvestment, Pardey &amp; Beddow (102) proposed doubling US public investment in agricultural R&amp;D as a first step, followed by regular and sustained increases in the long run. Development and delivery of the potential bene- fits of genetically engineered crops to smallholder farmers in lower-income countries require the extension of the recommendation to the public international research system conducting R&amp;D in and for lower-income countries.
Intellectual property regimes influence genetic engineering and research and develop- ment outcomes. Another important trend in the United States and elsewhere is that crops are increasingly protected by intellectual property (IP) rights, including utility patents (146). The 1930 Plant Patent Act and the 1970 Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) in the United States and the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV), allowed for the protection of plants that are deemed “distinct, uniform, and stable” (19). Although the PVPA and UPOV protected new varieties, they allowed scientists to conduct research and de- velop innovations on those protected varieties, and farmers could save seed for replanting but not sale.
By contrast, utility patents prevent farmers from saving seed for replanting and scientists from conducting research or developing innovations on patented crops without the approval of the patent holder (94). The United States began allowing the application of utility patents to crops generated through biotechnology in the 1980s and extended this to include conventionally bred crops in 2001. In contrast, the European Union prohibits patents on biological processes, which include crossing and selection by breeders.
There are two competing narratives regarding IP. A more pessimistic narrative describes IP regimes as detrimental to innovation, especially to the development of public goods, and pro- poses that IP instruments be limited in, if not withdrawn from, public policy. In the more positive narrative, IP regimes, despite providing time-limited market power to the grantee, promote in- novation by protecting the IP of firms and individuals, helping them to secure returns on R&amp;D investments. Resolving the detrimental versus incentive nature of IP regimes is directly related to whether private-sector R&amp;D is a complement to or a substitute for public-sector R&amp;D. Public policy introducing stronger IP regimes is viewed as an option to promote private investments in R&amp;D and therefore can strongly influence the scope and beneficiaries of GE and overall agricul- tural R&amp;D, especially in low-income countries (93).
The converging trends of a rising share of private R&amp;D funding and the emergence of stricter IP protections are important because they indicate a shift in public policy toward the private sector in resolving agricultural problems. An area of concern is that the private sector is likely to invest mainly in major crops and major traits, so work on minor, perennial, clonal, or staple food crops of lower-income nations is likely to suffer. If not addressed, this will be a critical constraint on emerging technologies, including those addressing diseases, and especially in, but not limited to, low-income countries.

Pixley et al.
Biosafety regulatory issues influence genetic engineering and research and development outcomes. The costs and complexity of compliance with biosafety regulatory requirements can constrain genetically engineered crop R&amp;D and deployment (94). The cost of regulatory compli- ance for transgenic crop varieties varies and may be as low as US$1.5–5 million for a small private firm in the United States or international research center in eastern Africa submitting a regulatory dossier for commercial release in just one country (94, 120). This contrasts with an estimate of US$35 million for regulatory approval of a transgenic crop variety following the industry standard for commercial crops requiring commercial release in at least two countries plus import approval of that crop for food and feed purposes in at least five countries (109).
The complex and potentially costly nature of complying with biosafety regulations may strongly influence which institutions undertake GE R&amp;D and therefore which traits and crops are studied. As discussed above, many countries are still deciding whether and how they will reg- ulate products of novel breeding technologies, with obvious consequences for the availability of potential benefits of these genetically engineered crops for their farmers and consumers (151).
Civil society institutions influence genetic engineering and research and development out- comes. Genetically engineered crops have been in commercial use in the United States since 1995, but their deployment and use in Europe remains limited. This difference is at least partially due to deep divisions in societal opinion concerning the risks and benefits of GE and to very vocal lobby- ing by environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and political parties. The risks of GE technologies include unintended effects, e.g., off-target editing, and unanticipated costs, such as herbicide-resistant weeds (the sidebar titled Realized and Opportunity Benefits and Costs of Genetically Engineered Crops describes examples of beneficial and negative unintended effects of genetically engineered crops). Potential risks from careless stewardship or misuse of some GE technologies require appropriate regulations and expert oversight (101). None of these risks is unique to GE technologies.
Graff et al. (54) argue that resistance from diverse stakeholders should be viewed within a political–economic context. They suggest that because US biotechnology firms were far ahead of firms in other countries in researching and commercializing genetically engineered crops, large agricultural chemical firms in Europe perceived a threat to their business model. There- fore, whereas large firms in the United States were commercializing and promoting genetically engineered crops, large European agricultural firms were not as advanced as the US firms and saw potential business risks to opening the European markets to the new technology. This created the political–economic space in Europe for consumer and small farmer advocacy groups to have greater influence on policy makers.
The influence of various concerned groups is perhaps exemplified by international protests such as the “March Against Monsanto,” which has been an annual event across many countries since 2013 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_Against_Monsanto). Essentially, the argu- ments against GE technologies have become conflated with arguments against the monopolies and oligopolies of the seed industry. Currently, five companies dominate more than 75% of global seed sales and all have major stakes in sales of agrochemicals, some of which are connected to genetically engineered crops.
Some objectors perceive that these firms are privatizing public goods such as genetic resources while increasing dependence on agrochemicals. The use of genetically engineered crops is pro- hibited in organic agriculture and strongly resisted by many promoting agroecology as a social movement. Thus, discussions about the use of GE technologies have become inextricably con- nected to debates about public–private ownership and access to genetic resources, the right of farmers to retain seed, food sovereignty, and the agroecological sustainability of food systems.

     POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED LATE BLIGHT–RESISTANT POTATO
Giller et al. (46) discuss the role of GE in pest and disease management in relation to agroecology using the example of cis-gene engineered resistance to Phytophthora infestans (late blight) in potato. This GE technology was developed using public funds, with open public consultation throughout the process and patents taken out to prevent private monopoly of the resistance methods. The stacking of three sources of disease resistance within the same variety cut the required spraying of fungicides to a single spray, reducing costs and pressure on the pathogen to evolve fungicide resistance compared to the current practice of spraying 15–20 times per season.
This is a clear example of the tools of nature being harnessed to overcome an economically devastating disease with massive environmental benefits in terms of reduced fungicide use. Thus, GE is potentially one of the strongest tools for reducing dependence on agrochemicals and as such could be considered a fundamental agroecological approach (46). Genetically engineered crop technologies need to be evaluated on an individual trait basis, and their likely benefits or costs considered, free from dogmatic or ideological stances.
Convergence of institutional forces affects the realization of benefits from genetically engineered crop technologies. The research, development, and introduction of genetically en- gineered crops in the United States roughly coincided with the rise of a policy agenda directed at reducing public expenditures on agricultural R&amp;D (49). Decreases in public investments on agri- cultural R&amp;D cannot be blamed exclusively on genetically engineered crops because the United Kingdom and other countries in the EU have also cut public expenditures and sought to privatize R&amp;D (44). However, Busch (25) suggests that policy makers may view innovations such as geneti- cally engineered crops, which can be privatized more easily than previous products of agricultural crops, as a mechanism for reducing the role of government in agriculture.
The convergence of the reduction of public expenditures with a greater reliance on the pri- vate sector in the United States to conduct research and deliver outputs has been associated with a decline in agricultural research innovations (49) and university research on minor crops and minor traits (142) and consolidation of the seed industry (47). Concerns over real and perceived consequences of these trends have fueled social reactions, including some that focus on the role of GE technologies while ignoring or negating their potential benefits. For example, late blight– resistant genetically engineered potato, which would greatly reduce fungicide use (see the sidebar titled Potential Benefits of Genetically Engineered Late Blight–Resistant Potato), offers ecologi- cal benefits.
Realizing broad social and ecological benefits from GE technologies requires new approaches that counter current institutional convergence trends (Figure 1). New approaches require greater integration with agroecological perspectives and far more consideration of the social and institu- tional contexts within which GE research is conducted and its outputs are diffused. Substantial public-sector investments are necessary to deliver effective and trustworthy public-interest GE re- search and regulations. New plant breeding technologies, e.g., genome editing, can also help bal- ance agricultural R&amp;D efforts between large commercial crops and smaller or orphan crops and counter current trends toward concentration of the seed market into a few, large companies (151).

Institutional forces (arrows) alter the balance of (a) research and development (R&amp;D) investments by the public relative to the private sector, (b) R&amp;D emphasis on crops with low-value relative to high-value seed markets, which are often the crops of resource-poor versus resource-wealthy farmers, and therefore (c) who will benefit from the technologies as consumers of the improved crops. Achieving equity in access to the potential benefits of genetically engineered crops (or any technology, e.g., internet, cell phones, or radio) may require policy changes and actions (forces) to counterbalance prevailing trends.

international research centers have been at the forefront of generating public goods in agriculture and technologies for low-income countries. Although they do conduct R&amp;D in genetically engineered crops, CGIAR centers have not taken a leadership position on them. GE research at nine CGIAR centers addresses tolerance to disease pathogens, insects, nematodes, drought, heat, flooding, salinity, and low soil nitrogen, as well as several nutritional and agronomic properties (Supplemental Table 1). This research involves banana, barley, bean, cassava, chickpea, cowpea, enset, groundnut, lentil, maize, pigeon pea, plantain, potato, rice, sorghum, sweet potato, and wheat (67, 99). The crops and traits are of interest to producers in low-income countries. Although several CGIAR genetically engineered crop projects are in the R&amp;D pipeline, none have yet resulted in releases to farmers.
The relatively minor investment of CGIAR in GE research may be a consequence of institu- tional convergence forces described above. The complex IP environment surrounding GE tech- nologies presents challenges to all small and medium-sized institutions (67), including the need to invest in regulatory capacity and expertise to research, develop, and deploy genetically engi- neered crops. Moreover, many CGIAR institutes work within the centers of diversity of the crops, which often implies that there are restrictions in terms of biosafety, germplasm use, and biodiver- sity, which may constrain GE R&amp;D and innovation (67). Their funders, some of which are based in countries with a historical precautionary approach to genetically engineered crops and other

  advanced biotechnology techniques, also influence the CGIAR research agenda (72). Many of these challenges open reputational, financial, and liability concerns, even when following globally accepted standards.
Considering the critical role of CGIAR and other international and national agricultural research organizations in ensuring equitable access to technology, and that technology itself contributes to equitable impacts on society through productivity improvements, these public institutions are ethically compelled to assume a role in GE research. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) has issued public position statements explaining its rationale and guiding principles for conducting GE research (31, 32). Although the private sector does not share this specific mandate with the public sector, it can contribute to the public good through private–public collaborations.
The Bottom Line: Genetically Engineered Crops Reaching Farmers
Perhaps the best summary indicator of the opportunities and challenges presented by genetically engineered crops is the number and range of crops reaching farmers. The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotechnology Applications (ISAAA) (65) and Center for Environmental Risk Assessment (CERA) (28) databases list 497 crop varieties with genetically engineered traits that have been approved for commercial cultivation or importation as food or feed commodities, 22 of which pertain to disease resistance (Table 1). Crops in which disease resistance has been introduced using GE techniques include bean, papaya, plum, potato, squash, sweet pepper, and

tomato. Approvals for commercialization have been granted in Brazil, Canada, China, and the United States, and approvals for importation as food or feed (not listed in Table 1) have been made in a significantly larger number of countries.
Table 2 lists 35 genetically engineered crop products under consideration in seven African countries (see Supplemental Table 2 for further details). These products are in crops of interest to smallholder farmers, including cassava, cowpea, sorghum, bananas, and maize. In this list, 11 of the 35 products are for disease resistance, outnumbering insect resistance and herbicide resistance, which have been the two traits with the largest share of releases globally. Furthermore, 23 are in the confined field trial stage, whereas 10 of the 35 are at the multilocational or general release (national performance) trial stage, indicating they could soon be available to farmers. The country with the most regulatory experience in Africa is the Republic of South Africa, with 21 commercially released genetically engineered cultivars of cotton, maize, and soybean (57) (Supplemental Table 3).
It is important not to assume that new crop technologies will inexorably become available to farmers as soon as the regulatory requirements are met or removed. Substantial investments are needed to use the new technologies to develop local varieties, generate necessary information and educational materials, explain the potential benefits and proper handling to farmers, produce enough seeds to meet farmer demands, and distribute the seeds to the farmers who want them. Furthermore, many smallholder farmers face social, economic, and gender barriers in getting ac- cess to the inputs, land, and labor needed to grow crops.
To realize the potential benefits of GE or other technologies requires defining and addressing the most important institutional constraints (136). For example, Traore (135) found that Guinean farmers in 2017 lacked access to improved conventional rice varieties since 2008 because of cut- backs in seed production and distribution infrastructure. Where important constraints already exist to spreading conventionally improved crop seeds, it is unlikely that genetically engineered crop seeds will be distributed more effectively unless appropriate resources and approaches are applied to address both existing and additional institutional constraints that apply to genetically engineered crops.
CONCLUSION
Disease control in agricultural crops will continue to have a significant role in addressing issues of food security and sustainability globally (119, 128), perhaps increasingly so with pending climate

  change (85). The already realized positive impacts on farm productivity and profitability, and the potential benefits from current, emerging, and future GE technologies are exciting, although nobody would propose that they are sufficient to ensure food security. We have described some notable examples of promising GE approaches to manage cassava viruses and bacterial blight, mycotoxin-producing fungi in groundnut, parasitic weeds in cereals, and insect vectors of plant-pathogenic bacteria and viruses, and we listed numerous emerging and potential other examples. To date, however, few genetically engineered crops addressing plant diseases have been released to farmers.
There are legitimate reasons why so few pathogen-resistant genetically engineered crops ex- ist. Regulatory hurdles favor single-gene answers to pathogen resistance, but other than virus resistance, it is hard to find monogenic resistance. Nonetheless, the growing list of regulatory ap- provals of pathogen-resistant crops and the robust pipeline of emerging and future possibilities suggest that the greatest challenges will be nonscientific. Potent institutional forces will markedly influence whether and which benefits of genetically engineered crops are realized and by whom. Realizing the potential contributions of genetically engineered crops will require investments and policies in research, IP regimes, and regulatory frameworks while also addressing legitimate so- cietal concerns about their responsible stewardship, agroecological sustainability, and equitable access to their benefits.

Feeding the famine? American food aid and the
Abstract
GMO debate in Southern Africaq Noah Zerbe
Department of Government and Politics, Humboldt State University, USA Center for Philosophy of Law, Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium
The inclusion of genetically modified maize in food aid shipments to Southern Africa dur- ing the 2002 food crisis rekindled debates over agricultural biotechnology. As the region edged ever closer to famine – putting the lives to some 14 million Africans at risk – corporate pun- dits, government officials and biotechÕs critics debated the health and environmental dangers posed by the new technology.
By situating the decision to send genetically modified maize to Southern Africa in the con- text of US–European debates over agricultural biotechnology, it becomes clear that the pro- motion of biotechnology has nothing to do with ending hunger in the region. Indeed, American food aid shipments to Southern Africa have little to do with the famine at all. Instead, I argue that US food aid policy following the 2002 crisis was intended to promote the adoption of biotech crops in Southern Africa, expanding the market access and control of transnational corporations and undermining local smallholder production thereby fostering greater food insecurity on the Continent.

594 N. Zerbe / Food Policy 29 (2004) 593–608 Introduction
In the spring of 2002, Southern Africa stood on the brink of the worst food crisis since the 1992 drought, as some 15 million people across the region – comprising approximately 26% of the regionÕs population – faced critical food shortages caused by a complex combination of factors, including climatic shocks, HIV/AIDS, struc- tural adjustment, debt, collapsing public services, and poor governance. Across the region, non-governmental organizations and international relief bodies mobi- lized to prevent famine. The World Food Program (WFP) appealed to the developed world for financial resources to feed hungry populations in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and Western governments re- sponded with the usual package of relief, providing various mixtures of cash and in-kind assistance.
However, in October 2002 the relief effort took an unexpected twist, as the governments of Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe rejected US food aid because of concerns over the inclusion of genetically modified maize. What had until that point been a routine food aid operation quickly took on added significance, as European and American debates over trade in genetically modi- fied organisms (GMOs) expanded to encompass Southern Africa. The relief effort became enmeshed in the quagmire surrounding agricultural biotechnology and genetically modified food, as the pro- and anti-GM lobbies each moved to out- flank the other to capture the moral high ground. BiotechnologyÕs advocates, pri- marily based in the United States but also including major GM exporters like Canada, Australia and Argentina, accused their opponents of allowing millions of Africans to starve because of irrational fears over hypothetical and unproven risks. The point was most clearly articulated by Andrew Natsios, head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), who contended that anti-GM ‘‘groups are putting millions of lives at risk in a despicable way’’ (cited in Vidal, 2002). Those opposed to GMOs countered that the United States was exploiting the Southern African famine as a public relations tool to improve the belea- guered image of agricultural biotechnology. Having been unable to capture pop- ular support for their products, particularly in Europe, the biotechnology industry was now using the Southern African crisis to garner sympathy for genetically modified organisms. Southern Africa had become embroiled in de- bates that extended far beyond the simple and immediate question of famine prevention.
In this paper, I examine the debates over genetically modified food aid in Southern Africa. I argue that, despite American claims to the contrary, US food aid to Southern Africa had little to do with the impending famine. In- stead, the provision of assistance to Southern Africa was primarily intended to secure particular foreign policy objectives of the US government – in this case, promoting the cultivation of biotech crops, expanding market access and control of transnational agricultural corporations, and isolating Europe in the GMO debate. I begin by briefly outlining the scope and causes of the 2002 food crisis in Southern Africa. I challenge the assertion that the crisis

was solely the result of poor governance, arguing instead that the regional food shortage emerged through a combination of factors including climactic varia- bles, international and domestic governance problems, and HIV/AIDS. I then consider the decision of the governments of Southern Africa to reject American food aid despite the looming famine. I argue that the decision to reject US food aid was based not merely on the environmental and health considerations typically raised by biotechÕs critics, but focused more directly on questions of domestic and international political economy, and on market access to the European Union and the potential premium paid for certified non-GM agricul- ture in particular. The failure of American policy makers and the biotech lobby to understand the contextual rationality of the decision-making process in Southern Africa exacerbated the crisis while simultaneously undermining the capacity of governments and relief agencies to arrive at direct solutions to the Southern African food crisis.
The Southern African food emergency
Early in the spring of 2002, it became clear that Southern Africa was rapidly slip- ping into a food crisis. Across the region, over 14 million people were threatened by famine, and an estimated one million metric tons of food was required to meet emer- gency demand (see Table 1 below).
The trigger for the food crisis was the disruption of normal patterns of cul- tivation by erratic weather, as heavy rains early in the growing season led to floods, which were followed by long periods of drought. The underlying causes, however, remain disputed. The US State Department was quick to promote its governance agenda. It vilified Zimbabwe and the Mugabe regime, arguing that the current land crisis had disrupted commercial cultivation in the breadbasket of the region. From their perspective, the politicization of the land question in Zimbabwe had undermined production across Southern Africa, turning what

might normally have been a minor weather problem into a regional crisis. The sentiment was articulated by Representative Henry Hyde, who argued before the US House that,
[T]oday, a self-inflicted food crisis grips [Zimbabwe]. The illegitimate Mug- abe regime is squarely to blame. Rarely has promise and production so quickly turned to stagnation and uncertainty. Government-sponsored insta- bility, self-destructive economic policies, and the land invasion and confisca- tion campaign of the Mugabe regime are the chief causes of food shortages, not only for Zimbabwe, but for the region as well. ZimbabweÕs declining economy and continued political uncertainty have led to inflation, higher unemployment, and a rise in prices of staple foods (US House of Represent- atives, 2002, p. 7).
Elsewhere in the region, other African governments received a smaller (but not insignificant) share of the blame. While the food crisis in Zimbabwe was attributed primarily (if not exclusively) to the policies of the Mugabe govern- ment, poor governance in other countries in the region also contributed to the food crisis. Weather remained the proximate cause of the food shortages, but poor governance by African states also received a portion of the blame. The government of Malawi, for example, was criticized for its decision to sell its maize reserve just months before the onset of the crisis. Representa- tive Benjamin Gilman, for example, argued in the same US House hearings that,
Although the flooding that destroyed much of last yearÕs harvest and the dry weather are the primary causes of the food crisis, politics has also played an important role. The fact that MalawiÕs grain reserve was recently sold off with- out any clear explanation raises some very serious questions as to the ability and the willingness of the regional governments to act decisively on this issue and to come to the aid of their own people (US House of Representatives, 2002, p. 17).
Indeed, the decision of the Malawi government to sell its grain reserves just three months before the food crisis appears to represent a particularly telling example of the poor governance decried by US aid agencies and international financial institutions. The warning signs of famine were already emerging at that time, and regional governments and non-governmental organizations should have been preparing to address the upcoming crisis. But the decision by the govern- ment of Malawi to divest its national maize reserve was not solely its own. In- deed, according to MalawiÕs President Muluzi, the government was ‘‘forced [to sell the maize] in order to repay commercial loans taken out to buy surplus maize in previous years.’’ He said that the IMF and World Bank ‘‘insisted that, since Malawi had a surplus and the [governmentÕs] National Food Reserve Agency had this huge loan, they had to sell the maize to repay the commercial banks’’ (cited in Pettifor, 2003, p. 1). The World Bank and IMF demanded that Malawi reduce its grain reserves from 165,000 metric tons to 60,000 metric tons to raise

N. Zerbe / Food Policy 29 (2004) 593–608 597
revenue for debt servicing. 1 However, Malawi went further, selling not just the 28,000 metric tons requested by the World Bank or the more stringent demands of the IMF to sell over 100,000 metric tons but the entire reserve, on the advice of a European Union consultant (IRIN, 2002). According to an ActionAid re- port, much of the maize reserve was purchased by commercial traders, who pur- chased the grain and hoarded it until prices rose during the food crisis (Devereux, 2002).
As the crisis unfolded, MalawiÕs international creditors further undermined the capacity of the state to respond to the emerging food shortages. Accusations of mis- management and corruption, particularly in the events surrounding the Strategic Grain Reserves sale, led the IMF to suspend debt service relief and other interna- tional donors, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, to suspend aid. As a precondition for the resumption of development and assistance programs, MalawiÕs creditors demanded the state immediately remove all farming and food subsidies to allow the market mechanism to determine food prices (Pettifor, 2003). In the context of the food crisis and associated maize shortages, the market price for basic foodstuffs in Malawi spiraled. Ultimately, the government of Malawi was forced to take out new loans from international creditors to purchase grain on international markets at prices much higher than it received when it was forced to sell its maize reserve just a few months earlier. The decision to sell MalawiÕs stra- tegic maize reserve in the face of an impending food crisis highlights the problem of poor governance – not in African governments – but in international financial insti- tutions and donor governments and their misguided policy prescriptions for the region.
In many ways, the shortcomings of regional governments have become an easy scapegoat for explaining not just the 2002 food emergency in Southern Africa, but the failure of development in the region more generally. Corruption and financial mismanagement may indeed be a problem, and the Mugabe regime is a particularly easy target. In Malawi, the decision of the government to exceed the recommenda- tions of its international creditors, and more generally the process by which the grain reserve was sold, may indeed have contributed to the food crisis that affected the country in 2002. But were such governance failures solely or even primarily respon- sible for the food crisis?
1 In testimony before the British Parliament in July 2002, the IMFÕs Managing Director, Horst Koehler, placed the blame for the pressure on the Malawi government to sell its maize reserve squarely on the shoulders on the World Bank and the European Union, arguing that, ‘‘The IMF is not the scapegoat for everything. The advice (to sell the maize) was given by the World Bank and the European Union itÕs plain wrong to blame the IMF. Ask the World Bank and the EU what they did. The IMF was part of this process, the IMF may not have been attentive enough; but the decision was with the World Bank and EU.’’ Koehler nevertheless concedes that ‘‘there have been mistakes made’’ in Malawi (Jubilee 2000 UK, 2002, np). This testimony appears to contradict an IMF statement that it ‘‘strongly advised the government to reduce the level of the grain reserve to between 30,000 and 60,000 tons, on cost-effective grounds, but not to sell it all off.’’ Based on what were, in hindsight, dramatically inaccurate crop forecasts, the IMF said that the stock would have been replentished through local purchases after the 2001 harvest. According to the IMF, ‘‘The advice would have been correct if the information was correct’’ (cited in Devereaux, 200s: 10).

Southern Africa has a long history of endemic droughts. As a region, it regu- larly experiences highly variable rainfall patterns, with periods of excessive rainfall frequently followed by long periods of drought. Since the end of World War II, Southern Africa has experienced eight major drought periods: 1946–1947, 1965– 1966, 1972–1973, 1982–1983, 1986–1988, 1991–1992, 1994–1995, and 2002–2003 (WMO, 1995). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global warming phenomenon is likely to exacerbate rainfall pattern variability in Southern Africa in the future, triggering more frequent food crises (IPCC, 1997; Hulme, 1996). Periods of heavy rainfall followed by periods of long drought–like the period which preceded the 2002 food crisis—will become more common. 2
Amartya SenÕs (1980, 1981) work on famines demonstrates, however, that famines are not caused by changes in rainfall patterns, though such changes may certainly act as a trigger. Famines result from the inability of people to secure access to food—an ‘‘entitlement failure,’’ to use SenÕs terminology. Thus, while regions of the United States may experience drought over an extended period of time, famine does not re- sult because individuals have the capacity to secure food from other sources (e.g. to purchase food produced elsewhere). In Southern Africa, the capacity of individuals to turn to alternative sources of food during times of drought is severely limited by a number of factors: the low level of overall development, the imposition of neoliberal structural adjustment programs, the land question, and the HIV/AIDS crisis, to name but a few. A report by the General Accounting Office attributed the food crisis to a number of factors, including erratic weather, a poorly functioning agricultural sector, poor governance, widespread poverty, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, none of which would have individually led to famine in the absence of the others (GAO, 2003). Although not articulated by the GAO, the report leads to two conclusions in particular. First, neither poor weather nor poor governance was alone responsible for the crisis. Rather, the crisis was the result of a combination of factors, none of which were entirely under the control of governments in the region. The traditional scapegoat for problems in the region (poor governance), as well as the usual expla- nation for failures in crop production (weather), are incapable of adequately accounting for the 2002 crisis in the absence of other contributing factors. Second, none of the problems noted by the GAO are simple questions which can be easily resolved through the application of new technologies. Agricultural technologies, however productive, cannot resolve what are by definition social, political and eco- nomic questions. This important fact is often overlooked by advocates of biotechnol- ogy, who assume that higher yields available through new technologies will resolve
2 Southern Africa, including South Africa, is responsible for an estimated 1–2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the region experiences significant costs associated with changes in the global climate resulting from greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study by the UN Economic Commission for Africa, Southern Africa can expect an increase in climate-related disasters, as droughts, floods and bushfires ravage the region. Crop yields will decline, water will be less available, and diseases like malaria and cholera will increase (UNECA, 2002).

Fighting famine in Southern Africa
Hints of the emerging food crisis emerged as early as March 2001, when the Food and Agricultural Organization reported that flooding and usual dry spells across the region would have a negative impact on productivity in the region. The World Food Program and a number of NGOs, including the Red Cross and Save the Children, launched appeals for emergency relief. But the initial appeals were ignored and do- nor response was slow. It was not until July 2002 that donations started to flow through the World Food Program. The United States took the lead, providing half of the total food aid requirements of the region.
Shortly after the announcement of US donations, concerns over the inclusion of genetically modified (GM) food in aid shipments were raised in the region. Heavily dependent on trade with the United States under the African Growth and Opportu- nities Act (AGOA), Swaziland raised no objections to the GM aid. Lesotho, also dependant on AGOA, requested that food aid be milled before distribution but quickly backed down on its request and accepted unmilled food aid. 4
Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, however, were far more cautious. All four challenged the inclusion of genetically modified maize which had not re- ceived regulatory approval in the region in US food aid shipments. The concerns articulated by recipients of GM food aid in Southern Africa centered on three key areas: (1) the potential health impact of GM food on recipients; (2) the impact of GM food on domestic agricultural biodiversity; and (3) the impact of GM food on their ability to export agricultural commodities in the future. The governments of Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe all requested that GM maize be milled be- fore distribution as food aid to prevent farmers from replanting the seed in future years. Zambia, however, refused to accept any GM food aid until a team of Zambian scientists could study the potential health impacts of the maize. After visits to the United States, South Africa and consultations with several European countries, the Zambian panel concluded that the distribution of biotech maize carried a high risk of eroding the genetic diversity of local maize varieties, the safety aspects of bio- tech foods, including toxicity, allergenicity and antibiotic resistance, were not con- clusively resolved, and that there is a potential risk that the cultivation of biotech
3 A full consideration of each of these variables lies outside the scope of this paper. For a more detailed consideration, see Zerbe (2003).
4 The African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) applied to 39 African countries in mid-2003 and allows for exports of selected commodities to the United States without the usual duties or customs. The official AGOA homepage is located at www.agoa.gov. AGOA has been widely criticized for imposing numerous restrictions on recipients, including the adoption of neoliberal policies, the privatization of state assets, removal of subsidies and price controls, adopting stronger intellectual property protections, and endorsing US foreign policy. For a more detailed discussion, see Bond (2003).

maize in Zambia could endanger future agricultural exports, especially of baby corn and honey but also of organic foods more generally, to the European Union. Based on the report, the Zambian government rejected the inclusion of genetically modified maize in food aid shipments, even if milled. 5
Rather than address the challenges raised regarding genetically modified food in the region, the initial response of the US aid agencies was to dismiss critics of bio- technology and genetically modified food as ignorant and uninformed. Following ZambiaÕs decision to reject GM food aid, an anonymous official at the US State Department lashed out, arguing ‘‘Beggars canÕt be choosers’’ (Weiss, 2002, A12). The US Ambassador to the World Food Program, Tony Hall, argued that ZambiaÕs decision to reject US food aid was a crime against humanity. He accused ‘‘well fed’’ European experts of being selfish, arrogant luddites who were endangering the lives of millions of Africans out of sheer ignorance (Hall, 2002). The discourse emerging in Washington and echoed across a number of UN agencies created the impression that choice facing African governments was either to accept GM food aid or let their populations starve. 6
As opposition to GM food aid increased, however, the US State Department at- tempted to instill a more conciliatory tone in the discussion. It sought to ‘‘educate’’ food aid recipients on the safety of GMOs, producing fact-sheets which argued that GM food meets rigorous food safety standards and had been consumed by Ameri- cans since 1996 without incident. But the State Department continued to refuse to provide cash rather than in-kind aid or to mill food aid before distribution (US Department of State, 2002). It argued that sufficient supplies on non-GM food aid were not available: the United States does not segregate GM and non-GM grains, and sufficient stockpiles were not available outside of the United States. It also re- jected the idea of milling grain before distribution, arguing that the costs associated with milling maize were too high.
5 ZambiaÕs steadfast refusal to accept even milled food aid containing genetically modified maize was justified in public discourse in terms of the potential health risks associated with the consumption of GM maize. In reality, however, the decision was likely based not only on this uncertainty, but equally (or perhaps mostly) on the timing of the decision and the influence of domestic maize producers on the policy process. By the time consensus was reached on the decision to mill GM maize before distribution, crop forecasts for the following season were pointing to a maize surplus in the country. Forecasts that Zambia would produce significantly more maize led to concerns among farmer groups over depressed prices, particularly if US food aid would not arrive until harvest time. The need for American food aid was also reduced in Zambia due to the symbolic importance of the country in larger debates between the US and the European Union over agricultural biotechnology. ZambiaÕs refusal to accept GM food aid mobilized greater aid inflows from Europe, thereby reducing the need for American food aid and making ZambiaÕs anti-GM stance more sustainable.
6 During the course of the debates over GM food aid in Southern Africa, it emerged that the World Food Program had distributed GM food aid in Latin America, South Asia, Eastern and Southern Africa in recent years without the approval of recipient states. A statement by the head of the World Food Program, James Morris, conceded that ‘‘there is no way that the WFP can provide the resources to feed these starving people without using food that has some biotech content’’ (Mail and Guardian, 1 January 2002). Critics of the policy quickly accused the World Food Program of being a mere pawn of USAID (Sharma, 2002).
 
N. Zerbe / Food Policy 29 (2004) 593–608 601
But US policy on genetically modified food aid in Southern Africa was faulty in several respects. First, significant stockpiles of non-GM food aid were available, de- spite assertions by the United States government to the contrary. Inside the region, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and Uganda collectively held more than 1.6 million metric tons of maize, more than enough to satisfy production shortfalls in drought- affected countries (FAO, 2002). India had more than 33 million metric tons of grains stockpiled. Such grain could be purchased and transported for less than half the cost of grain shipped from the United States (Sharma, 2002). However, unlike European Union aid which is generally purchased from inside the affected region (so-called ‘‘triangular aid’’), the United States continues to rely almost exclusively on in-kind donations and financial aid tied to the purchase of American agricultural commod- ities. 7 The primary beneficiaries of such requirements are clearly American agricul- tural producers, for whom prices are maintained at artificially high levels. 8
Even inside the United States, maize is increasingly segregated according to GM content. According to a survey conducted by the American Corn Growers Associ- ation in 2001, over half of all US grain elevators segregated maize according to GM content (American Corn Growers Association, 2001). A similar study commis- sioned by Pioneer Hi-Bred, a leading producer of GM seed, found that nearly 20% of maize elevators refused to accept any GM seed whatsoever (Pioneer Hi-Bred International, 2000). Since 1999, Archer Daniels Midland, the largest US exporter of soya and maize, required its producers to segregate GM and non-GM crops (Reuters, 1999). And since the StarLink scandal in 2001, in which a GM maize variety not approved for human consumption due to potential allergenicity was found in the general food supply, the segregation of GM and non-GM maize has become a common practice for many American producers, handlers and exporters (Greenpeace, 2002). The decision of the US government to distribute GM food in aid packages in Southern Africa clearly was not the result of a lack of non-GM alternatives. Rather than the inability to source non-GM food aid, the decision to provide only genetically modified maize to Southern Africa reflected the unwillingness of USAID to engage in any discussion of the safety and desira- bility to GMOs in the region.
US agencies also refused to mill GM maize before distribution. According to them, milling of aid would increase the cost of food aid and reduce its shelf-life by making it more susceptible to pests. But recipients repeatedly stressed the importance
7 The information sheet produced by the US Department of State to defend American food aid policies in Southern Africa makes a halfhearted attempt to defend this policy. When asked ‘‘Why doesnÕt the US donate cash instead of food to food aid programs?’’, it replies that, ‘‘The United States is able to grow food in enormous capacities. As the worldÕs largest food exporter, the United States gives most of its food assistance Ôin-kind.Õ That is, we send US-produced food commodities abroad and have done so for nearly 50 years. US farmers have widely accepted bio-engineered corn and soy varieties for their environmental and economic benefits’’ (US Department of State, 2002, np).
8 In an oft-cited quotation, USAID acknowledges that, ‘‘The principle beneficiary of AmericaÕs foreign assistance has always been the United States. . . Foreign assistance programs have helped the United States by creating major export markets for agricultural goods, new markets for industrial exports, and hundreds of thousands of American jobs’’ (USAID, 1997, p. 4). For a more detailed discussion, see Diven (2001).
 
602 N. Zerbe / Food Policy 29 (2004) 593–608
of milling maize before distribution. By milling maize, farmers would be unable to replant seed distributed as aid, thereby ensuring that GM maize would not under- mine the production of local varieties or endanger access to European markets. For USAID, however, milling was entirely unnecessary. ‘‘Starving people do not plant seeds. They eat them!’’ argued USAID head Andrew Natsios (GRAIN, 2002). But as experience in Mexico demonstrates, farmers will plant GM varieties received as aid, and the new varieties will interbreed with local varieties. 9
The potential of GM seed received as food aid to cross with local crop varieties was a central concern of recipient countries. Indeed, the call to mill maize seed before distribution, rejected by the US as excessively costly and unnecessary, was intended to reduce precisely this risk. Washington, however, failed both to understand the nature of the concern of the governments of the region and to take them seriously. For Washington, the choice was simple: either accept US food aid unconditionally, or allow your population to starve. For the governments of the region, however, the matter was far more complex. For them, the decision to accept US assistance in the form of GM food aid represented a trade off, not just between the potential short and long term health of their populations, but between the short and long term health of their economies. Although the governments of the region were concerned with the unproven health consequences of consumption of GM maize, the decision of all the states of the region except Zambia to accept milled GM maize demon- strated that the potential health consequences of GM food consumption were less of a consideration than the potential environmental and trade impacts of unintended and unregulated GM production. Some observers were still worried about the un- tested health effects of GM food, particularly under the conditions in Southern Afri- ca. For them, US assurances that Americans had been consuming GM maize since 1996 did not absolve the potential negative effects of GM maize consumption in Southern Africa, because the conditions of consumption were fundamentally differ- ent. The limited tests conducted on the safety of GM maize consumption in the Uni- ted States did not adequately represent the lived conditions in Southern Africa. First, the quantity of maize consumed in the region far exceeds anything consumed by Americans. Across Southern Africa, maize meal represents the primary staple food, consumed in large quantities at every meal. In the United States, by contrast, maize consumption is fairly limited. Critics of biotechnology in Southern Africa argued that the sheer volume of maize consumed by Southern Africans meant that they were exposed to far greater quantities of GM food (and therefore far greater levels of potential risk) than the tests conducted in the United States. Second, and more importantly, biotechÕs critics argued that the effects of consuming GM maize under the near-famine conditions in Southern Africa were vastly different than under the normal conditions of plenty in the United States. The metabolization of food in
9 During the food aid crisis, the FAO was criticized for not taking the threat to local genetic diversity seriously enough. The FAO argued that, unlike Mexico, where maize originated, the danger of the unchecked spread of new breeds to local biodiversity in Southern Africa was not particularly important: ‘‘Maize is known for its propensity to outcross, but this is less of a concern in Southern Africa where there is no large genetic diversity of this crop’’ (cited in GRAIN, 2002, np).
 
N. Zerbe / Food Policy 29 (2004) 593–608 603
the human body may differ when that body is subject to the stress of hunger and famine. They argued that no tests had been conducted to ensure that the consump- tion of GM maize under such conditions was safe.
But the decision to accept unmilled GM maize represented a more general threat as well. The economies of Southern Africa, particularly Zambia and Zimba- bwe, have developed close ties to European markets, and the bulk of agricultural exports from the region are destined for the EU. European consumers have repeat- edly expressed distaste for genetically modified foodstuffs. And they have the money to pay a premium for organic agriculture. The potential cultivation of genetically modified seed (especially maize), either accidentally through spills or cross-pollination or through intentional cultivation of such crop varieties by South- ern African farmers eager to replant their fields after the drought, endangered re- gional exports of non-GM crops to Europe. Yet US policy makers initially seemed to be oblivious to concerns about export markets, and the need for the govern- ments of the region to maintain a degree of economic viability and vitality after the crisis.
USAID had failed to anticipate any challenge to the inclusion of GM food in aid shipments. Indeed, at the height of the crisis, the assistant administrator for USAID, Roger Winter, conceded that, ‘‘We were not aware that this [GM food aid] suddenly was going to emerge as such a heavy impediment to a timely response in the region’’ (Robinson, 2002: np). USAID argued that Mozambique and Zambia had, like much of Latin America, accepted US food aid shipments for years without challenge. Sim- ilarly, the US Department of Agriculture argued that it was impossible to predict the policies of recipient states regarding GM food aid because of non-transparent deci- sion-making structures and processes (GAO, 2003, p. 30). But challenges to trade in biotech crops had been raised at both the national and regional level. Zimbabwe, for example, had raised concerns regarding the potential adverse environmental and trade impact of biotech products as early as 2001, and both the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Organization of African States (OAS) had actively been developing a strong regulatory framework for biotech crops for over five years.
The concerns regarding the unregulated cultivation of GM crops in local produc- tion through the importation of GM seed as food aid were only resolved after South Africa – itself a significant producer of genetically modified foods – agreed to inter- vene and mill US food aid shipments before distribution. Following this concession, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe agreed to accept milled food aid for distribution.
Zambia, however, continued to resist. It refused to accept any GM food aid, even if milled, from the United States. Consequently, it became a focal point for tensions and accusations between advocates of biotechnology in the United States and critics of biotechnology in non-governmental organizations and the European Union. American and European trade disputes over genetically modified foods, which made their way to the World Trade Organization in May 2003, were central. Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa positioned himself domestically as the champion of Zambian sovereignty: ‘‘We may be poor and experiencing food shortages,’’ he said,

604 N. Zerbe / Food Policy 29 (2004) 593–608
‘‘but are not ready to expose people to ill-defined risks. . . I am not prepared to accept that we should use our people as guinea pigs’’ (cited in Cauvain, 2002, np).
Outside the region, tensions between the United States and the European Union escalated. The United States argued that EuropeÕs refusal to certify the safety of genetically modified foods made the EU culpable in the African food crisis. Although the EU publicly stated that the decision of African governments to accept GM food aid would not endanger future exports to Europe, the EU officially refused to state that GM foods were safe. The European Union maintained that the decision on whether to accept GM food aid had to be made by African governments in con- sultation with the United States.
According to Robert Zoellick, US Trade Representative, the EUÕs refusal to reas- sure hesitant African governments about the safety of biotechnology exacerbated the crisis, ultimately providing justification for the filing of the World Trade Organiza- tion case by the United States. Zoellick argued that, ‘‘This dangerous effect of the EUÕs moratorium became painfully evident last fall when some famine-stricken Afri- can countries refused US food aid because of fabricated fears stoked by irresponsible rhetoric about food safety.’’ For the United States, African caution regarding GMOs stemmed directly from the resistance of European consumers to food biotechnology. American officials went on the offensive. In a speech before the Biotechnology Indus- try Organization in Washington, DC, President George Bush dismissed European concerns over GMOs as being based on ‘‘unsound, unscientific fears,’’ and argued that the EU moratorium ‘‘has caused many African nations to avoid investing in biotechnologies for fear that their products will be shut out of European markets’’ (cited in BBC, 2003, np).
In its response to the US decision to file a case before the World Trade Organi- zation, the European Commission on 17 June 2003 dismissed the criticisms raised by the United States. The statement is worth citing at length:
Food aid to starving populations should be about meeting the urgent human- itarian needs of those who are in need. It should not be about trying to advance the case for GM food abroad, or planting GM crops for export, or indeed find- ing outlets for domestic surplus, which is a regrettable aspect of the US food aid policy. In the Southern African food crisis, the US has even refused to fund milling costs, as requested by Zimbabwe and Mozambique in order to avoid any possible concern about the spread of transgenes in those countries... The EU policy is to source food aid for emergency situation as much as pos- sible in the region, thus contributing to the development of local markets, pro- viding additional incentives for producers and ensuring that products distributed closely match local consumption habits. (EC, 2003, np).
While a complete analysis of the WTO case over the European Union morato- rium on the approval of new GMOs falls outside the scope of this paper, it is impor- tant to note that the US decision to file the case only served to highlight the lack of understanding American policy makers had both of the apprehension of European consumers towards agricultural biotechnology and the complexity of the decision making environment in Africa regarding the acceptance of GM food aid. Regardless

N. Zerbe / Food Policy 29 (2004) 593–608 605
of the decision at the World Trade Organization, Europe is unlikely to accept the current generation of GM food, which offers few benefits to the consumer. Already startled by a number of crises involving the safety of food, European consumers steadfastly and overwhelmingly oppose the introduction of genetically modified crops. Even in the United Kingdom, probably the most pro-biotech of European countries, popular opinion has forced supermarket chains to refuse to carry GM foods, and an inquiry commissioned by the government and a long consultative process with the general public has concluded that GM crops carry uncertain risks to the environment. The EU has already proven its willingness to reject WTO deci- sions where there is scientific uncertainty regarding the potential health effects of a product and strong public support for the continued moratorium (as, for example, in the case of bovine growth hormone, where the EU has accepted the imposition of countervailing sanctions against some of its exports to maintain the moratorium on BGH) (Levidow and Susan, 2000). The implementation of the Cartagena Proto- col on Biosafety, the ‘‘precautionary principle,’’ which permits the regulation of GMOs in the context of scientific uncertainty regarding the risks of such organisms, only strengthens the EUÕs position. There is therefore little reason to believe that EU policy vis-a`-vis agricultural biotechnology would be fundamentally different (Levi- dow, 2000).
Neither did the United States appreciate the position of African governments. The decision to reject unmilled US food aid in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and to reject all GM food aid in Zambia, was not simply the result of the pressure of spe- cial interests in the European Union. African governments were not the unknowing and unwilling pawns in the advancement of the agendas of various non-governmen- tal organizations in Europe. In rejecting US food aid containing GMOs, African governments were operating in the best interest of their countries in the context of the current international political economy. They were attempting to ensure the long-term viability of their economies, centered on agricultural production, in an international economic environment where the deck is stacked against them. Unable to compete with the huge subsidies afforded farmers in the United States and the European Union, African governments were attempting to develop specialized pro- duction in non-GM and certified organic agriculture. 10 Given the premium paid for such crops, not just in the European Union but also in Japan and the United States, the decision to accept or reject American food aid had to balance the short term sur- vival of large portions of the population against the long term survival of the econ- omy. American refusal to mill GM maize before its introduction only served to make this decision unnecessarily difficult.
10 Farm subsidies in the United States and the European Union have increased under the World Trade Organization, despite a commitment from both to reduce subsidies. According to the OECD, the United States provided $24 billion to agriculture in 1999, accounting for half of all farm income. The level of farm subsidies was increased under the 2002 farm bill. The European Union provides subsidies at similar levels to its farmers under the Common Agriculture Program (OECD, 2000; Zerbe and Carol, 2002).
 
606 N. Zerbe / Food Policy 29 (2004) 593–608 Conclusion: US food aid policies revisited
Despite resort to humanitarian rhetoric in its attack of European Union policy, the food aid distributed by the United States during the 2002 food crisis in Southern Africa demonstrates the continuing focus on the expansion of American policy objectives which marked earlier aid programs. The steadfast refusal to mill GM maize before distribution as food aid in particular highlights the ways in which American food aid was intended to serve specific American policy objectives. Indeed, three areas in which the decision to send food aid to Southern African advanced American goals can readily be identified: surplus disposal, market development, and foreign policy considerations. Let us briefly consider each.
Surplus disposal
Following the introduction of genetically modified maize in the United States in 1996, maize exports to Europe collapsed. From a peak value of $305 million in 1995, maize exports to the EU collapsed to just $2 million in 2001 (USDA, 2003). The in- creased competition for European markets from non-GM producers left the United States with large quantities of surplus maize which it was unable to sell on interna- tional markets. Export to Africa under the banner of food aid disposed of (an admit- tedly small portion of) the growing maize surplus (Vidal, 2002).
Market development
While surplus disposal played only a minor role in US policy during the food crisis, longer-term market development was more central. USAID has a long his- tory of promoting agricultural biotechnology in Africa. Indeed, the agency has made it its mission to ‘‘assist developing countries in building the framework for decision-making that will facilitate access to these opportunities the science [of bio- technology] holds and will ensure the safe and effective application of this technol- ogy’’ (USAID, 2003, np). However, Africa has been at the forefront of challenging the expansion of agricultural biotechnology, and especially of the proprietary sys- tem of patent rights that surrounds it—opposition most clearly articulated in the African Model Law on plant genetic resources (Zerbe, 2003). But, for USAID, the food crisis represented an opportunity to expand the promotion of biotechnol- ogy on the continent. Faced with the choice of importing GM food aid or allowing their populations to starve, USAID was banking on the governments of Southern Africa to choose GM food.
Foreign policy objectives
As noted above, US biotech corporations had been locked out of Europe since the EU imposed its moratorium on the approval of new GM crops. With no sign of the moratorium being lifted, the United States chose to pursue a more aggressive strat- egy. In exporting unmilled GM maize to Africa, it seems as if the US was hoping to

N. Zerbe / Food Policy 29 (2004) 593–608 607
expand the cultivation of GM crops in Africa, thereby isolating Europe and under- mining its opposition to agricultural biotechnology in international fora. The more countries cultivating GM crops, the more likely US pressure on the European Union (either backdoor diplomacy or public pressure through the World Trade Organiza- tion) would be successful. Either way, European markets would again be opened to US maize exports.
But the United States failed to anticipate the strength of African opposition to GM food aid. By demanding that US food aid be milled before distribution, African governments were not simply giving into misguided European fears over agricultural biotechnology. Rather, they were attempting to secure the long-term economic via- bility of their agricultural sectors. Unable to compete directly against American and European farmers who are heavily subsidized and protected by their governments, African farmers were responding to European demands for non-GM agriculture through specialized production. The importation of GM seed would have under- mined their capacity to engage in such specialized production, cutting off an impor- tant source of foreign exchange, particularly for Zambia and Zimbabwe. By failing to recognize the importance of non-GM production for the future health and vitality of the economies of Southern Africa, and by demanding that countries accept US food aid unconditionally in an effort to promote its own foreign policy and commer- cial objectives, the US policy exacerbated the food crisis. What should have been a routine food relief operation became a highly charged debate over the future of agri- cultural biotechnology not just in Africa but around the world.

   ABSTRACT
This paper updates previous assessments of the environmental impacts associated with using crop biotechnology (specifically genetically modified crops) in global agriculture. It focuses on the environmental impacts associated with changes in pesticide use and greenhouse gas emissions arising from the use of GM crops since their first widespread commercial use 22 years ago. The adoption of GM insect resistant and herbicide tolerant technology has reduced pesticide spraying by 775.4 million kg (8.3%) and, as a result, decreased the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on these crops (as measured by the indicator, the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ)) by 18.5%. The technology has also facilitated important cuts in fuel use and tillage changes, resulting in a significant reduction in the release of greenhouse gas emissions from the GM cropping area. In 2018, this was equivalent to removing 15.27 million cars from the roads.
Introduction
GM crop technology has been widely used for more than 20 years in a number of countries and is mainly found in the four crops of canola, maize, cotton and soybean. In 2018, crops containing this type of technology accounted for 48% of the global plantings of these four crops. In addition, small areas of GM sugar beet (adopted in the USA and Canada since 2008), papaya (in the USA since 1999 and China since 2008), alfalfa (in the US initially in 2005–2007 and then from 2011), squash (in the USA since 2004), apples (in the USA since 2016), potatoes (in the USA since 2015) and brin- jal (in Bangladesh since 2015) have been planted.
The main traits so far commercialized convey:
● Tolerance to specific herbicides (notably to glyphosate and to glufosinate and since 2016 tolerance to additional active ingredients like 2 4 D and dicamba) in maize, cotton, canola (spring oilseed rape), soybean, sugar beet and alfalfa. This GM Herbicide Tolerant (GM HT) technology allows for the ‘over the top’ spraying of GM HT crops with these specific broad-spectrum herbicides, that target both

● Resistance to specific insect pests of maize,
cotton, soybeans and brinjal. This GM insect resistance (GM IR), or ‘Bt’ technology offers farmers resistance in the plants to major pests such as stem and stalk borers, earworms, cut- worms and rootworm (eg, Ostrinia nubilalis, Ostrinia furnacalis, Spodoptera frugiperda, Diatraea spp, Helicoverpa zea and Diabrotica spp) in maize, bollworm/budworm (Heliothis sp and Helicoverpa) in cotton, caterpillars (Helicoverpa armigeru) in soybeans and the fruit and shoot borer (Leucinodes orbanalis) in brinjal. Instead of applying insecticide for pest control, a very specific and safe insecti- cide is delivered via the plant itself through ‘Bt’ gene expression.
In addition, the GM papaya and squash referred to above are resistant to important viruses (eg, ring- spot in papaya), the GM apples are non-browning and the GM potatoes (planted in 2016) have low asparagine (low acrylamide which is a potential carcinogen) and reduced bruising.

This paper presents an assessment of some of the key environmental impacts associated with the global adoption of these GM traits. The environ- mental impact analysis focuses on:
● Changes in the amount of insecticides and herbicides applied to the GM crops relative to conventionally grown alternatives and;
● The contribution of GM crops toward reducing global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.
It is widely accepted that increases in atmo- spheric levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are detrimental to the global environment (see for example, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.1) Therefore, if the adoption of crop biotechnology contributes to a reduction in the level of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, this represents a positive development for the world.
The study integrates data for 2018 into the context of earlier developments and updates the findings of earlier analysis presented by the authors (eg, Brookes and Barfoot.2)
The methodology and approach in this pre- sent discussion are unchanged to allow a direct comparison of the new with earlier data. Readers should however, note that some data presented in this paper are not directly comparable with data presented in previous analysis because the current paper takes into account new data (including revisions to data for earlier years). Also, in order to save readers’, the chore of consulting earlier papers for details of the meth- odology and arguments, these elements are included in full in this updated paper.
The aim has been to provide an up to date and as accurate as possible assessment of some of the key environmental impacts associated with the global adoption of GM crops. It is also hoped the analysis continues to make a contribution to greater understanding of the impact of this technology and facilitates more informed decision-making, especially in coun- tries where crop biotechnology is currently not permitted.
Results and Discussion
Results: Environmental Impacts of Insecticide and Herbicide Use Changes
HT Crops
A key impact of GM HT (largely tolerant to gly- phosate) technology use has been a change in the profile of herbicides typically used. In general, a fairly broad range of, mostly selective (grass weed and broad-leaved weed) herbicides has been replaced by one or two broad-spectrum herbicides (mostly glyphosate) used in conjunction with a small number of other (complementary) herbi- cides (eg, 2 4,D). This has resulted in:
● Aggregate reductions in both the volume of her- bicides used (in terms of weight of active ingre- dient applied) and the associated field EIQ values when compared to usage on conventional (non- GM) crops in some countries, indicating net improvements to the environment (see Table 1 for an example). For an explanation of the EIQ indicator, see the methodology section;
● In other countries, the average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to GM

 HT crops represents a net increase relative to usage on the conventional crop alternative. However, even though the amount of active ingredient use has increased, in terms of the associated environmental impact, as mea- sured by the EIQ indicator, the environmen- tal profile of the GM HT crop has commonly been better than its conventional equivalent – see for example, Table 2;
● Where GM HT crops (tolerant to glyphosate) have been widely grown, incidences of weed resistance to glyphosate have occurred (see additional discussion below) and have become a major problem in some regions (see www.weedscience.org). This can be attributed to how glyphosate was originally used with GM HT crops, where because of its highly effective, broad-spectrum post- emergence activity, it was often used as the sole method of weed control. This approach to weed control put tremendous selection pressure on weeds and as a result contributed to the evolution of weed populations domi- nated by resistant individuals. In addition, the

facilitating role of GM HT technology5,6 in the adoption of no tillage (NT: where the ground is not plowed at all) and reduced tillage (RT: where the ground is disturbed but less than it would be with traditional plow-based tillage systems) production tech- niques in North and South America has probably contributed to the emergence of weeds resistant to herbicides like glyphosate and to weed shifts toward those weed species that are not inherently well controlled by glyphosate. As a result, over the last 15 years, growers of GM HT crops have been (and are increasingly being) advised to use other herbicides (with different and com- plementary modes of action) in combination with glyphosate and in some cases adopting cultural practices (eg, revert to plowing) in more integrated weed management systems.7,8 Also, in the last 2–3 years, GM HT crops tolerant to additional herbicides (typically providing multiple tolerances in a crop) such as 2 4 D, dicamba and glufosi- nate have become available. At the macro level, these changes have influenced the mix, total amount, cost and overall profile of her- bicides applied to GM HT crops. This means that compared to the early 2000s, the amount and number of herbicide active ingredient used with GM HT crops in most regions has increased, and the associated environmental profile, as measured by the EIQ indicator, deteriorated. This increase in herbicide use is often cited by GM technology opponents (eg, Benbrook9) as an environmental failing of the technology. However, what such authors fail to acknowledge is that the amount of herbicide used on conventional crops has also increased over the same time period and that compared to the conventional alternative, the environmental profile of GM HT crop use has continued to represent an improvement compared to the conventional alternative (as measured by the EIQ indicator (see for example, Fig. 1 and Brookes and Barfoot.2) It should also be noted that many of the herbicides used in conventional pro- duction systems had significant resistance issues themselves in the mid 1990s and this

was one of the reasons why glyphosate toler- ant soybean technology was rapidly adopted, as glyphosate provided good control of these weeds.
These points are further illustrated in the analysis below which examines changes in herbicide use by crop over the period 1996–2018 and specifically for the latest year examined, 2018.
GM HT Soybean
The environmental impact of herbicide use change associated with GM HT soybean adoption between 1996 and 2018 is summarized in Table 3. Overall,
Table 3. GM HT soybean: summary of active ingredient usage and associated EIQ changes 1996–2018.
there has been a small net increase in the amount of herbicide active ingredient used (+0.1%), which equates to 5 million kg more active ingredient applied to these crops than would otherwise have occurred if a conventional crop had been planted. However, the environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator, improved by 12.9% due to the increased usage of more environmentally benign herbicides.
At the country level, some user countries recorded both a net reduction in the use of herbi- cide active ingredient and an improvement in the associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator. Others, such as Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay have seen net increases in the amount of herbicide active ingredient applied, though the overall environmental impact, as mea- sured by the EIQ indicator has improved. The largest environmental gains have tended to be in developed countries where the usage of herbicides has traditionally been highest and where there has been a significant movement away from the use of several selective herbicides to one broad spectrum herbicide initially, and in the last few years, plus complementary herbicides, with different modes of action, targeted at weeds that are difficult to control with glyphosate.
In 2018, the amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to the global GM HT soybean crop increased by 6.8 million kg (+2.4%) relative to the amount reasonably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional cultivars. This highlights

 the point above relating to recent increases in herbi- cide use with GM HT crops to take account of weed resistance issues. However, despite these increases in the volume of active ingredient used, in EIQ terms, the environmental impact of the 2018 GM HT soy- bean crop continued to represent an improvement relative to the conventional alternative (a 10.6% improvement).
GM HT Maize
The adoption of GM HT maize has resulted in a significant reduction in the volume of herbicide active ingredient usage (−242 million kg of active ingredient) and an improvement in the associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator, between 1996 and 2018 (Table 4).
In 2018, the reduction in herbicide usage rela- tive to the amount reasonably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional cultivars was 1.8 million kg of active ingredient (−0.9%), with a larger environmental improvement, as mea- sured by the EIQ indicator of 8.4%. As with GM HT soybeans, the greatest environmental gains have been in developed countries (eg, the US and Canada), where the usage of herbicides has tradi- tionally been highest.
GM HT Cotton
The use of GM HT cotton delivered a net reduction in herbicide active ingredient use of 39.5 million kg over the 1996–2018 period (Table 5). This represents

In terms of the EIQ indicator, this represents a 17.7% environmental improvement.
Other HT Crops
GM HT canola (tolerant to glyphosate or glufosi- nate) has been grown in Canada, the US, and more recently Australia. GM HT sugar beet is grown in the US and Canada. The environmental impacts associated with changes in herbicide usage on these crops in the period 1996–2018 are summar- ized in Table 6. GM HT canola use has resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of herbicide active ingredient used relative to the amount rea- sonably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional canola. Its use has also resulted in a net environmental improvement of 31.4%, as measured by the EIQ indicator.
In respect of GM HT sugar beet, the adoption of GM HT technology has resulted in a change in herbicide usage away from several applications of selective herbicides to fewer applications of, typi- cally, a single herbicide (glyphosate). Over the period 2008–2018, the widespread use of GM HT technology in the US and Canadian sugar beet crops has resulted in a net reduction in the total volume of herbicides applied to the sugar beet crop relative to the amount reasonably expected

species resistant to glyphosate of which many are not associated with glyphosate tolerant crops (Heap I International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds -www.weedscience.org). This dataset shows that in the US, there are currently 17 weeds recognized as exhibiting resistance to glyphosate, of which two are not associated with glyphosate tolerant crops. In addition, it shows that some of the first glyphosate resistant weeds developed in Australia in the mid 1990s before the adoption of GM HT crops and currently there are 19 weeds exhibiting resistance to glyphosate in Australia, even though the area using GM HT (tolerant to glyphosate) crops in the country is relatively small (about 0.8 million ha in 2018). In Argentina, Brazil and Canada, where GM HT crops are widely grown, the number of weed species exhibiting resistance to glyphosate are respectively 15, 9 and 6. Some glyphosate-resistant species, such as marestail (Conyza canadensis), waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) and palmer pigweed (Amaranthus palmeri) in the US, are now wide- spread, with the affected area being possibly within a range of 50%-75% of the total area annually devoted to maize, cotton and soybeans.
This resistance development should, however, be placed in context. All weeds have the ability to develop resistance to all herbicides and there are hundreds of resistant weed species confirmed in the International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds (I Heap, as above found at www. weedscience.org). This dataset also reports that herbicide resistant weeds pre-date the use of GM HT crops by decades and that there are, for exam- ple, 165 weed species that are resistant to ALS herbicides (eg, imazethapyr, cloransulam methyl) and 74 weed species resistant to photosystem II inhibitor herbicides (eg, atrazine).
Where farmers are faced with the existence of weeds resistant to glyphosate in GM HT crops, they are advised to be proactive and include other herbicides (with different and complemen- tary modes of action) in combination with glypho- sate and in some cases to adopt cultural practices such as plowing in their integrated weed manage- ment systems.5,6 This change in weed management emphasis also reflects the broader agenda of devel- oping strategies across all forms of cropping sys- tems to minimize and slow down the potential for weeds developing resistance to existing technology

In Australia, one of the most popular type of production has been
canola tolerant to the triazine group of herbicides (tolerance derived from non-GM techniques). It is relative to this form of canola that the main farm income benefits of GM HT (to glyphosate) canola has occurred
InVigor’ hybrid vigor canola (tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate) is higher yielding than conventional or other GM HT canola and derives this additional vigor from GM techniques
GM HT alfalfa is also grown in the US. The changes in herbicide use and associated environmental impacts from use of this technology is not included due to a lack of available data on herbicide use in alfalfa
if this crop area had been planted to conventional sugar beet (Table 6). The net impact on the envir- onment, as measured by the EIQ indicator has been a 19% reduction in the EIQ value.
In 2018, the use of GM HT canola resulted in a 6.0 million kg reduction in the amount of herbi- cide active ingredient use (−42%) relative to the amount reasonably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional canola. More signifi- cantly, there was an improvement in associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator of 42.5%. The use of GM HT technology resulted in a decrease 65,600 kg of herbicide active ingredient being applied to the sugar beet crops in the US and Canada (−5%) relative to the amount reasonably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional sugar beet. This also resulted in a net improvement in the associated environmental impact (−5%) as measured by the EIQ indicator.
Weed Resistance
As indicated above, weed resistance to glyphosate has become a major issue affecting some farmers using GM HT (tolerant to glyphosate) crops. Worldwide there are currently (accessed March 2020) 48 weeds

 solutions for their control. In addition, as referred to earlier, GM HT crops tolerant to other herbi- cides (often stacked with glyphosate) have also become available from 2016 in some countries (notably to dicamba and 2 4 D in the USA). At the macro level, these changes have influenced the mix, total amount, cost and overall profile of her- bicides applied to GM HT crops in the last 15 years.
For example, in the 2018 US GM HT soybean crop, approximately two-thirds of the crop area was planted to varieties that were tolerant to other herbicides (in addition to tolerance to glyphosate) and even where single tolerance-traited crops were planted, almost all of these crops received an addi- tional herbicide treatment of other active ingredients (notably sulfentrazone, S metolachlor, 2 4 D, metri- buzin, cloransulam methyl and clethodim). This compares with only 14% of the GM HT soybean crop (almost all tolerant to only glyphosate) receiv- ing a treatment of one of the next four most used herbicide active ingredients (after glyphosate) in 2006. As a result, the average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to the GM HT soybean crop in the US (per hectare) increased by 90% over this period. The increase in non-glyphosate herbi- cide use was primarily in response to public and private sector weed scientist recommendations to diversify weed management programmes and not to rely on a single herbicide mode of action for total weed management. It is interesting to note that by 2016, glyphosate accounted for a lower share of total active ingredient use on the GM HT crop (63%) than in 1998 when it accounted for 82% of total active ingredient use, highlighting that farm- ers continued to realize value in using glyphosate because of its broad-spectrum activity in addition to using other herbicides in line with integrated weed management advice. This continues in 2018, with the availability of additional options for weed control via varieties with GM HT tolerance to other herbicides. Whilst alternatives to glyphosate tolerant varieties are available, the vast majority used are tolerant to glyphosate and other herbicides.
On the small conventional crop, the average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied doubled over the period 2006–2018, which in per- centage terms is greater than the rate of increase in use on the GM HT crop (+71%) over the same
period. This increase in usage largely reflected a shift in herbicides used rather than increased dose rates for some herbicides. The increase in the use of herbicides on the conventional soybean crop in the US can also be mainly attributed to the on-going development of weed resistance to non-glyphosate herbicides commonly used and highlights that the development of weed resistance to herbicides is a problem faced by all farmers, regardless of produc- tion method.
Relative to the conventional alternative, the envir- onmental profile of GM HT crop use has, never- theless, continued to offer important advantages and in most cases, provides an improved environ- mental profile compared to the conventional alter- native (as measured by the EIQ indicator).
GM IR Crops
The main way in which these technologies have impacted on the environment has been through reduced insecticide use between 1996 and 2018 (Tables 7 and 8) with the GM IR technology effec- tively replacing insecticides used to control impor- tant crop pests. This is particularly evident in respect of cotton, which traditionally has been a crop on which intensive treatment regimes of insecticides were common place to control boll- worm/budworm pests. In maize, the insecticide

In 2018, IR soybeans were in their sixth year of commercial use in South America (mostly Brazil). During this period (2013–2018), the insecticide use (active ingredient) saving relative to the amount reasonably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional soybeans was 14.9 million kg (8.2% of total soybean insecticide use), with an associated environmental benefit, as measured by the EIQ indicator saving of 8.6% (Table 9).
Aggregated (Global Level) Impacts
At the global level, GM technology has contributed to a significant reduction in the negative environ- mental impact associated with insecticide and her- bicide use on the areas devoted to GM crops. Since 1996, the use of pesticides on the GM crop area has fallen by 775.4 million kg of active ingredient (an 8.3% reduction) relative to the amount reason- ably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional crops. The environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on these crops, as measured by the EIQ indicator, improved by 18.5%. In 2018, the environmental benefit was equal to a reduction of 51.7 million kg of pesticide active ingredient use (−8.6%), with the environmental impact associated with insecticide

use savings have been more limited because the pests that the various technology targets tend to be less widespread in maize than budworm/bollworm pests are in cotton. In addition, insecticides were widely considered to have limited effectiveness against some pests in maize crops (eg, stalk borers) because the pests occur where sprays are not effec- tive (eg, inside stalks). As a result of these factors, the proportion of the maize crop in most GM IR user countries that typically received insecticide treatments before the availability of GM IR tech- nology was much lower than the share of the cotton crops receiving insecticide treatments (eg, in the US, no more than 10% of the maize crop typically received insecticide treatments targeted at stalk boring pests and about 30%-40% of the crop annually received treatments for rootworm).
The global insecticide savings from using GM IR maize and cotton in 2018 were 8.3 million kg (−82% of insecticides typically targeted at maize stalk boring and rootworm pests) and 20.9 million kg (−55% of all insecticides used on cotton) respectively of active ingredient use relative to the amounts reasonably expected if these crop areas had been planted to conventional maize and cotton. In EIQ indictor terms, the respective environmental improvements in 2018 were 88% associated with insecticide use targeted at maize

At the country level, US farms have seen the largest environmental benefits, with a 404 million kg reduc- tion in pesticide active ingredient use (52% of the total). This is not surprising given that US farmers were first to make widespread use of GM crop tech- nology, and for several years, the GM adoption levels in all four US crops have been in excess of 80%, and insecticide/herbicide use has, in the past been, the primary method of weed and pest control. Important environmental benefits have also occurred in China and India from the adoption of GM IR cotton, with a reduction in insecticide active ingredi- ent use of over 276 million kg (1996–2018).
Results: Greenhouse Gas Emission Savings
Reduced Fuel Use
The fuel savings associated with making fewer spray runs in GM IR crops of maize and cotton (relative to conventional crops) and the switch from Conventional Tillage (CT) to Reduced Tillage or No Tillage (RT/NT) farming systems facilitated by GM HT crops, have resulted in permanent savings in carbon dioxide emissions. In 2018, this amounted to a saving of 2,456 million kg of carbon dioxide, arising from reduced fuel use of 920 million liters (Table 10).
These savings are equivalent to taking 1.63 million cars off the road for one year.
The largest fuel use-related reductions in carbon dioxide emissions have come from the adoption of GM HT technology in soybeans and how it has facilitated a switch to RT/NT production systems with their reduced soil cultivation practices (78% of total savings 1996–2018). These savings have been greatest in South America.
Over the period 1996 to 2018, the cumulative permanent reduction in fuel use has been about 34,172 million kg of carbon dioxide, arising from reduced fuel use of 12,799 million liters. In terms of car equivalents, this is equal to taking 22.65 million cars off the road for a year.
Additional Soil Carbon Storage/Sequestration
As indicated earlier, the widespread adoption and maintenance of RT/NT production systems in North and South America, facilitated by GM HT crops (especially in soybeans) has improved growers’ abil- ity to control competing weeds, reducing the need to rely on soil cultivation and seed-bed preparation as means to getting good levels of weed control. As a result, as well as tractor fuel use for tillage being reduced, soil quality has been enhanced and levels of soil erosion cut. In turn, more carbon remains in the soil and this leads to lower GHG emissions.

Based on savings arising from the rapid adoption of RT/NT farming systems in North and South America, we estimate that an extra 5,606 million kg of soil carbon has been sequestered in 2018 (equiva- lent to 20,581 million kg of carbon dioxide that has not been released into the global atmosphere). These savings are equivalent to taking 13.6 million cars off the road for one year (Table 11).
The additional amount of soil carbon sequestered since 1996 has been equivalent to 302,364 million kg of carbon dioxide that has not been released into the global atmosphere. Readers should note that these estimates are based on fairly conservative assump- tions and therefore the true values could be higher. Also, some of the additional soil carbon sequestra- tion gains from RT/NT systems may be lost if sub- sequent plowing of the land occurs.
Estimating the possible losses that may arise from subsequent plowing would be complex and difficult to undertake. This factor should be taken into account when using the estimates presented in this paper. It should also be noted that this soil carbon saving is based on savings arising from the rapid adoption of RT/NT farming systems, for which the availability of GM HT technology, has been cited by many farmers as an important facil- itator. GM HT technology has therefore probably been an important contributor to this increase in soil carbon sequestration but is not the only factor of influence. Other influences such as the avail- ability of relatively cheap generic glyphosate (the
real price of glyphosate fell threefold between 1995 and 2000 once patent protection for the product expired) have also been important.
Cumulatively, the amount of carbon sequestered may be higher than these estimates due to year-on- year benefits to soil quality (eg, less soil erosion, greater water retention and reduced levels of nutri- ent run off). However, it is equally likely that the total cumulative soil sequestration gains have been lower because only a proportion of the crop area will have remained in NT/RT.
It is, nevertheless, not possible to confidently esti- mate cumulative soil sequestration gains that take into account reversions to conventional tillage because of a lack of data. Consequently, the estimate provided of 302,364 million kg of carbon dioxide not released into the atmosphere should be treated with caution.
Aggregating the carbon sequestration benefits from reduced fuel use and additional soil carbon storage, the total carbon dioxide savings in 2018 are equal to about 23,027 million kg, equivalent to taking 15.27 million cars off the road for a year. This is equal to 48% of registered cars in the UK.
Conclusions
GM crop technology has been used by many farmers around the world for more than twenty years and currently nearly 17 million farmers a year plant seeds containing this technology. This seed technology has

 helped farmers be more efficient with their applica- tion of crop protection products, which not only reduces their environmental impact, but saves time and money. The technology is also changing agricul- ture’s carbon footprint, helping farmers adopt more sustainable practices such as reduced tillage, which has decreased the burning of fossil fuels and allowed more carbon to be retained in the soil. This has led to a decrease in carbon emissions. In relation to GM HT crops, however, over reliance on the use of glyphosate by farmers, in some regions, has contrib- uted to the development of weed resistance. As a result, farmers have, over the last 15 years, adopted more integrated weed management strategies incor- porating a mix of herbicides and non-herbicide- based weed control practices. This means that the magnitude of the original environmental gains asso- ciated with changes in herbicide use with GM HT crops have diminished. Despite this, the adoption of GM HT crop technology in 2018 continues to deliver a net environmental gain relative to the conventional alternative and, together with GM IR technology, continues to provide substantial net environmental benefits. These findings are also consistent with ana- lysis by other authors (Klumper and Qaim12, Fernando-Cornejo J, et al.13)
Methodology
This analysis draws on a combination of existing literature and analysis by the authors of crop and country-specific farm level changes in husbandry practices and pesticide usage data. In particular, the analysis of pesticide usage changes with GM crops takes into consideration how farmers have made changes to weed control practices so as address weed resistance development to the main herbicide (glyphosate) used with GM HT crops.
Methodology: Environmental Impacts from Insecticide and Herbicide Use Changes
Assessment of the impact of GM crops on insecti- cide and herbicide use requires comparisons of the respective weed and pest control measures used on GM versus the ‘conventional alternative’ form of production. This presents a number of challenges relating to availability and representativeness.
Comparison data ideally derives from farm level surveys which collect usage data on the different forms of production. A search of the literature on insecticide or herbicide use change with GM crops shows that the number of studies exploring these issues is limited (eg, Qaim and Traxler14, Pray C15) with even fewer (eg, Brookes,16,17) providing data to the pesticide (active ingredient) level. Secondly, national level pesticide usage survey data is also limited; there are no published, detailed, annual pesticide usage surveys conducted by national authorities in any of the countries currently grow- ing GM crop traits and, the only country in which pesticide usage data is collected (by private market research companies) on an annual basis, and which allows a comparison between GM and con- ventional crops to be made, is the US. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducts pes- ticide usage surveys but these are not conducted on an annual basis for each crop (eg, the last time maize was included was 2018 and previous to this, in 2016, 2014, 2010 and 2005, for soybeans the last time included was 2018 and before that, 2015) and do not disaggregate usage by production type (GM versus conventional).
Even where national pesticide use survey data is available, it can be of limited value. Quantifying herbicide or insecticide usage changes with GM crop technology adoption requires an assessment of, not only what is currently used with GM crops, but also what herbicides/insecticides might reason- ably be expected to be used in the absence of crop biotechnology on the relevant crops (ie, if the entire crops used non-GM production methods). Applying usage rates for the current (remaining) conventional crops is one approach, however, this invariably under estimates what usage might reasonably be in the absence of crop biotechnology, because the con- ventional cropping dataset used relates to a relatively small, unrepresentative share of total crop area. This has been the case, for example, in respect of the US maize, canola, cotton and soybean crops for many years. Thus in 2018, the conventional share (not using GM HT technology) of each crop was only 6%, 8%, 6% and 1% respectively for soybean, maize, cotton and canola, with the conventional share hav- ing been below 50% of the total since 1999 in respect of the soybean crop, since 2001 for the cotton and

canola crops, and since 2007 for the maize crop (statistical source: USDA NASS 2019).
The reasons why herbicide/insecticide usage levels from this small conventional crop dataset is unrepresentative of what might reasonably be expected if all of the current area growing GM crops reverted to conventional seed types are:
● Although pest/weed problems/damage vary by year, region and within region, farmers’ who consistently farm conventionally may be those with relatively low levels of pest/weed problems, and hence see little, if any economic benefit from using the GM traits targeted at these pest/weed problems. In addition, late or non-adopters of new technology in agriculture are typically those who generally make less use of newer technologies than earlier adopters. As a result, insecticide/herbicide usage levels non- adopting farmers tend to be below the levels that would reasonably be expected on an aver- age farm with more typical pest/weed infesta- tions and where farmers are more wiling to adopt new technology;
● Some of the farms continuing to use conven- tional seed use extensive, low intensity pro- duction methods (including organic) which feature, limited (below average) use of herbi- cides/insecticides. The usage patterns of this sub-set of growers is therefore likely to understate usage for the majority of farmers if they all returned to farming without the use of GM technology;
● The widespread adoption of GM IR technol- ogy has resulted in ‘area-wide’ suppression of target pests in maize and cotton crops. As a result, conventional farmers (eg, of maize in the US) have benefited from this lower level of pest infestation and the associated reduced need to apply insecticides.18
● Some farmers have experienced improvements in pest/weed control with GM technology com- pared to the conventional control methods pre- viously used. If these farmers were to switch back to using conventional techniques, it is likely that most would want to maintain pest/ weed control levels obtained with GM traits and therefore some would use higher levels of insecticide/herbicide than they did in the pre-
GM crop days. Nevertheless, the decision to use more pesticide or not would be made according to individual assessment of the potential bene- fits (eg, from higher yields) compared to the cost of additional pesticide use.
The poor representativeness of the small conven- tional dataset has been addressed by firstly, using the average recorded values for insecticide/herbi- cide usage on conventional crops for years only when the conventional crop accounted for the majority of the total crop and, secondly, in other years (eg, from 1999 for soybeans, from 2001 for cotton and from 2007 for maize in the US) apply- ing estimates of the likely usage if the whole crop was no longer using crop biotechnology, based on opinion from extension and industry advisors across the country as to what farmers might rea- sonably be expected to do for pest and weed con- trol practices, including typical insecticide/ herbicide application rates. Lastly, these ‘extension service’ identified application rates were cross checked (and subject to adjustment) with recorded usage levels of key herbicide and insecticide active ingredients from pesticide usage surveys (where available) so as to minimize the chance of usage levels for the conventional alternative being over- stated. Overall, this approach has been applied in a number of countries where pesticide usage data is available, though in some, because of the paucity of available data, the analysis relies more on exten- sion/advisor opinion and knowledge of actual and potential pesticide use.
This methodology has been used by others (Sankala and Blumenthal19, Sankala and Blumenthal10, Johnson and Strom.11) It also has the advantage of providing comparisons of current crop protection practices on both GM crops and the conventional alternatives and so takes into account dynamic changes in crop protection and weed control management practices and technol- ogies (eg, to address weed resistance development) rather than making comparisons solely on past practices. Details of how this methodology has been applied to the 2018 calculations, sources used for each trait/country combination examined and examples of typical conventional versus GM pesticide applications are provided in Appendices AandB.

 The environmental impact associated with pes- ticide use changes with GM crops has most com- monly been presented in the literature in terms of the volume (quantity) of pesticide applied. This is, however, not a good measure of environmental impact because the toxicity of each pesticide is not directly related to the amount (weight) applied. There exist alternative (and better) measures that have been used by a number of authors of peer reviewed papers to assess the environmental impact of pesticide use change with GM crops. In particular, there are a number of peer reviewed papers that utilize the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) developed at Cornell University by Kovach et al20 and updated annually (eg, Brimner et al21, Kleiter22, Biden S et al.23) This effectively integrates the various environmental impacts of individual pesticides into a single ‘field value per hectare’. The EIQ value is multiplied by the amount of pesticide active ingredient (ai) used per hectare to produce a field EIQ value. For example, the EIQ rating for glyphosate is 15.33. By using this rating multiplied by the amount of glyphosate used per hectare (eg, a hypothetical example of 1.1 kg applied per ha), the field EIQ value for glyphosate would be equivalent to 16.86/ ha. The EIQ indicator used is therefore a comparison of the field EIQ/ha for conventional versus GM crop production systems, with the total environmental impact or load of each system, a direct function of respective field EIQ/ha values and the area planted to each type of production (GM versus conventional). The EIQ indicator pro- vides an improved assessment of the impact of GM crops on the environment when compared to only examining changes in volume of active ingredient applied, because it draws on some of the key toxi- city and environmental exposure data related to individual products, as applicable to impacts on farm workers, consumers and ecology.
The authors of this analysis have also used the EIQ indicator now for several years because it:
● Summarizes significant amounts of informa- tion on pesticide impact into a single value that, with data on usage rates (amount of active used per hectare) can be readily used to make comparisons between different
production systems across many regions and
countries;
● Provides an improved assessment of the
impact of GM crops on the environment when compared to only examining changes in volume of active ingredient applied, because it draws on some of the key toxicity and environmental exposure data related to individual products, as applicable to impacts on farm workers, consumers and ecology.
The authors, do, however acknowledge that the EIQ is only a hazard indicator and has important weaknesses (see for example, Peterson R and Schleier J24 and Kniss A and Coburn C.25) It is a hazard rating indicator that does not assess risk or probability of exposure to pesticides. It also relies on qualitative assumptions for the scaling and weighting of (quantitative) risk information that can result, for example, in a low risk rating for one factor (eg, impact on farm workers) may cancel out a high-risk rating factor for another factor (eg, impact on ecology). Fundamentally, assessing the full environmental impact of pesti- cide use changes with different production sys- tems is complex and requires an evaluation of risk exposure to pesticides at a site-specific level. This requires substantial collection of (site- specific) data (eg, on ground water levels, soil structure) and/or the application of standard sce- nario models for exposure in a number of loca- tions. Undertaking such an exercise at a global level would require a substantial and ongoing input of labor and time, if comprehensive envir- onmental impact of pesticide change analysis is to be completed. It is not surprising that no such exercise has, to date been undertaken, or is likely to be in the near future.
Despite the acknowledged weaknesses of the EIQ as an indictor of pesticide environmental impact, the authors of this paper continue to use it because it is, in our view, a superior indicator to only using amount of pesticide active ingredient applied. In this paper, the EIQ indicator is used in conjunction with examining changes in the volume of pesticide active ingredient applied.

Methodology: Impact of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Assessment of the impact of GM crop use on greenhouse gas emissions combines reviews of lit- erature relating to fuel use and tillage systems, coupled with evidence of how GM crop usage has impacted on fuel use and tillage systems. Reductions in the level of GHG emissions asso- ciated with an increase in the area of NT/RT tillage and the adoption of GM crops are acknowledged in a wide body of literature.5,6,26–31
First, GM crops contribute to a reduction in fuel use from less frequent herbicide or insecticide applications and a reduction in the energy use in soil cultivation. For both herbicide and insecticide applications, the quantity of energy required to apply the pesticides depends upon the application method. For example, in the US, a typical method of application is with a 90-foot boom sprayer which consumes approximately 0.84 liters/ha.32 In terms of GHG, each liter of tractor diesel con- sumed contributes an estimated 2.67 kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (so one less applica- tion reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 2.24 kg/ ha). Given that many farmers apply insecticides via sprayers pulled by tractors, which use higher levels of fuel than self-propelled boom sprayers, these estimates for reductions in carbon emissions, which are based on self-propelled boom applica- tion, probably understate the carbon benefits.
In addition, there has been a shift from CT to RT/ NT. No-till farming means that the ground is not plowed at all, while reduced tillage means that the ground is disturbed less than it would be with tradi- tional tillage systems. For example, under a no-till farming system, soybean seeds are planted through the organic material that is left over from a previous crop such as corn, cotton or wheat) facilitated by GM HT technology (see for example, CTIC5) and American Soybean Association6, especially where soy- bean growing and/or a soybean: corn rotation are commonplace. Before the introduction of GM HT technology, RT/NT systems were practised by some farmers with varying degrees of success using a number of herbicides, though in many cases,
a reversion to CT was common after a few years due to poor levels of weed control. The availability of GM HT technology provided growers with an opportunity to control weeds in a RT/NT system with a non- residual, broad-spectrum, foliar herbicide as a ‘burndown’ pre-seeding treatment followed by a post-emergent treatment when the crop became established, in what proved to be a more reliable and commercially attractive system than was previously possible. These technical and cost advantages have contributed to the rapid adoption of GM HT seed and RT/NT production systems. For example, there has been a 45% increase in the RT/NT soybean area in the US and a six-fold increase in Argentina since 1996. In 2018, RT/NT production accounted for 79% and 86% respectively of total soybean production in the US and Argentina, with 92% of the RT/NT soybean crop area in both countries using GM HT technology.
Substantial growth in RT/NT production sys- tems have also occurred in Canada, where the proportion of the total canola crop accounted for by RT/NT systems increased from 25% in 1996 to 50% by 2004, and in 2018, accounted for 75% of the total crop was planted to GM HT cultivars (96% the GM HT crop was RT/NT).
This shift away from a plow-based, to a RT/NT production system has resulted in a reduction in fuel use. The fuel savings used in this paper are drawn from a review of literature including the USDA’s Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP)33, CTIC5, USDA Energy Estimator34 and the USDA Comet-VR model.35 In this analysis, it is assumed that the adoption of NT farming systems in soybean production reduces cultivation and seedbed prepara- tion fuel usage by 27.12 liters/ha compared with tradi- tional conventional tillage and in the case of RT (mulch till) cultivation by 10.39 liters/ha. In the case of maize, NT results in a saving of 24.41 liters/ha and 7.52 liters/ha in the case of RT compared with con- ventional intensive tillage. These are conservative esti- mates and are in line with the USDA Energy Estimator for soybeans and maize.
The adoption of NT and RT systems in respect of fuel use therefore results in reductions of carbon dioxide emissions of 72.41 kg/ha and 27.74 kg/ha respectively for soybeans and 65.17 kg/ha and 20.08 kg/ha for maize.
Secondly, the use of RT/NT farming systems increases the amount of organic carbon in the

 form of crop residue that is stored or sequestered in the soil and therefore reduces carbon dioxide emissions to the environment.1,27,28,36–48
This literature shows that carbon sequestered levels vary by soil type, cropping system, eco- region and tillage depth and that tillage systems affect levels of other GHG emissions such as methane and nitrous oxide, as well as crop yield.
Overall, the literature highlights the difficulty in estimating the contribution NT/RT systems to soil carbon sequestration levels. If a specific crop area is in continuous NT crop rotation, the full soil carbon sequestration benefits described in the lit- erature can be realized. However, if the NT crop area is returned to a conventional tillage system, a proportion of the soil organic carbon gain will be lost. The temporary nature of this form of carbon storage only becomes permanent when farmers adopt a continuous NT system, which as indicated earlier, is highly dependent upon having an effec- tive herbicide-based weed control system.
Estimating long-term soil carbon sequestration is also complicated by the hypothesis typically used in soil carbon models that the level of soil organic carbon (SOC) reaches an equilibrium when the amount of carbon stored in the soil equals the amount of carbon released (the Carbon-Stock Equilibrium (CSE)). This implies that as equilibrium is reached, the rate of soil carbon sequestration may decline and therefore if equilibrium is being reached after many years of land being in NT with GM HT crops, the rate of carbon sequestration may be declining. The estimates pre- sented in this paper assume that a constant rate of carbon sequestration occurs because of the relatively short time period that NT/RT production systems have been operated (the time period that land may have been in ‘permanent non-cultivation is a maximum of 15–20 years). In addition, some researchers question whether the CSE assumption that is used in most soil models is valid because of the scope for very old soils to continue to store carbon.40
Drawing on the literature and models referred to above, the analysis presented in the following sub-sections assumes the following:
US: The soil carbon sequestered by tillage sys- tem for corn in continuous rotation with soybeans is assumed to be a net sink of 250 kg of carbon/ha/ year based on:
● NT systems store 251 kg of carbon/ha/year; ● RT systems store 75 kg of carbon/ha/year; ● CT systems store 1 kg of carbon/ha/year.
The soil carbon sequestered by tillage system for soybeans in a continuous rotation with corn is assumed to be a net sink of 100 kg of carbon/ha/ year based on:
● NT systems release 45 kg of carbon/ha/year; ● RT systems release 115 kg of carbon/ha/year; ● CT systems release 145 kg of carbon/ha/year.
Argentina and Brazil: soil carbon retention is 175 kg carbon/ha/year for NT soybean cropping and CT systems release 25 kg carbon/ha/year (a difference of 200 kg carbon/ha/year). In previous editions of this report the difference used was 300 kg carbon/ha/year.
Overall, the GHG emission savings derived from reductions in fuel use for crop spraying have been applied only to the area of GM IR crops worldwide (but excluding countries where conventional spraying has traditionally been by hand, such as in India and China) and the savings associated with reductions in fuel from less soil cultivation plus soil carbon storage have been lim- ited to NT/RT areas in North and South America that have utilized GM HT technology. Lastly, some RT/NT areas have also been excluded where the consensus view is that GM HT technology has not been the primary reason for use of these non plow-based systems (eg, parts of Brazil).
Additional detail relating to the estimates for carbon dioxide savings at the country and trait levels are presented in Appendix C.

          Note:
There are no Canadian-specific data available: analysis has therefore not been included for the Canadian crop of 740,000 ha planted to seed
containing GM IR traits targeted at rootworm pests
The maximum area treated for corn rootworm (on which the insecticide use change is based) is based on the historic area treated with insecticides
targeted at the corn rootworm. This is 30% of the total crop area. The 2018 maximum area on which this calculation is made has been reduced by 77,000 ha to reflect the increased use of soil-based insecticides (relative to usage in a baseline period of 2008–2010) that target the corn rootworm on the GM IR (targeting corn rootworm) area. It is assumed this increase in usage is in response to farmer concerns about the possible development of CRW resistance to the GM IR rootworm technology that has been reported in a small area in the US
GM IR cotton 2018.

            <Text>Crops that have been genetically engineered or genetically modified (GM) have been in commercial production for 24 years, since the planting of the first GM soybean crop in 1996. As of 2018, 26 countries grew 192 million hectares of GM crops, with the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India growing the vast majority of that area. In addition to these countries, 44 are importing GM crop products. In Argentina, 18 million hectares of GM soy, 5.5 million hectares of GM maize, and 0.37 million hectares of cotton were planted in 2018, at at adoption rate (relative to total crop area) of 99% for GM soy, 97% for GM maize, and 93% for GM cotton { | ISAAA, 2018 | | |zu:5334702:QDQ4ENZ7}. In the United States, GM corn accounted for 92%, GM soybeans 94%, and GM cotton 96% of the acreage  planted in 2020 https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/47649/alltables.xls?v=6605.8 ,https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption .
This level of adoption throughout the world has resulted in significant socio-economic, health and environmental benefits. In 2018, farm income worldwide from GM crops was US$18.95 billion, with a cumulative total income of US$ 225 billion, with half of that income earned by developing country farmers { | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:88XJI3UF}. The 2018 annual farm income is equivalent to the Gross Domestic Product of many African countries https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD . Since 1996, the use of insect resistant GM crops has resulted the reduction 775.4 million kg of pesticides { | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}, and as a result, decreased the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on these crops, as well as indirectly to farmers who did not use them { | Shelton, et al., 2002 | | |zu:5334702:TY7D7LQ6}{ | Cattaneo, et al., 2006 | | |zu:5334702:PBW77MMN}{ | Hutchison, et al., 2010 | | |zu:5334702:HF6GW8MN}{ | Kathage, &amp; Qaim, 2012 | | |zu:5334702:TVGQ2PTR}{ | Perry, et al., 2016 | | |zu:5334702:RDPMZSBN}{ | Dively, et al., 2018 | | |zu:5334702:8V4J94ZT}{ | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}. This reduction has direct benefits in terms of reducing farmer pesticide poisonings, as has been reported for China, India, Pakistan and South Africa (see Smyth { | -Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M}, and references therein). For insect resistant maize, human health benefits are also inferred by the reduction levels of mycotoxins, which are toxic—causing neural tube defects—and carcinogenic { | Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M}. These effects are particularly beneficial in those developing countries where maize is the staple food. Environmental benefits are also implied to be the result of reduction in pesticide use, through the known impacts of these pesticides on wildlife { | Brookes &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}{ | Siegrist &amp; Hartmann, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:WCDRBP8C}{ | Brookes, &amp; Dinh, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:SCEY3C2K}.</Text>

The Mala wi 2002 food crisis:
the rural development challeng
Andrew Dorward and Jonathan Kydd*
ABSTRACT
The recent food crisis in Malawi has drawn stark attention to the failures of
development policies over the last forty years to create wealth and develop a
robust economy or the markets on which such an economy must depend. Current
market liberalisation policies have achieved at best mixed success in addressing
the generic problems inhibiting smallholder agricultural development: low re-
turns to farmers' and service providers' investments, with high risks from natural
shocks, price variations, coordination failure and opportunistic behaviour. Post-
independence institutional mechanisms in Malawi were more successful in ad-
dressing some of these problems, in particular those of coordination risk, although
external and internal difficulties led to increasing costs and declining effectiveness
of these mechanisms, and to their collapse. They do provide, however, important lessons about the different failures of both market intervention and market lib-
eralisation policies. We suggest and discuss a set of critical elements needed for economic development and wealth creation in poor rural areas, and propose four basic principles to guide the search for, and design and implementation of, effective rural development strategies and policies.

Malawi is a very poor country:2 the national poverty rate was estimated at 65 % in 1998, and gross national income per capita in 2002 was esti- mated at $US 160, down from $US 200 in 1990. The economy is re- markably open: trade was 72 % of national income in 2oo2, compared to 57 % in 1990. There is a high dependence on foreign aid, at $US 38 per capita in 2ool, although aid flows have fallen significantly in very recent years as donors have been unable to fully disburse committed funds (World Bank 2003), because government has fallen out of compliance with mutually agreed strategies. The urbanisation rate is about 15 % and de- pendence on agriculture, estimated at 39 % of GDP in 2002, is notably high and little changed from an estimated 41% in 1982. It is thought that agriculture's share in national income has increased in the last five years or so, but this is less a consequence of agricultural growth than a result of continuing contraction in the industrial and service sectors, the latter probably being linked to declining aid disbursements. Presently, the in- vestment rate is pitiful: 9 % of GDP in 2002, compared with 23 % in 1990. There are a few bright spots in the last decade, with major improvements in primary school enrolment and its gender balance, and substantial falls in infant and under-five mortality (though these are still very high, with the under-five mortality rate falling from 253 to 183 per I,ooo live births be- tween 1985 and 2001).
We begin with an examination of generic problems facing poor rural areas in Malawi. Understanding these problems allows us to identify critical issues that need to be addressed. This provides us with an ana- lytical framework to consider ways in which first the post-independence policy regime and then a subsequent liberalisation policy regime have addressed, and then failed to address, these issues. We conclude by asking

Migrant labour opportunities had not only been available inter- nationally, but had developed rapidly in the domestic economy in the
1970os with the growth of tobacco estates (Kydd &amp; Christiansen 1982). Both international and domestic labour migration have been subject to differing
combinations of long-term declines and recent shocks, as a result of varied
processes which included: opening of previously protected domestic
industries to regional and international competition; declining commodity
prices; a switch from estate to smallholder burley tobacco production
(as discussed in note 2); failures in parastatals and in privatisation
processes; political instability; economic mismanagement; lack of inves-
tor confidence; and tightening of controls on international migration.
The result is declining opportunities for rural households to find jobs
elsewhere, and, for those households with members in employment,
reductions in job security, net incomes and ability to save and remit incomes.
A third major source of income in rural areas that is more difficult to
quantify is income from direct (i.e. non-agricultural) use of natural re-
sources (e.g. Cavendish I999 for Zimbabwe). While this undoubtedly re- mains important in the livelihoods of many rural people in Malawi, particularly in supporting coping strategies of poorer households (e.g. Fisher et al. 2002), it does not provide a basis for expanding incomes and welfare, it is threatened in many places by increasing population densities, and it faces important problems of crowding in and covariant risk with agricultural and agriculturally dependent activities.
One response by rural people to pressure on and declining oppor- tunities from agricultural, migrant and natural resources incomes has been to try to diversify into other activities (Bryceson 1999). A major difficulty in the context of the faltering of the traditional drivers of growth has been the lack of opportunities with low capital and skill demands and low risks, apart from petty trading, which has low barriers to entry but offers low returns (see e.g. Ellis et al. 2002).
Concentration of incomes from a narrow range of risky and low pro- ductivity activities is exacerbated by poor infrastructure, services and communications, with poor roads and transport services and poor tele- communications, leading to high costs in physical movement of goods and services in and out of rural areas, together with high costs of communi- cation about market opportunities and prices. Education and literacy, particularly among women, also tend to be low, and long-standing prob- lems of very poor health have been exacerbated by the spread of HIV/ AIDS.4 Health and education services, meanwhile, are stretched and often underresourced and ineffective, undermined themselves by the impact of

HIV/AIDS, limited human resources, fiscal constrai often ineffective management.
The result of the low general level of economic ac from lack of diversification, and of poor communica i.e. very low traded volumes of key commodities, manuf (examples of these categories being: agricultural p inputs and agricultural finance). Thin markets ar consequence of the fact that while volumes traded a risks of trading are high. Underlying factors include costs, the fact that these high costs are carried by v the combination of low and risk-prone volumes with formation services, leading to high risks of transact and sellers. This requires high risk premiums and m profitable to engage in markets, but these high margins demand, and the result is a low level equilibrium trap (Dorward et al. 2004). These problems are particu output and financial markets needed for the intens food crop production, notably for maize, the overw
staple food.
To examine how these problems might be overcome, we need to con-
sider in more detail the particular risks facing rural inhabitants and other investors or potential investors in these rural economies. We identify four basic categories of risk that inhibit productive investments necessary to promote economic growth and wealth creation in poor rural areas: risks of natural shocks; price risks; economic coordination risks; and risks of opportunism. We term the problem that these risks pose the 'systemic investment risks' of poor rural areas, as these areas face a particularly intractable set of development problems due to the high risks that investors face in all four risk categories.
Low levels of financial and physical capital, together with reliance on agriculture and natural resources, make poor rural economies and liveli- hoods particularly exposed and vulnerable to risks of natural shocks. These may arise from adverse weather (affecting crop yields or damaging physical assets); human, crop or animal disease; or physical insecurity (as a result of crime, political violence or conflict). Where markets are thin and there are poor communications and high transport costs, isolated markets are prone to large price risks when affected by local supply or demand shocks. This may be particularly problematic for food crops which have relatively inelastic demand, and where there are large differences between local import and export parity prices (as is the case for Malawi). There is a long-standing literature on the existence and effects of such risk for poor

rural livelihoods, and on ways that poor rural people attempt to reduce their exposure to it.
While we recognise the importance of these shocks, our primary focus here is to draw attention to two transaction risks that have not been given enough consideration by development policy analysts. These transaction risks may not be as obvious as the natural shocks and price risks discussed above, but they can nevertheless have devastating effects on the returns to investments, and hence on investment flows. First we consider economic coordination risk, which is the risk of failure of one player's investment due to the possible absence of complementary investments by other players in different stages in the supply chain. In developed economies these risks have been examined in a seminal work by Williamson (1985) and in sub- sequent new institutional economics writings on transaction costs and contractual arrangements. There has been less work on this problem in developing economies (Jaffee &amp; Morton 1995; Dorward et al. 1998).
It is not generally recognised that the problems of specific assets as defined by Williamson are a special case of a more general problem of thin markets which, as argued above, are a systemic problem in poor rural areas. When the returns to an investment are dependent upon comp- lementary actions in a very thin market, any investment is subject to the risk that either no other actor will make the necessary complementary actions (economic coordination risk), or that an actor who could make such actions has an effective monopoly and is able to capture an undue share of the revenue in the supply chain. The latter is an example of the second type of transaction risk that we need to consider, risk of opportunism by other players. Risks of opportunism not only arise where there are thin markets, but may also occur where there are weak institutions protecting contracting parties from opportunism, or where there is strong infor- mation asymmetry (for example where the quality of goods or services is difficult for buyers to judge). However, thin markets lead to important additional risks of opportunism.
Economic coordination risks, and associated risks of opportunism, are particularly problematic in poor rural areas, with their very low levels of economic activity, poor transport and thin markets. In the development of markets needed to support more intensive crop production in poor rural areas, for example, there are extensive economic coordination risks facing different investors required in the supply chain: financial service pro- viders, input suppliers, farmers, produce traders and transporters. Thus returns to farmers' borrowings to purchase inputs are dependent on ac- cess to inputs (subsequent to borrowing), and on access to produce markets (subsequent to production); returns to financial service providers'

The former refers to the means attempt to overcome the challenges of transacting in a some aspects of which have been sketched above in Malawi. The latter refers to the broader features of the

Malawi's post-independence history provides examples of the interplay of these issues. For thirt I960s to the early 199os, Malawi pursued a broadly building institutional arrangements and coordinat rural development, subsequently abandoning this ventionist approach. While power and ideology are this story, we focus on more pragmatic processes led to the development of institutional arrangem mechanisms within the broad ideologies and struct in Malawi at different times during this period.

6. business opportunities that offer significant e vestors; it has been argued elsewhere (Kydd et al generally offers the best prospects for stimulating reducing growth in rural areas in Africa, eithe

policies in the late I98os. How can this agenda cessfully at the start of the twenty-first century?
WHERE NEXT?PRINCIPLES,POLICIES AND ACTION
There are no simple off-the-peg answers, but four principles should guid the search for and design and implementation of effective rural develop ment strategies:
* The fiscal costs of rural development must be set against the human, economic an financial costs of development failure, either continuing poverty and sporadi relief (with unacceptable human costs that were particularly apparent in the recent crisis but are also evident in high chronic prevalence o
child malnutrition and infant mortality), or indefinite safety nets.
* Institutional innovation is needed to develop more imaginative solutions that re duce risk and promote coordination, sustainable investment, confidence and marke
development, addressing the twin problems of state and market failur that have each bedevilled in different ways both the market inter- vention and the market liberalisation approaches to development These are very difficult problems, and we discuss below some ideas as

to how they might be addressed. The insights from new institutional economics applied to institutional arrangements and economic co- ordination may be helpful here, in identifying the precise features in arrangements that cause them either to succeed or to fail.
* Policies and interventions should be designed to beflexible and to address and match the varied and changing opportunities and constraints of different areas, with dif- ferent balances of emphasis between wealth creation and safety nets, and between different opportunities and different institutional mech- anisms in different areas. This will involve a phased approach that seizes opportunities as they arise and is prepared to move forward fast in areas where the way forward is clearer, while acting more cautiously where problems are more intractable. Varying emphasis will also be needed on different types of technical change, and different technolo- gies will need different types of phased institutional development (see e.g. Kydd et al. 2001).
* Policies and interventions should also be mutually consistent and long term, so that different players have time to learn how to operate in a stable economic and institutional environment, so that they have confidence that in- vestments will yield returns in the short, medium and long term, and so that policies and interventions in different sectors and different areas do not work against each other. A particularly important issue here is that short and medium-term interventions focusing on relief and poverty alleviation should support rather than undermine longer-term policies and processes of market and wealth creation.
These principles perhaps raise more questions than they answer, with, for example, critical questions about the types of institutional innovations that could meet these challenges; about apparently intractable problems in areas where there are no apparent business opportunities to support widespread growth; and about contradictory demands for flexible policies on the one hand and stability and consistency on the other, while charting new waters in a rapidly changing world with political expediency and competition for limited resources in dealing with short-term crises. We briefly address each of these issues in turn.
As noted earlier, weaknesses in the institutional environment are
increasingly prominent in discussions of development policy. Vitally
important though these matters are, our earlier analysis shows that
overcoming weaknesses in the institutional environment will not be
enough to get markets going where there are severe problems of economic coordination risk: non-market coordination mechanisms are needed to
'kick-start' markets and economic activity (Dorward et al. 2004). The state,

portant in helping to reduce some elements of invest
investor confidence. However, they do not deal centr
issues of coordination, opportunism, and price risks, investment.
Lines of solution may be found in building on the pockets of past success with parastatals and of current success with cash crops; measures that may be able to simultaneously address coordination and opportunism risks in- clude regulated monopolies, regional commodity franchises, trader associ- ations and farmer associations. These may be integrated with measures that provide some form of insurance for investors and consumers against price risk. State approaches include the maintenance of grain reserves, price intervention and guarantees, and market information systems. Non- state approaches include improvements to market infrastructure and the development of commodity exchanges and insurance markets. All of these have well-known and difficult problems related to moral hazard, adverse
selection and governance; and proposals for input, maize or price sub- sidies have very large budgetary implications. However, there is a growing body of expertise on different ways of managing risk (e.g. Anderson 2001) and combinations of international, national and local institutions can often be crafted to reduce these problems (for example, benefits from long- term mutual commitments to different forms of' competitive cooperation' or interlocking arrangements may provide both incentives for comp- lementary investments and protection from opportunistic behaviour, Dorward et al. 1998). These problems can only be overcome if govern- ments and the international community recognise and commit resources to address these issues in partnership with rural people, businesses, NGOs and civil society.
A second major difficulty is the apparently intractable problem in many high population areas in identifying profitable activities which could support widespread poverty reducing growth. In overcrowded areas in southern Malawi, for example, there are few if any agricultural ac- tivities that can provide widespread and sustained improved income opportunities. These areas were largely bypassed by the growth in maize production supported by the 'post-independence institutional fix' (although Evans &amp; Kydd 1990 document some success in the I98os). Important though these problems are, they should not hold back action

that will either support growth in other areas or support limited growth in these areas, as some growth is better than none, with benefits for poorer areas in (a) stimulating growth in the economy as a whole (with positive spin- offs as regards increased demand for labour, growth in the non-farm econ- omy, and government revenues), and (b) generating experience and ideas to take forward in the more difficult areas. There is an important related question here regarding the extent to which attention should be focused on maize production and markets in its supply chain. Post-independence policies placed a strong emphasis on maize, due to the heavy reliance on and preference for maize in rural and urban diets. However, in tending to ignore root crops and millet, these policies increased reliance on maize (which is a relatively risky crop in some areas), and failed to develop technologies and marketing and information systems for other often locally important crops.
A third difficulty with the four principles we propose is the apparent contradictory demands for flexible policies on the one hand and stability and consistency on the other. How can stability be achieved in countries experimenting with policies, responding to crises rather than manag- ing change, and vulnerable to highly uncertain natural, economic and donor policy environments? Is stability compatible with radical structural changes such as land redistribution? There are no simple answers to this, but again, a first step is to recognise the problem, and then to identify key elements for managing change. These are likely to include emphasis on transparency and on deliberative mechanisms that establish goals and rules for responding to and managing change, with checks and balances that restrain and penalise opportunistic behaviour by governments and donors (and their agents) as well as other stakeholders. Such mechanisms inevitably imply some mutual voluntary surrender of sovereignty. 'Joined up' policy formulation processes are also needed to ensure consistency across different areas, across different sectors, and across different types of policy (for example relief and development policies, as indicated earlier).
There are also important questions for regional coordination here. Devereux (2oo2) notes that price supports and subsidies may be more problematic now than in the past, as border effects were more limited when more countries were following similar pricing policies. Better re- gional market and policy integration might also play an important role in reducing price risks.
The recent food crisis in Malawi and elsewhere in central-southern Africa
has drawn stark attention to the failures of development policies over the

This will require long-term investment in institution building, a willingness to radically rethink current market liberalisation policies and consider costly interventions to make farming profitable, and a willingness by all stakeholders (and particularly governments and donors) to commit them- selves to pragmatic partnerships that by developing trust allow them to surrender some of their sovereignty and take risks, in the hope of achieving wider gains.

5. The terms 'low level equilibrium trap' and 'underdevelopment equilibrium' are virtually inter- changeable. Hoff (2000) gives an account of the origins of the concept, starting with Rodenstein-Rodan in 1943 and developed in the works of Nurkse, Myrdal and Hirschman. The essence of the idea is that the widespread existence of spillovers/externalities and the need for certain critical public goods means that, at the early stages of development, sustained economic growth will be very difficult to achieve without government intervention to fund public goods and undertake the necessary coordi- nation to push the economy out of the trap. Modern formulations of low level equilibrium traps stress that they can persist and prove intractable in the face of positive individual changes such as: improved export prices, technological 'silver bullets' and 'good mutations' of current institutional arrangements.
6. In addition to these very practical problems facing private sector led agricultural development, wider political motives were very important for the development of parastatals. There was often a deep mistrust of private companies seen to be dominated by or associated with former colonial interests, and often a socialist philosophy suspicious of the private sector and of markets, with a belief in the need for the state to actively intervene to direct the economy to achieve both productive and welfare objectives. At the same time there was great confidence in the ability of the state; and economic development theories that stressed the importance of industrial sector development, and the taxation of agriculture to finance this, found state involvement in agricultural marketing activities a convenient tool for such taxation. In Malawi in particular the parastatal system was linked to the development of the autocratic one party state.
7. This success in credit was partly due to the prevailing institutional environment (i.e. the 'hard state' of President Banda) with confiscation of property of defaulters. While this was important in encouraging repayment for households facing particular crises or otherwise tempted to default for short-term gain, we hold that other aspects of the institutional arrangements themselves strongly discouraged farmers with longer-term horizons from defecting on credit contracts. These institutional arrangements included mutually guaranteeing credit groups subject to the sanction of the closure of poorly performing groups. The incentive to be a member of a group with a good credit record was not only access to finance, but also access to assistance by extension workers with the logistics of produce marketing and, more importantly, often rationed input supply.
8. By contrast the burden of subsidies, loan defaults and price controls in Zimbabwe and Zambia led to unsustainable drains on government fiscal resources, and, with increasing cash flow problems, inability to deliver effective services.
9. In Zimbabwe, for example, Natural Regions IV and V were largely excluded from the benefits of the maize revolution (Poulton et al. 2002). In Malawi the Central and Northern Regions, where land pressure and poverty rates are lower, gained more from these policies than the Southern Region, where land pressure and poverty are higher.

abstract
While the Green Revolution has been successful in some regions like South and East Asia, it could hardly address any achievement in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This paper tries to draw a picture on lessons learned from the failures of this revolution that should be taken into account before implementing the so-called Gene Revolution in the SSA region. After scrutinizing the failures and the pros and cons of GM crops in the region, the paper introduces some potentials for improving the malnutrition situation in SSA through launching a successful GM technology. However, it remains doubtful whether this technology can improve the situation of small-scale farmers as long as they receive no financial support from their national governments. Therefore, before any intervention, the socio-economic and environmental impacts of GM technology need to be carefully addressed in the framework of a series of risk assessment studies. Besides, some sort of multi- stakeholder dialog (from small-scale farmers to consumers) involving public–private sector and non- governmental organizations should be heated up at both national and regional levels with regard to the myths and truths of this technology.

 1. Introduction
This paper discusses the consequences of genetic modified (GM) crops in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared with the Green Revolution. It is a critical issue because while the Green Revolution brought much success in some regions like South and East Asia, it could never work out in the SSA region (Mugabe, 2003). At the moment, this is an important topic due to the fact that still millions of hungers live in this region and deal with poverty. According to the FAO (2009), in 2005, 213.8 millions of poor were identified as undernourished in SSA. Moreover, more than

600 million people live on small farms measuring no more than a few hectares each in this region where low productivity due to biotic and abiotic factors is responsible for food insufficiency and malnutrition (Olembo, 2005; 173). It seems that without a new revolution in the agricultural sector, their living standards might be worsened. A couple of important questions could be asked here: why did not the Green Revolution work out in SSA? And what can be learned from this revolution to launch a successful and new revolution called ‘Gene Revolution’ in this region?
More precisely, the paper tries to answer to the following questions: Why was not the Green Revolution successful in SSA? Can the Gene Revolution result in an improvement on the malnutrition in the region? What can be learned from the failure of the Green Revolution in SSA to
 
benefit from a successful GM technology approach? What are the main advantages of GM crops compared with non-GM's in SSA? What threats are involved when implementing GM technology in the region?
2. Green Revolution
2.1. Successor
In 1798, Thomas Malthus published his first Essay on the Principle of Population. He believed “the populations of the world would increase in geometric proportions while the food resources available would increase only in arithmetic proportions”. Malthus rejected that technological progress might deal with the growing population (Weeks, 2005). When the industrial revolution emerged, the food production passed the population growth. However, despite the increased food production since 150 years ago, there are still enormous undernourishment problems. The problems prompted the Rockefeller Foundation, in the 1940s, to gather and fund a team of specialists in order to develop agricultural innovations for developing countries (Wu and Butz, 2004). The team developed some new seeds which were superior to other indigenous species in terms of increasing the yield, yield stability, resistant to diseases and insects and grain quality. Along the seeds, they also introduced a package of other innovations including new fertilizers, irrigation systems, and pesticides (Perkins, 1990). According to Wu and Butz (2004), a new version of Green Revolution is now emerging as so-called ‘Gene Revolution’. The supporters of the Gene Revolution argue that this revolution can create resistant plants to certain diseases and water shortages, and even capable to improve soil texture. On the contrary, the opponents believe the new revolution may bring unexpected and irreversible effects to human health and environment (Knox and Marston, 2007).
2.2. Success and failure
During the Green Revolution, the improved high yield varieties (HYVs) resulted in a tremendous increase in food production worldwide. They accounted for almost 90 and 70% of the increased world's foods, respectively at the end of the 1960s and 1970s (Knox and Marston, 2007). The Green Revolution was especially an obvious success in Asia and Latin America where the regions could almost eliminate the undernourishment. However, the revolution did not have the desired results everywhere. It did not have its intended effects in SSA and even at the moment, the results in most of the African countries are limited. While the new technologies were performing well in laboratories, they were not successful in the field. The researchers ignored the local conditions of these countries (Wu and Butz, 2004). The scientists had also not taken into account the fact that many of the existing crops have several secondary uses like fuel, provision of hay, building materials and fodder. The new developed crops did not provide the farmers such secondary functions, which discouraged them from employing the new technologies (Smirzai, 2005). Instead, the revolution has led to a monoculture by cultivating a minimum variety of some cereals like maize, wheat, and rice (Thompson, 2007).
Also, the low population density in the SSA region hampered the application of new seeds, fertilizers and pesticides in order to intensify agriculture (Smirzai, 2005). When rapid population growth occurred in those countries which have low population density, the farmers continued using extensive methods of agriculture because there was still uncultivated land available. They were not forced by land scarcity to apply new techniques and therefore the farmers did not make the transition to intensification of agriculture. On the one hand, the rapid population growth, and on the other, extensive agricultural practices (Smirzai, 2005) resulted in a futile circle as the practices could result in agricultural land conversion (Azadi et al., 2010) and lower agricultural output.
The application of fertilizers was another important factor in order to let the new varieties become more productive (Otsuka and Kalirajan,
2006). However, because of the high fertilizer costs and low output prices, the Sub-Saharan African peasants were discouraged from using the fertilizers. As a result, the soil fertility tended to deplete and the outputs seemed to decrease. Otsuka and Kalirajan (2006) argue that the high fertilizers' costs weakened the peasants' bargaining power at market level. Furthermore, the prices increased because of the transportation system in SSA that was not well developed. Wu and Butz (2004) discuss, because of undeveloped transportation systems, it was difficult to put modern technologies timely in places where needed. Besides fertilizers, chemical pesticides were also required. Obviously, over time, pesticides and fertilizers could cause soil degradation and water pollution. In sum, the following reasons can be considered for the failures of the Green Revolution in SSA:
▪ While implementing new agricultural techniques, the hidden functions of conventional crops were neglected by researchers;
▪ Low population density and abundance of uncultivated land did
not force farmers to apply new techniques. Such drivers let farmers
continue their extensive agricultural practices.
▪ The high fertilizers' costs and low output prices concerned
peasants about implementing the new techniques;
▪ An undeveloped transportation system hampered a fair distribu-
tion of the modern technologies among the farmers;
▪ The risk to human health and environmental pollution due to the use of fertilizers and pesticides, discouraged the farmers from
going for the new varieties.
3. Toward the Gene Revolution: lessons learned from the Green Revolution
There are a lot of similarities between the two revolutions. The Green Revolution increased food production that was very vital for developing countries because of their serious food deficiency. At the moment, the Gene Revolution has the potential to increase food production as well (Wu and Butz, 2004). The technology of both the revolutions focuses on plant attributes and they both concentrate on the global markets and capture subsistence farming. Because of such similarities, the following issues should carefully be addressed in the framework of a series of risk assessment case studies before welcoming the GM technology.
First, the costs and charges of GM technology should be addressed. At the moment, such technologies are being supported by major oligopoly capitalist firms like Monsanto, Pioneer Hybrid, Syngenta, and Dupont which are playing the important role of disseminating GM seeds throughout the world. GM products may be licensed by the patent holders and therefore, those farmers who grow GM crops might become dependent on buying their seeds from those, relatively few suppliers (Morse, 2008) while the seeds have to be bought every year because farmers cannot reproduce them by themselves. Furthermore, according to (McMichael, 2009a: 252), at a time when flexible seed selection by African farmers has managed recurring drought, gene patents threaten farmer sovereignty, and shift resources away from farmer-based strategies for climate change survival and adaptation.
At present, many SSA farmers are unable to compete with the relatively lower prices that many especially North American food producers are able to sell rice, wheat, corn and soybeans for and the consequence has been a ruination of many SSA farmers who wind up flooding the major cities of Africa. More importantly, “small-scale farmers” cannot easily afford such new expensive seeds each year. Just like the HYVs, GM seeds are a large expenditure for such farmers in SSA (Wu and Butz, 2004).
There are also concerns about possible dumping (i.e. setting the pricing of a product below its cost of production) of GM crops by the firms or nations in an effort to dispose of surplus stocks or to recoup money spent on costly transgenic research and development (Azadi et al., 2011). In 2003, for instance, the United States had 65 million tons of surplus non-GM wheat and rice in its Food Cooperation stocks.

910 S. Bazuin et al. / Biotechnology Advances 29 (2011) 908–912
Paradoxically, just a year before, the US sent India a large shipment of food aid with genetically modified ingredients, which India rejected (Friends of the Earth International, 2003). The US has also dumped subsidized rice in Haiti, forcing thousands of poor rice farmers off the land (Kamau, 2002). Dumping food on to poorer nations (i.e. free, subsidized, or cheap food, below market prices) undercuts local farmers, who cannot compete and are driven out of jobs and into poverty, further slanting the market share of the larger producers such as those from the US and Europe (Shah, 2005).
Accordingly, the States has been accused of dumping some GM crops, especially into francophone parts of Africa, in part because Europe does not accept it. This might even undercut local producers accelerating the rural to urban shift. The concern has also been that single seed companies may gain a monopoly over the seed supply market. If this happens, prices could be increased all the way up to the consumer because of increased seed prices.
Also, the risk of widening the gap between large and small-scale farmers should be addressed. Rich farmers might be able to adopt GM crops earlier and faster than the poor farmers (Smirzai, 2005). Accordingly, if GM crops become available in SSA, they will be more available to wealthier farmers who can afford such technological innovations (Azadi et al., 2011). Therefore, a first lesson learned might be to give the poor farmers easier access to credits (e.g.) by subsidies and low interest loans. However, others allege a biotechnological bias toward larger farms, because the society can have some earlier benefits through them (Azadi and Ho, 2010). As a result, it may solve the problem of per capita food insecurity in SSA countries.
Second, the dissemination of biotechnology knowledge among the SSA region remains poor. Even though the undeveloped infrastructure (roads, communication systems) hamper the spreading of biotech- nological knowledge, GM producers should strive for spreading GM crops throughout the whole SSA region, instead of limiting the access to biotechnologies to a small number of (large-scale) farmers. For instance, in Asia, the first Green Revolution varieties became regional public goods, in the sense that varieties were diffused in the country where they were being developed, as well as in neighboring regions (Otsuka and Kalirajan, 2006). If there is no openness in the production methods of GM crops in different sub-regions of SSA, chances to generate the Gene “Revolution” are not high. Hence, a more favorable environment for implementing GM technology in SSA may arise when the relatively few suppliers of GM seeds, agricultural research centers, large, and small-scale farmers establish longstanding relationships in order to exchange knowledge about a feasible implementation of GM crops. However, as long as the knowledge of biotechnology is privatized by the use of patent rights and a monopoly of a few GM seed suppliers, such a favorable environment cannot be created.
Third, the investments in infrastructures (e.g. transport systems, communication systems) have to be made to attain more access to markets and to create an encouraging environment to disseminate the biotechnology knowledge among participating stakeholders. Without necessary improvements in infrastructures, the Gene Revolution may experience the same failures as its predecessor.
Carruthers et al. (2010) discuss when infrastructure is absent or degraded, it no longer fulfills its connective functions, and the economy suffers. Although investments in infrastructure have currently contributed more than half to Africa's improved economic growth, still much more needs to be made (Prasad, 2011). According to IFC (2010), in recent years, investments in the SSA's infrastructures have averaged about $10 billion per year, equivalent to just three percent of the region's gross domestic product and only approxi- mately half of what is needed to support sustained economic growth.
The African leaders of the New Partnership for Africa's Develop- ment (NEPAD) have clearly indicated that among their priorities are infrastructure and agriculture; the two have an interface. To launch a widespread agricultural development program (like the Gene Revolution), NEPAD discusses the necessity of major transport
corridors for product processing and marketing (FAO, 2002), especially, if products are expected to be presented beyond local markets (Azadi et al., 2011). As a response to this problem, national governments together with international donors could primarily focus on improving existing major corridors and constructing roads between farms and markets to increase the linkage between producers and consumers (MIT, 2011).
Fourth and final is that despite an increase in food production, there are a lot of political, socio-economic and bio-physical interplays that should also be considered. For example, McMichael (2009a,b) draws a historical picture on geo-political drivers in the framework of global ecology and a “food regime analysis”. He presents a macro analysis to explain the strategic role of major previous agricultural programs (like the Green Revolution) in the construction of the world capitalist economy (McMichael, 2009b). He further discusses (McMi- chael, 2009a) that the global development project faces newly evident challenges in the combination of energy, climate and food crises which are realized more critical in SSA and can affect major new food policies (like the Gene Revolution) in favor of capitalist economy resulting more in marginalizing poor farmers (Saini, 1976; Wu and Butz, 2004), and biodiversity loss (Goodland, 1997; Trewavas, 2001). As a result, if such incidental circumstances are not taken into account, it will be difficult to launch a successful Gene Revolution.
4. Application of GM crops in Sub-Saharan Africa
4.1. Potential gains
There are some potential gains when implementing GM crops in SSA. First and most importantly, those farmers who use GM crops might gain higher yields that could provide the basis to lessen the undernourished (Smirzai, 2005). At the moment, SSA is dependent on wheat and rice imports to acquire sufficient food for its population. Between 1995 and 2001, rice consumption increased by 5.3%, while the production rate grew by 2% (FAO, 2008). To meet the high demands, the rice imports increased annually by 8.4% so that SSA now accounts for 20% of the total world rice imports. If GM rice is implemented more extensively throughout SSA, this rice can be adapted to the specific environmental circumstances in the region, and as a result, dependency on imports can decrease. However, policy makers need to bear in mind the importance of food distribution. This view has been theorized by Drèze and Sen's (1990) entitled approach in which they elucidate that starvation is not necessarily caused by an overall shortage of food. Not everybody has the same capacities, capabilities, and connections to get access to food. Hence, if yields increase due to the application of GM seeds, it does not necessarily mean that undernourishment will decrease. It is also important to understand how the farmers sell and distribute their products.
Second, with regard to plant improvement, according to Morse (2008), GM crops are more targeted than conventional crops. For GM crop breeding, it is not necessary to handle millions of genes but only a few (Morse, 2008). Some other potential gains of the implementation of GM crops in SSA are presented by Thomson's (2007) study on some practical examples of the implementation of insect resistant maize varieties, drought tolerant, and virus resistant crops. The advantages presented include maize genes that can be modified to specific situations, as in this case, they were modified to become more resistant to viruses, insects, and also to the African dry weather. Furthermore, the small-scale farmers in SSA can use such insect resistant varieties to protect their crops against fungal infections which are originated mostly from the moist and warm storages of the crops in this region.
Third is the possibility to provide a tolerance to herbicides. This means that a farmer can spread herbicide on his/her field in order to eliminate undesirable plants except those which carry the tolerant gene (Wu and Butz, 2004). For consumers, GM crops can have some

indirect advantages too. When farmers adopt GM crops, the costs of cultivating such crops might decrease due to less chemical inputs, because of the pest resistance of some GM crops with transgenic pesticides (Azadi and Ho, 2010). As a result, food prices could decrease, so the possibilities for the SSA's poor people to be fed may increase. Furthermore, there are some developments with crop enrichment by adjusting nutritional elements. Perhaps, the most famous enrichment is used for ‘golden rice’. The rice contains some extra vitamin A which can protect people from blindness (Anderson and Jackson, 2005). As, according to Mason et al. (2001), 30 to 40% of preschool children in SSA suffer from vitamin A deficiency (VAD), the attachment of specific nutrients by GM technologies might partly be beneficiary to solve the deficiency of micronutrients in this region.
4.2. Potential losses
Critics argue that there are several limitations when using GM crops in SSA. First, opponents fear that GM crops can cause a loss in the genetic diversity of SSA, because the farmers will rely on producing a fixed set of GM crops. Consequently, without genetic diversity, the risk of epidemics will increase (Smirzai, 2005). Moreover, a loss in genetic diversity can exacerbate soil degradation that tends to be more deteriorated due to the loss of micro-organisms which naturally replenish the soil nutrients. Van Straaten (2002) argues that the African soil productivity has steadily declined in the last two decades due to the high depletion rate of the soil. Without maintaining a fertile soil, the success rate for the Sub-Saharan African farmers to produce sufficient and safe food will not be high. However, there are some signs that GM crops could potentially be a way of enriching soil texture since crops engineered are prospered not only to face drought, disease, and pests, but also to offer greater biomass post harvest. Due to the huge fertility issues affecting so much of Africa's latosol soils, more immediate advantage may accrue to SSA by simply breaking up and spreading the crushed remains of rocks that are badly needed minerals contained in those rocks like phosphorus.
Second, critics fear a potential risk for gene transfer from one GM to other non-GM crops. According to Altieri (2005), it is self-evident that modified genes can move beyond the intended destinations and easily contaminate other proximate non-GM crops. This cross-pollination/ contamination may cause serious problems for the non-GM crop growers since GM traits in cash crops, specifically for export markets in Europe are unacceptable (Anderson and Jackson, 2005). The EU is not allowing GM crops for human use, because according to the union, it may endanger human health. The EU's politicians want to make sure that they import totally GM free products. This means that if Sub- Saharan African countries need to open a market in the EU, they may not deal with GM crops. However, Anderson and Jackson (2005), after executing the scenario simulation model GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project), suppose that SSA gains more welfare by allowing GM production in their countries instead of banning such products in order to attain a greater access to the EU market. Also Paarlberg (2006) argues that the risks of commercial export for Africa are realistic but low. After analyzing the data of more than 12 African countries, he claims that the contribution of GM products to the total farm exports is not significant while only a small share of these GM products may go to sensitive GM markets such as the EU's.
Third, also related to the risk of cross-contamination, is the possibility of evolving ‘super weeds’. Transgenes might escape from GM crops to wild species and create the so-called super weeds, which are resistant to herbicides (Morse, 2008). It might result in useless implementation of costly herbicides which are often too expensive for the poor farmers in SSA.
Fourth, the last important constraint is that GM technology might not reach the poor farmers due to the property and rights of the technologies (Azadi and Ho, 2010). In line with this constraint, Amalu (2003) has also stated that profits of new advanced crops will
probably benefit large rather than small-scale farmers who have usually less access to financial resources and awareness toward technological advances. The adoption and adaption of GM technology by the Sub-Saharan African farmers might also be constrained by high illiteracy rates that result in difficulties to disperse knowledge and awareness among the farmers to employ the technology.
5. Discussion and conclusion
Although the global food crisis during 2007–2008 was sunk into oblivion by the emergence of the financial and economic crisis, the need for feeding the ever increasing population can never be ignored. Whereas SSA includes a large part of the growing world population, the access and availability to sufficient nourishment still remains very scarce in the region. While GM crops have been introduced in South Africa, Malawi and a few other southern SSA countries, their introduction has been sporadic and they might be no panacea for solving food insecurity. To better understand the possible gains and losses of GM crops in SSA, it is imperative to take into account the failures of the Green Revolution in the SSA region. After scrutinizing the failures and also the pros and cons of GM crops in this region, this paper considers some potentials for improving the malnutrition situation in SSA through launching a successful Gene Revolution.
Drought tolerant GM crops could be beneficiary for this region where chronic and acute droughts often occur. The big GM crop companies (Monsanto and Pioneer Hybrid, Syngenta, and DuPont) have already developed crops with drought tolerance traits. Accord- ingly, the Sub-Sahara African farmers can therefore rest assured of a safe-net harvest when facing drought (Paarlberg, 2006). However, without financial support from the African states, the small-scale farmers will not be able to afford such an expensive technology. For example, in Ethiopia more than 90% of the agricultural outputs are produced by subsistence farmers (Azadi et al., 2011). If they cannot get access to the aforementioned drought tolerant crops, the implementation of GM crops will not have a significant impact on the region. Furthermore, biotechnology allows also for breeding the varieties which are enriched by micronutrients such as vitamin A, zinc, and iron. Crops enriched with micronutrients can be provided to the malnourished people in SSA who often have to deal with an unbalanced diet (von Braun, 2010). In addition, GM crops have a lower demand for herbicides and pesticides which can result in less cost for the farmers and positive environmental impacts.
In conclusion, despite the potential advantages of GM technology in SSA, it remains doubtful whether it can positively affect the situation of small-scale farmers as long as they receive no financial support from their national governments. Moreover, the local socio-economic and environ- mental impacts of GM crops need to be considered. When GM crops contaminate non-GM's, conventional breeders face the risk of diminish- ing exports. Hence, the effects of implementing GM technologies in SSA on their export markets should critically be assessed before launching any Gene Revolution as a solution for malnutrition in SSA. Also the environmental impacts should carefully be addressed. In order to be fully aware of the positive and negative impacts of GM technology in SSA, von Braun (2010) recommends an increase of investments in R&amp;D and a strengthening of partnerships to exchange biotechnology knowledge between organizations at different scales (global, national, regional, and local).
In addition, it should be noted that given some important contextual differences, existing GM researches will not necessarily be transportable to SSA. The main contextual differences include possible dissimilarities in the roots of food insecurity and malnutrition in the region, the nature of health concerns, the prominence of agriculture, and diverse food regulation systems (Mugabe, 2003; Pelletier, 2005). This may imply that the potential benefits as well as the potential risks of biotechnological innovation may have dispro- portionate impacts in the SSA context that should explicitly be

addressed. For instance, corn and soybeans that are glyphosate resistant in North American must locally be tested through many parts of SSA before their seeds are sold directly to farmers. Such adaptability researches must study the biosafety and environmental risk assessment concerns that have been raised around the world in response to GM crops before these crops can safely be promoted. Overall, all the impacts of using this technology should carefully be assessed in the framework of a series of risk assessment studies on the bases of both “crop-case” and “region-case”.
The risk assessment studies should address the possible trade-offs; most importantly, biosafety regulatory frameworks, the role of multi- national companies and other stakeholders in the application of biotechnology with respect to biosafety issues (Ushewokunze-Obatolu, 2005), regulatory policies that warrant the right of poor farmers and consumers (Pelletier, 2005), the role of intellectual property right (Olembo, 2005), and the gains and losses of stakeholders (Matz and Ferenz, 2005).
Lastly, some sort of multi-stakeholder dialog involving public– private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should be heated up at both national and regional levels. Some people within Africa especially believe that implementing GM technology goes against nature and God. Others claim huge productivity benefits with minimal negative environmental consequences of implementing this technology. Hence, the academic disputes on the potential of GM technology need to be widened to a broader public debate in which all stakeholders (from small-scale farmers to consumers) can get informed about all the myths and truths of this technology.

Abstract
CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease-based gene drives rely on inducing chromosomal breaks in the germline that are repaired in ways that lead to a biased inheritance of the drive. Gene drives designed to impair female fertility can suppress populations of the mosquito vector of malaria. However, strong unintended fitness costs, due to ectopic nuclease expression, and high levels of resistant mutations, limited the potential of the first generation of gene drives to spread.
Here we show that changes to regulatory sequences in the drive element, designed to contain nuclease expression to the germline, confer improved fecundity over previous versions and generate drastically lower rates of target site resistance. We employed a genetic screen to show that this effect is explained by reduced rates of end-joining repair of DNA breaks at the target site caused by deposited nuclease in the embryo.
Highlighting the impact of deposited Cas9, many of the mutations arising from this source of nuclease activity in the embryo are heritable, thereby having the potential to generate resistant target sites that reduce the penetrance of the gene drive.
Finally, in cage invasion experiments these gene drives show improved invasion dynamics compared to first generation drives, resulting in greater than 90% suppression of the reproductive output and a delay in the emergence of target site resistance, even at a resistance-prone target sequence. We shed light on the dynamics of generation and selection of resistant alleles in a population by tracking, longitudinally, the frequency of resistant alleles in the face of an invading gene drive. Our results illustrate important considerations for future gene drive design and should expedite the development of gene drives robust to resistance.
Introduction
Gene drives and malaria control
Gene drives are genetic elements that are capable of biasing their own inheritance, allowing their autonomous spread in a population, even from a very low initial frequency. Coupling a trait of interest to a drive element is a way of deliberately modifying a population, potentially in a very short timeframe. In the case of the mosquito vector of malaria, gene drives have been proposed to spread traits that either interfere with the mosquito’s capacity to reproduce, or its capacity to transmit the malaria parasite.
We know that vector control is effective in controlling malaria – the malaria burden was halved in the period 2000-2015 and the vast majority of this gain was achieved through targeting the vector with conventional insecticide-based approaches (bednets and residual spraying) [1]. However, resistance to insecticides is stalling these gains [2]. Gene drive is a technology with the potential to augment and complement existing control approaches in a self-sustaining way.

Endonuclease-based homing gene drives
Gene drives based on site-specific endonucleases were first proposed over 15 years ago [3] and recent advances in CRISPR technology have led to several demonstrations that this endonuclease, which is easy to reprogram to recognise a genomic site of choice, can be repurposed as a gene drive [4, 5].
The premise is that the endonuclease is sufficiently specific to recognise a DNA target sequence within a region of interest and the gene encoding the endonuclease is inserted within this target sequence on the chromosome, thereby rendering it immune to further cleavage. When a chromosome containing the endonuclease is paired with a chromosome containing the wild type target site, the site is cleaved to create a double stranded break (DSB) that can be repaired, either through simple ‘cut and shut’ non- homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or through homology-directed repair (HDR). HDR involves strand invasion from the broken strand into regions of immediate homology on the intact chromosome, and synthesis across the intervening region to repair the gap. In the arrangement described this can lead to copying of the endonuclease, and its associated allele, from one chromosome to another in a process referred to as ‘homing’. If homing takes place in the germline then inheritance of the gene drive is biased because the majority of sperm or eggs produced in the germline will inherit the drive, on either the original gene drive-carrying chromosome or the newly converted chromosome. The rate of spread of this type of gene drive is thus a product of the rate of germline nuclease activity and the probability with which double stranded breaks are repaired by the host cell using HDR rather than end-joining repair.
Previous limitations of CRISPR-based homing gene drives
We and others have tested several gene drives designed to suppress or modify mosquito populations [6- 8]. With any gene drive the force of selection for resistance to the drive will be proportional to the fitness cost imposed by the drive. In the case of population suppression approaches, this selection falls on the mosquito. We previously built several CRISPR-based gene drives designed to achieve population suppression through disrupting female fertility genes and demonstrated their spread throughout caged populations of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae [7]. However, the drive was eventually replaced in the population by resistant mutations generated by end-joining repair in the fraction of cleaved chromosomes that were not modified by homing [9]. To ultimately replace the drive in a population, these mutations must also encode a functional copy of the target gene so that they restore fertility to females.
In determining the propensity for target site resistance to arise, functional constraint at the target site is paramount to determine the degree of variation that can be tolerated there. The target site sequence in the first iteration of a population suppression gene drives is poorly conserved [7], suggesting little functional constraint, and therefore is particularly prone to accommodating resistant alleles that restore function to the target gene (‘r1’ alleles, as opposed to ‘r2’ alleles which are resistant to cleavage but do not restore function to the target gene) (Supplementary Figure 1) [9, 10]. The importance of choosing functionally constrained sites was shown when a gene drive targeting a highly conserved target sequence in the female-specific isoform of a sex determination gene was able to crash caged populations without selecting for resistant mutations of the r1 class [8]. Notwithstanding this success, it is unlikely that any single site will be completely ‘resistance-proof’. This is true for any suppressive technology, from antibiotics to insecticides, and measures to prolong the durability of these interventions need to be considered at inception.

In addition to multiplexing gene drives to recognise more than one target site [3, 4, 11], akin to combination therapy with antibiotics, it is necessary to reduce the relative contribution of the error- prone end-joining repair pathway, over HDR, since this can serve to increase the range and complexity of potential resistant alleles on which selection could act.
Cleavage by maternally deposited nuclease in the embryo is believed to be the major source of end- joining mutations in current gene drive designs [6, 9, 12]. We have previously observed high levels of end-joining repair in the embryo following strong maternal deposition using the vas2 promoter. This is likely a consequence of germline expression that persists through oocyte development leading to perduring Cas9 transcript and/or protein in the newly fertilised embryo. Additionally, using the same promoter, unrestricted activity of the endonuclease outside of the mosquito germline caused a strong unintended fitness cost in females harbouring a single copy of the gene drive, due to partial conversion of the soma to the homozygosity for a null allele. These fitness effects retarded the invasive potential of the drive for two reasons: 1- reduced bias in inheritance each generation due to low fecundity of drive- carrying (heterozygous) females; 2- increased selection pressure for resistant mutations [9].
Given the limitations of the promoter in previous gene drive constructs we decided to test a suite of novel germline promoters for their ability to restrict nuclease activity to the germline. We employed genetic screens to get a quantitative and qualitative determination of the mutations arising from the different gene drive constructs that, importantly, allowed us to determine where the mutations were generated. We then employed the best performing constructs in a cage invasion assay to determine how our single generation estimates of homing performance translated to our mathematical models of penetrance and population suppression over time, while tracking the emergence of resistant alleles.
Results and Discussion
Choice of germline promoters
To find alternatives to the vas2 promoter, we investigated three mosquito genes, AGAP006241 (zero population growth, zpg), AGAP006098 (nanos, nos) and AGAP007365 (exuperantia, exu), that are expressed in the germline of male and female Anopheles gambiae [13] and may show reduced somatic expression or deposition into the embryo.
In Drosophila the gene zpg is specifically expressed in the male and female germline, where it mediates the formation of gap junctions between the developing germline and cyst cells [14]. The mosquito ortholog of zpg appears to be functionally conserved as it is essential for both male and female gonad development [15]. Exu and nos are maternal effect genes in Drosophila that are transcribed in the oocyte and deposited into the early embryo [16-18]. Crucially, deposited nos and zpg mRNA concentrate at the germ plasm due to regulatory signals present on the untranslated regions, which also further restrict translation of maternal mRNAs to the germline [14, 19]. The promoter region of exuperantia has been validated in Drosophila [20] and in the tiger mosquito, Aedes aegypti, has been used to drive robust expression in both male and female germlines and has recently been used to control expression of Cas9 in a split gene drive system in this mosquito [21, 22]. In contrast to zpg and exu, several reports have suggested that nos is specific to the female germline in mosquitoes, however promoter fusions in Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae led to low level expression in males perhaps due to incomplete recapitulation of endogenous gene expression [23-25].

Generation of new gene drives designed to restrict spatiotemporal expression to the mosquito germline
To determine the effect of transcriptional control of gene drive activity, we tested the new constructs at a previously validated female fertility locus that was prone to resistance [9], in order to quantify any reduction in the creation or selection of resistant mutations that resulted from reducing embryonic end- joining and improving female fertility, respectively.
The target site in question resides within the gene AGAP007280 (Fig. 1A), an ortholog of the Drosophila gene nudel required in the follicle cells to define polarity of the eggshell [26, 27]. Null mutations at this target site cause a recessive female sterile phenotype. The active gene drive cassette (CRISPRh) used previously to target AGAP007280 [7] was modified to contain Cas9 under control regulatory sequences flanking upstream and downstream of either zpg , nos or exu genes. The CRISPRh constructs were inserted within the AGAP007280 target site, by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange, as previously [7] (Fig. 1B). The new gene drive strains were named nos-CRISPRh, zpg-CRISPRh, exu-CRISPRh, respectively.

(b) CRISPRh alleles were inserted at the target in AGAP007280 using φC31-recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RCME). Each CRISPRh RCME vector was designed to contain Cas9 under transcriptional control of the nos, zpg or exu germline promoter and terminator, a gRNA targeted to AGAP007280 under the control of the ubiquitous U6 PolIII promoter, and a 3xP3::DsRed marker.
Zpg and nos promoters drive high levels of homing in the germline and vary in
magnitude of maternal effect
Germline gene drive activity that leads to homing is expected to cause super-Mendelian inheritance of the drive. However, maternally-deposited Cas9 has the potential to cause resistant mutations in the embryo that may reduce the rate of homing during gamete formation (if the mutations occur in

germline precursor cells) or reduce fertility (due to somatic mosaicism of null mutations in the target fertility gene) [6, 9, 10, 12, 28].
Assays were performed to measure the transmission rates and fertility costs associated with each of three drives (Fig. 2). Individuals heterozygous for the gene drive were crossed to wild type and their progeny scored for the presence of the DsRed marker gene linked to the construct. To test the magnitude of any parental effect, gene drive carriers were separated according to whether they received their gene drive allele paternally or maternally. Data from our previously generated gene drive constructs under control of the vasa promoter (vas2-CRISPRh) served as a benchmark [7].
When the gene drive was received paternally zpg-CRISPRh transmission rates of 93.5% (±1.5% s.e.m.) in males and 97.8% (±0.6% s.e.m.) in females were observed, falling only slightly below the vas2-CRISPRh rates in the equivalent cross (99.6% ±0.3% s.e.m. in males and 97.7% ±1.6% s.e.m. in females) (Fig. 2D, Fig. 2B). The paternally-received nos-CRISPRh construct showed comparable rates to vas2-CRISPRh, with 99.6% (±0.3% s.e.m.) inheritance in females and 99.1% (±0.3% s.e.m.) inheritance in males. In contrast, paternally-received exu-CRISPRh showed only modest homing rates in males (65.0% ±2.0% s.e.m. transmission rate) and no homing in females (Fig. 2H).
When the gene drive was received maternally, the vas2-CRISPRh constructs showed a large reduction in homing in males (60.2% ±1.9% s.e.m. inheritance rate, equivalent to homing of 20.2% of non-drive chromosomes) compared to those that received the drive paternally (99.2% homing of non-drive chromosomes) (Fig. 2B). On the contrary, for the zpg-CRISPRh construct, we saw minimum transmission rates of 90.6% (±1.8% s.e.m.) in males and a higher rate of 99.1% in females (±0.4% s.e.m.) (p&lt;0.01), yet no significant maternal or paternal effect (Fig. 2D). With the nos-CRISPRh construct, though homing rates were still high, we saw a strong maternal effect leading to reduction in homing performance in both males (83.6% ±5.0% s.e.m. inheritance when inherited maternally vs 99.1% ±0.4% s.e.m. when paternally inherited, p&lt;0.05) and females (85.2% ±5.0% s.e.m. vs 99.6% ±0.3% s.e.m., respectively, p&lt;0.001) (Fig. 2F). This suggests that Cas9 from the nos-CRISPRh construct is maternally deposited, though to a lesser extent than the vas2-CRISPRh constructs, and active in a way that leads to the formation of alleles in the zygotic germline that are resistant to homing in the next generation. Finally, maternally-inherited exu-CRISPRh constructs showed modest homing rates in males (63.1% ±2.4% s.e.m. inheritance), unaffected by parental effects, though the absence of gene drive activity in females (51.8% ±1.7% s.e.m. inheritance) may imply that there was simply insufficient nuclease expression in the female germline to produce a maternal effect (Fig. 2H).

Figure 2. Comparison of fecundity and homing rates in mosquitoes containing Cas9-based gene drives under regulation of zpg, nos and exu germline promoters. Phenotypic assays were performed to measure fertility and transmission rates for each of three drives. The larval output was determined for individual drive heterozygotes crossed to wild type (left, B,D,F,H), and their progeny scored for the presence of DsRed linked to the construct (right,C,E,G,I). Average transmission rates are shown on the right of panels B, D, F, H and relative fecundity to wild type is depicted on the right of panels C, E, G, I (Kruskal-Wallis test, ∗∗∗∗: p &lt; 0.0001, ∗∗∗: p &lt; 0.001,∗∗: p &lt; 0.01, ns: non-significant). Males and females were further separated by whether they
had inherited the CRISPRh construct from either a male or female parent. For example, ♂→♀ denotes progeny and transmission
rates of a heterozygous CRISPRh female that had inherited the drive allele from a heterozygous CRISPRh male. High levels of homing were observed in the germline of zpg-CRISPRh and nos-CRISPRh males and females, however the exu promoter generated only moderate levels of homing in the germline of males but not females. The significant maternal effect upon homing performance in offspring previously seen for vas2-CRISPRh (Hammond et al. 2017, shown here) was also observed in nos-CRISPRh, but not for zpg-CRISPRh (Mann-Whitney, ∗∗∗∗: p &lt; 0.0001, ∗∗∗: p &lt; 0.001, ∗: p &lt; 0.05, ns: non-significant). Counts of hatched larvae for the individual crosses revealed improvements in the fertility of heterozygous females containing CRISPRh alleles based upon zpg, nos and exu promoters compared to the vas2 promoter. Phenotypic assays were performed on G2 and
G3 for zpg, G3 and G4 for nos, and ~G15 for exu. ♀* denotes vas2-CRISPRh females that were heterozygous for a resistance (r1) allele, these were used because heterozygous vas2-CRISPRh females are usually sterile.

New gene drive constructs confer significantly less fecundity costs in carrier females than previous constructs
Fecundity assays were performed to quantify the number of viable progeny (measured as larval output) in individual crosses of drive heterozygotes mated to wild type (Fig. 2). Our previously published data for vas2-CRISPRh females showed vastly impaired fecundity (8% fecund, relative to wild type) in females heterozygous for this construct at the AGAP007280 locus, despite this gene showing full haplosufficiency for this phenotype (i.e. individuals heterozygous for a simple null allele show normal fecundity)[7]. The most parsimonious explanation for this fitness effect is the (partial) conversion of the soma to the null phenotype, due to two sources: somatic ‘leakiness’ of the putative germline promoter driving the Cas9 nuclease; the stochastic distribution (mosaicism) across the soma and germline of nuclease parentally deposited into the embryo.
Both the zpg-CRISPRh and the nos-CRISPRh drives showed a general marked improvement in relative female fecundity over the previous vas2-driven construct, with maximal fecundities (compared to wild type) of 54.9% and 55.5%, respectively. Although we observed significant maternal deposition from the nos-CRISPRh construct, the reduction in fecundity of females that received the gene drive maternally was non-significant, compared to those that received the drive paternally (39.7% ±8.5% s.e.m. vs 55.5% ±7.3 s.e.m. larval output respectively) (Fig. 2G). For this construct we also noted a general reduction in male fecundity, regardless of paternal source of the gene drive allele. For zpg-CRISPRh we observed no reduction in male fecundity and the reduction in female fecundity was not subject to any maternal effect, consistent with the absence of maternal effect on homing for the same construct. Thus, the most likely explanation for the improved performance of the zpg-CRISPRh gene drive is the lack of a maternal effect, though the incomplete restoration of full fecundity in heterozygote females suggests there may still be some somatic leakiness.
Embryonic and germline rates of end-joining induced by gene drives containing zpg and nos promoters
Given its importance in the generation of resistant alleles, we designed a genetic screen to quantify the magnitude of parental nuclease deposition from each construct (Fig 3A). In this screen the wild-type target allele in the embryo, balanced against a pre-existing r1 allele (a 6bp GAGGAG deletion) is only exposed to a paternal or maternal dose of the nuclease in the absence of a genetically encoded drive construct. We performed amplicon sequencing of the relevant region of the AGAP007280 target locus to sample and quantify the diversity of alleles at the target site. Two replicates were performed for each cross. In the absence of any Cas9 activity an equal ratio of the wild-type target site and the original r1 allele is expected among the chromosomes amplified. Novel indels arising at the target sequence are indicative of nuclease activity in the zygote as a result of parental deposition. The original r1 allele may also be over-represented among the F2 in this assay due to simple stochastic variation in its Mendelian inheritance or due to deposited Cas9 activity, either as a result of de novo generation through end- joining repair, or as a result of gene conversion through homing of the inherited r1 allele. Taking only the most conservative signal of embryonic end-joining (indels unique from the inherited r1 allele sequence), vas2-CRISPRh generated high levels of maternally deposited Cas9 activity – affecting 70% of all nuclease-sensitive alleles (Figure 3B and Supp Figure 3). In the offspring of nos-CRISPRh females the end-joining rates from maternal deposition were substantially lower (10.5% of nuclease-sensitive alleles), with no significant paternal deposition. For the zpg-CRISPRh line, we found no significant signal of maternal or paternal deposition (Supp Figure 3).

Mutant alleles generated in the embryo, if included in the germline tissue, will be resistant to subsequent homing during the production of gametes in the adult, reducing rates of drive transmission. Indeed, the gradation in terms of maternal contribution to end joining in the embryo (vas2-CRISPRh &gt; nos-CRISPRh &gt; zpg-CRISPRh) mirrors the magnitude of the maternal effect observed in reducing drive transmission for each construct (Figure 2). Consistent with this, the presence in the F3 of novel end- joining mutations that were created in the F2 confirms that deposited nuclease affected also the germline tissue (Figure 3C). However, the frequency of resistant alleles generated in the F2 was approximately halved in the F3, consistent with their simple Mendelian inheritance. This indicates that any contribution of deposited nuclease to homing of these alleles in the germline is at best minimal. This is in contrast to reports in Drosophila where use of the nanos promoter can lead to ‘shadow drive’ in which perduring maternally deposited Cas9 can cause in homing in the germline even in the absence of genetically encoded Cas9 [29, 30].
Figure 3. Heritability and rates of formation of mutations caused by parentally deposited nuclease from different gene drive constructs. (A) zpg-CRISPRh, nos-CRISPRh or vas2-CRISPRh were crossed to a homozygous resistant strain (r1 203-GAGGAG) to generate F1 heterozygotes containing both a gene drive and resistant allele (GD/r1). F1 heterozygotes and r1/r1 homozygotes (control) were crossed to wild type and their non-drive F2 progeny analysed by pooled amplicon sequencing across the target site in AGAP007280. (B) Amplicon sequencing results from F2 individuals with genotype wt/R1 (selected by absence of dsRED- linked gene drive allele) whose only source of Cas9 nuclease would be from parental deposition into the embryo. In the absence of any deposited source of nuclease only the original r1 allele and the wt allele are expected, at a ratio of 1:1 (C) Amplicon sequencing of F3 progeny deriving from the F2 crossed to wild type. Mendelian inheritance of mutations present in the F2 would be expected to lead to a 2-fold reduction in their frequency between the F2 and F3.
Given the improved characteristics of the zpg-CRISPRh construct in terms of fecundity and reduced embryonic end-joining we also investigated its propensity to generate end-joining mutants in the germline. We designed a genetic cross that allowed us to enrich and capture those chromosomes (~2- 3%) that were subjected to the nuclease activity of the zpg-CRISPRh gene drive in the adult germline but were not ‘homed’ (Fig 4). Interestingly from males (n=240) we noticed a much greater heterogeneity of alleles (82 mutated chromosomes covered by 18 distinct alleles) among those generated from end- joining repair than we did in females (n=219) where the vast majority (88%) of non-homed chromosomes were mutated but these comprised just 4 unique alleles. The apparent differences between the male and female germlines may reflect differences in the timing of nuclease activity and

chromosomal repair, and may suggest that early repair events in the female germline, when only a few germline stem cells are present, leads to a clustering of repair events among the eventual gametes.
Figure 4. The rate and outcome of meiotic end-joining (EJ) differs in the male and female germline. F0 females (n&gt;500) or males (n&gt;200) heterozygous for the gene drive (linked to RFP+) (GD) were crossed to GFP+ docking line (DL). The rare fraction (~3%) of F1 progeny that had inherited a DL but not a GD allele were selected and their non-drive allele (ND), that had been meiotically exposed to nuclease activity, was sequenced to reveal the frequency and nature of EJ mutations taking place during meiosis (offspring from females n=219; offspring from males n=240). The frequency of all WT unmodified alleles is shown in grey. Mutant alleles individually exceeding 1% frequency were identified as r1 (orange) or r2 (blue). Mutations present at less than 1% frequency were grouped together as in-frame (light orange) or out-of-frame (light blue).
zpg-CRISPRh spreads to close to fixation in caged releases and exerts a large reproductive load on the population
Given its improved fecundity and its lower mutagenic activity we investigated the potential for the zpg- CRISPRh gene drive to spread throughout naïve mosquito populations. Two replicate cages were initiated with either 10% or 50% starting frequency of drive heterozygotes, and monitored for 16 generations, which included pooled sequencing of the target locus at various generations. The drive spread rapidly in all four trials, to more than 97% of the population, achieving maximal frequency in just 4-10 generations (Figure 5a). In each trial, the drive sustained more than 95% frequency for at least 3 generations before its spread was reversed by the gradual selection of drive-resistant alleles. Notably, we observed similar dynamics of spread, in terms of rate of increase and duration of maximal frequency, whether the gene drive was released at 50% or 10%, demonstrating that initial release frequency has little impact (providing it is not stochastically lost initially) upon the potential to spread.
The rates of invasion observed here represent a significant improvement over the first generation gene drive (vas2-CRISPRh) targeted to the exact same target sequence (included for comparison in Figure 5a), where the spread of the drive was markedly slower and declined before it reached 80% frequency in the population [7].

Figure 5. zpg-CRISPRh rates of spread through caged populations, reproductive load and real-time profiling of resistance. zpg- CRISPRh/+ were released into replicate caged WT populations at 10% (right) or 50% (middle) CRISPRh/+ initial frequency. (a) The frequency of drive-modified mosquitoes (solid line) was recorded each generation by screening larval progeny for presence of DsRed linked to the CRISPRh allele. Entire egg output per generation was also recorded (dashed line). zpg-CRISPRh drive spread was compared to previous results for vas2-CRISPRh (left panel) from Hammond et al. (2017). (b) The nature and frequency of non-drive alleles was determined for several generations (arrows) of the caged population experiments by amplicon sequencing across the target site at AGAP007280 in pooled samples. The frequency of all WT alleles is shown in grey. Mutant alleles individually exceeding 1% frequency in any generation were labelled as r1 (orange) or r2 (blue). Mutations that were individually present at less than 1% frequency were grouped together as in-frame (light orange) or out-of-frame (light blue).
Our population suppression gene drive is designed to exert a reproductive load on the population by targeting a gene that is essential for viable egg production. To investigate the magnitude of this load, we counted (from generation 4) the number of viable eggs produced each generation to measure the level of population suppression. Egg production was suppressed by an average of 92% (compared to maximal output of the cage) in each cage at or shortly after the peak in drive frequency, representing a reduction from more than 15,000 eggs to under 1,200 eggs. Since we set a fixed carrying capacity for the adult population in the cage, selecting 600 larvae each generation, the reduction in egg output, although severe, was insufficient to suppress the population below this carrying capacity. In practice, in the wild, the effect of these levels of reproductive suppression will depend very much on the strength of density- dependent mortality that is occurring in the relevant mosquito larval habitats [31, 32].
The creation and selection of resistant mutations is delayed in cage invasion experiments when using the zpg promoter
Both r1 mutations and r2 mutations can retard the invasiveness of a gene drive, yet r1 mutations are more problematic since they are likely to be strongly selected due to the relative positive fitness they confer by restoring function to the target gene. To determine the rate of accumulation of these

mutations during the invasion experiment we sequenced across the target locus in samples of pooled individuals from intermittent generations that spanned the rise and fall in frequency of the gene drive (Figure 5b).
For the zpg-CRISPRh constructs, which have minimal fitness effects in carrier females (containing one drive allele and one wild type allele), resistance did not show obvious signs of selection (judged by large increases in frequency) until more than 90% of individuals were positive for the gene drive. In contrast, our previous data for the vas2-driven constructs showed that resistance was selected much earlier, being already present at high frequency in the 2nd generation when the frequency of drive-positive individuals was less than 70%. This is likely due to a combination of factors: the somatic leakiness of the vas2 promoter resulting in a significant fitness cost in carrier females and thus a relative fitness benefit to the r1 allele at a much earlier stage in the invasion, even when drive homozygotes are still rare; the high initial frequency of r2 alleles, resulting in many individuals that are null (either homozygous for the r2 allele or contain one r2 allele and one drive allele) for the target gene therefore meaning that any non-null allele has a stronger relative fitness advantage.
Not only does the zpg promoter delay the onset of drive resistance, it also reduces the range of resistant alleles created (Fig 5b). In the 50% release cages, only 2 mutant alleles were detected above threshold frequency (&gt;1% of non-drive alleles) both of which had been previously confirmed to be of the r1 class. By generation 8, one of the two had spread to more than 90% frequency yet the dominant allele was reversed in the replicate cages – suggesting that selection for one or the other resistant mutations is stochastic and not because one is more effective at restoring fertility. The equivalent release of vas2- CRISPRh generated 9-12 mutant alleles above 1% frequency by generation 2 and this variance was maintained over time despite a strong stratification towards those of the r1 class [9]. This reduced complexity of alleles generated by zpg-CRISPRh may be related to the late onset of resistance, when the majority of alleles at the target locus are drive alleles meaning that there are very few ‘free’ alleles on which r1 alleles can be generated, resulting in the stochastic selection of just a few.
The very late onset of resistance - if it is to occur - is a feature, not immediately intuitive, of this type of suppression drive. Selection for r1 alleles only really becomes strong when the gene drive is close to fixation - when most individuals have at least one copy of the gene drive the relative advantage of an r1 allele over remaining WT alleles (that have a high probability of being removed by homing of the gene drive allele) or the drive allele (with high probability of finding itself in a barren female, homozygous for the drive) is at its highest.
Incorporating experimental rates of resistance, embryonic end-joining and homology
directed repair into a population model
We extend previous models of homing-based gene drives [9, 33, 34], allowing the option of embryonic activity from paternally and maternally derived nuclease that can be resolved through end-joining - forming r1 and r2 alleles - or HDR. Using this model (see Supplementary Methods) and the baseline parameter values from rates of fecundity and repair outcomes following germline and embryonic nuclease activity (Supp Tables 1 and 2) we generated the expected dynamics of spread and population egg output over the 16 generations of the experiment (Figure 6). For both 50% and 10% releases, the model captures the general trend of initial spread that is met by a significant suppression in egg output and an eventual recovery of the population as the gene drive is replaced by resistant mutations. Notably, the observed dynamics of spread and population suppression were faster than the

deterministic prediction in all replicates. This may be explained by sensitivity of the model to the fertility of female zpg-CRISPRh heterozygotes and the extent to which fertility is restored by resistant R1 alleles (Supplementary Figure 2) – two parameters that are particularly difficult to measure experimentally [7, 9]. Interestingly, these parameters exert their effect upon drive dynamics in concert: improvements to heterozygous female fertility increase the rate of spread and peak in drive frequency, whereas an r1 allele that fails to restore full wild-type fertility retards the rate at which the drive is removed from the population.
Figure 6. Comparison of observed zpg-CRISPRh drive frequency and egg output data to deterministic and stochastic model predictions. zpg-CRISPRh/+ individuals were released into replicate caged WT populations at 50% (left) or 10% (right) initial frequency of CRISPRh/+. The frequency of drive-modified mosquitoes (top panels) and the entire egg output per generation (bottom panels) were recorded. Observed data were compared to a deterministic, discrete-generation model (dashed line) based upon observed rates of fertility, homing, and resistance generated by end-joining in the germline and embryo (Supp Table S1). Grey lines show 20 stochastic simulations assuming that females may fail to mate, or mate once with a male of a given genotype according to its frequency in the male population; mated females produce eggs in amounts determined by sampling with replacement from experimental values that subsequently hatch according to the genotype of the mother; of the 600 larvae chosen randomly to populate next generation, some fail to survive to adulthood. Probabilities of mating, egg production, hatching and survival from larval stage to adult are estimated from experiment (Supp Table S2) and random numbers for these events drawn from the appropriate multinomial distributions. Model egg counts for each release are normalised such that the deterministic value corresponds to the average of the two replicate cage experiments at generation sixteen.
Conclusions
Building suppression gene drives for mosquito control that are fit for purpose requires a combination of the following features: optimal target sites that show high functional constraint; the targeting of multiple sites by the same gene drive construct; fine tuning of the expression of the nuclease that serves as the gene drive’s ‘motor’ in order that the drive shows the most efficient invasion dynamics. A number of these theorised improvements to design have been substantiated: multiplexing through the use of multiple guide RNAs in a single drive construct has been shown to improve robustness of the drive [12, 20, 35]; judicious choice of functionally constrained sites in essential genes has meant that gene drives targeting such sites do not generate resistant alleles that are selected, at least in the laboratory [8, 35]. For the last aspect – optimising expression - we have shown here that simple changes to the promoter controlling nuclease activity can lead to drastic improvements in the speed of invasion due to two

principle reasons: 1) less propensity to induce end-joining repair in the germline and 2) improved fecundity of ‘carrier’ females that contain a single copy of the gene drive and transmit it in a super- Mendelian fashion to their offspring.
The combined effect of the improvements conferred by the zpg promoter meant that a gene drive targeting a female fertility gene, at a site otherwise extremely prone to generate resistance [9], could still spread close to fixation while imposing a very strong reproductive load before resistant alleles eventually became selected.
The propensity for maternal and paternal deposition of the nuclease under control of the promoters of the drive constructs is an important variable that we have shown can vary greatly. There is also the possibility that both the end-joining/HDR ratio and the magnitude of parental effect might additionally be locus dependent to some extent [12, 29]. Indeed when the zpg promoter was used to control expression of a homing based gene drive at the doublesex locus we noticed a paternal effect contributing to reduced fecundity that was not observed here [8].
Our data on the relative contributions of end-joining repair and homology-directed repair in the germline and in the early embryo will be particularly important for the modelling of expected performance of gene drive constructs in mosquito populations, not only for suppressive drives but for so-called population replacement drives that also rely on CRISPR-based homing activity [6, 36]. This data, coupled with the improvements to drive performance conferred by promoter choice, should help expedite the building of effective gene drives for mosquito control.
Methods
Amplification of promoter and terminator sequences
In determining the length of upstream region to take from each candidate gene to serve as a promoter we took a maximal region of 2kb upstream of the coding sequence, or the entire intergenic distance to the end of the coding sequence of the neighbouring gene, if shorter. The published Anopheles gambiae genome sequence provided in Vectorbase [37] was used as a reference to design primers in order to amplify the promoters and terminators of the three Anopheles gambiae genes: AGAP006098 (nanos), AGAP006241 (zero population growth) and AGAP007365 (exuperantia). Using the primers provided in Supplementary Table 3 we performed PCRs on 40 ng of genomic material extracted from wild type mosquitoes of the G3 strain using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). The primers were modified to contain suitable Gibson assembly overhangs (underlined) for subsequent vector assembly, and an XhoI restriction site upstream of the start codon. Promoter and terminator fragments were 2092 bp and 601 bp for nos, 1074 bp and 1034 bp for zpg, and 849 and 1173 bp for exu, respectively. The sequences of all regulatory fragments can be found in Supplementary Table 4
Generation of CRISPRh drive constructs
We modified available template plasmids used previously in Hammond et al. (2016) to replace and test alternative promoters and terminators for expressing the Cas9 protein in the germline of the mosquito. p16501, which was used in that study carried a human optimised Cas9 (hCas9) under the control of the vas2 promoter and terminator, an RFP cassette under the control of the neuronal 3xP3 promoter and a U6:sgRNA cassette targeting the AGAP007280 gene in Anopheles gambiae.

The hCas9 fragment and backbone (sequence containing 3xP3::RFP and a U6::gRNA cassette), were excised from plasmid p16501 using the restriction enzymes XhoI+PacI and AscI+AgeI respectively. Gel electrophoresis fragments were then re-assembled with PCR amplified promoter and terminator sequences of zpg, nos or exu by Gibson assembly to create new CRISPRh vectors named p17301 (nos), p17401 (zpg) and p17501 (exu).
Integration of gene drive constructs at the AGAP007280 locus
CRISPRh constructs containing Cas9 under control of the zpg, nos and exu promoters were inserted into an hdrGFP docking site previously generated at the target site in AGAP007280 (Hammond et al., 2016). Briefly, Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes of the hdrGFP-7280 strain were reared under standard conditions of 80% relative humidity and 28oC, and freshly laid embryos used for microinjections as described before[38]. Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RCME) reactions were performed by injecting each of the new CRISPRh constructs into embryos of the hdrGFP docking line that was previously generated at the target site in AGAP007280 [7]. For each construct, embryos were injected with solution containing CRISPRh (400ng/μl) and a vas2::integrase helper plasmid (400ng/μl)[39]. Surviving G0 larvae were crossed to wild type and transformants were identified by a change from GFP (present in the hdrGFP docking site) to DsRed linked to the CRISPRh construct that should indicate successful RCME.
Phenotypic assays to measure fertility and rates of homing
Heterozygous CRISPRh/+ mosquitoes from each of the three new lines zpg-CRISPRh, nos-CRISPRh, zpg- CRISPRh, were mated to an equal number of wild type mosquitoes for 5 days in reciprocal male and female crosses. Females were blood fed on anesthetized mice on the sixth day and after 3 days, a minimum of 40 were allowed to lay individually into a 25-ml cup filled with water and lined with filter paper. The entire larval progeny of each individual was counted and a minimum of 50 larvae were screened to determine the frequency of the DsRed that is linked to the CRISPRh allele by using a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE200). Females that failed to give progeny and had no evidence of sperm in their spermathecae were excluded from the analysis. Statistical differences between genotypes were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests.
Caged Population Invasion Experiments
The cage trials were performed following the same principle described before in Hammond et al. (2016). Briefly, heterozygous zpg-CRISPRh that had inherited the drive from a female parent were mixed with age-matched wild type at L1 at 10% or 50% frequency of heterozygotes. At the pupal stage, 600 were selected to initiate replicate cages for each initial release frequency. Adult mosquitoes were left to mate for 5 days before they were blood fed on anesthetized mice. Two days after, the mosquitoes were left to lay in a 300 ml egg bowl filled with water and lined with filter paper. Each generation, all eggs were allowed two days to hatch and 600 randomly selected larvae were screened to determine the transgenic rate by presence of DsRed and then used to seed the next generation. From generation 4 onwards, adults were blood-fed a second time and the entire egg output photographed and counted using JMicroVision V1.27. Larvae were reared in 2L trays in 500ml of water, allowing a density of 200 larvae per tray. After recovering progeny, the entire adult population was collected and entire samples from generations 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12 (50% release) and 0, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15 (10% release) were used for pooled amplicon sequence analysis.
Pooled amplicon sequencing
Pooled amplicon sequencing was performed essentially as described before in Hammond et al. (2017). Genomic DNA was mass extracted from pooled samples of mosquitoes using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega), and 90 ng of each used for PCR using KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix PCR kit

(Kapa Biosystems) in 50 ul reactions. For caged experiment generations 0, 2, 5 &amp; 8, a 332 bp locus spanning the target site was amplified using primers designed to include the Illumina Nextera Transposase Adapters (underlined), 7280-Illumina-F (TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGGAGAAGGTAAATGCGCCAC) and 7280-Illumina-R (GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGCGCTTCTACACTCGCTTCT). For caged experiment generations 4, 6, 7 and 12 of the 50% release; and 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15 of the 10% release, a 196 bp locus spanning the target site was amplified using primers were designed to include Illumina partial adapters (underlined), Illumina-AmpEZ-7280-F1 (ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTCGTTAACTGTCTTGGTGGTGAGG) and Illumina-AmpEZ-7280- R1 (GACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTCACGCTTAACGTCGTCGTTTC). For deposition testing, a 200 bp locus spanning the target site was amplified using primers designed to include Illumina partial adapters (underlined), Illumina-AmpEZ-7280-F2 (ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTCGGGCAAGAAGTGTAACGG) and Illumina-AmpEZ-7280-R2 (TGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTGTCGTTTCTTCCGATGTGAAC). PCR reactions were amplified for 20 cycles and subsequently processed and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq instrument (Genewiz).
Analysis of pooled amplicon sequencing
Pooled amplicon sequencing reads were analysed using CRISPResso software v1.0.8 [40] using an average read quality threshold of 30. Insertions and deletions were included if they altered a window of 20 bp surrounding the cleavage site that was chosen on the basis of previously observed mutations at this locus [9]. Allele frequencies were calculated by summing individual insertion or deletion events across all haplotypes on which they were found. A large insertion event, representing incomplete homing of CRISPRh, was found to occur outside of this window and its combined frequency across several haplotypes was calculated and included in the final frequency tables.
Deposition Testing
F1 heterozygotes containing a gene drive and resistant allele (GD/r1) were generated by crossing zpg- CRISPRh ,nos-CRISPRh or vas2-CRISPRh to a resistant strain that is homozygous for the 203-GAGGAG r1 allele at the target site in AGAP007280. This scheme allowed the testing of all gene drive constructs, including those (e.g. vas2-CRISPRh )would otherwise cause high levels of female sterility when balanced against a wild type allele" An average of 40 F1 heterozygotes were group mated to an excess of wild- type in reciprocal male and female crosses, and allowed to lay en masse. F2 progeny were screened for the absence of DsRed that is linked to the CRISPRh allele and pooled together for mass genomic DNA extraction and pooled amplicon sequencing as described elsewhere. A minimum of 118 F2 individuals were interrogated for each condition.
Estimation of Meiotic End-joining
A minimum of 200 male or 500 female zpg-CRISPRh drive heterozygotes (F0) were crossed to a line heterozygous for a GFP+ marked knock-out AGAP007280 allele and allowed to lay eggs. Upon egg- hatching, L1 larvae were sorted using COPAS (complex object parametric analyser and sorter), as in Marois et al. (2012). The very rare fraction of progeny (F1) that inherited the GFP+ marked knockout but not the zpg-CRISPRh allele due to lack of homing, were isolated from the progeny pool. They were grown to adulthood and their gDNA was individually extracted using either the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) or the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen). A 1048 bp region spanning the gene drive target site was amplified using primers Seq-7280-F (GCACAAATCCGATCGTGACA) and Seq- 7280-R3 (GGCTTCCAGTGGCAGTTCCGTA) and Sanger-sequenced using primer Seq-7280-F5 (CGTTTGTGTGTCAGAGCAAGTCG), so that only the allele that was exposed to prior nuclease activity meiotically would amplify (and not the GFP+ allele). In total, 219 F1 progeny descended from female

Supplementary Figure 1
Supplementary Figure 1. Cleavage by CRISPRh can generate resistant mutations as a by-product of error-prone end-joining. After cleavage by the nuclease, the majority of target sites will be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR), leading to a copying over of the CRISPRh allele called homing. A small fraction of targets may remain unmodified or may repair perfectly, resulting in a target that can be cleaved upon re-exposure by the nuclease. Chromosomes that are repaired by end-joining may generate a mutant target site that can no longer be cleaved by the nuclease. If the target site is essential (i.e. a female fertility gene), then a mutation that disrupts the function of the target gene, called an R2 mutation, will be selected out of the population. Mutations that re-code a functional target gene, called an R1 mutation, are resistant to the gene drive and will come under strong selection in presence of the drive.

Depletion of wild-type and formation of mutations caused by parentally deposited nuclease from different gene drive constructs. zpg-CRISPRh, nos-CRISPRh or vas2-CRISPRh were crossed to a homozygous resistant strain (r1 203-GAGGAG) to generate F1 heterozygotes containing both a gene drive and resistant allele (GD/r1). F1 heterozygotes and r1/r1 homozygotes (control) were crossed to wild type and their non-drive F2 progeny analysed by pooled amplicon sequencing across the target site in AGAP007280. Amplicon sequencing results from F2 individuals (A) with genotype wt/R1 (left) and their F3 progeny (B) deriving from the F2 crossed to wild type (right) reveal novel R alleles (top), depletion of wt (middle). Frequencies expected by Medelian inheritance of the wt allele are indicated (dashed line). Deposited nuclease significantly depleted wt and generated novel R for nos-CRISPRh and vas2-CRISPRh females in the F2, but not zpg-CRISPRh females, or males of any class (Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA, ∗∗∗∗: p &lt; 0.0001, ∗∗∗: p &lt; 0.001, ∗: p &lt; 0.05, ns: non-significant). Rates of embryonic EJ (tables) were estaminated by calculating the frequency of novel R amongst WT and novel R (in the F2), or by multiplying the frequency of novel R by 4 (in the F3), the dilution factor expected due to additional wt alleles received from the parents.

Supplementary Methods and Tables Supplementary Methods
Population genetics model
To model the results of the cage experiments, we use discrete-generation recursion equations for the genotype frequencies, treating males and females separately. ! (#) and % (#) denote the frequency
!!
of females (or males) of genotype &amp; = (/* in the total female (or male) population. We consider four
alleles, W (wildtype), D (driver), R" (functional resistant) and R# (non-functional resistant), and therefore ten basic genotypes. Both resistant alleles cause a change in the target sequence such that it is no longer recognised by the nuclease, but function of the target gene is restored fully or partially in R" alleles and destroyed in R# alleles.
Parental effects. We consider that further cleavage of the W allele and repair can occur in the embryo if nuclease is present, due to one or both contributing gametes derived from a parent with one or two driver alleles. Previously, embryonic end-joining was modelled as acting immediately in the zygote [1,2]; we consider here that individuals may be mosaics with intermediate phenotypes and therefore we model embryonic activity as causing mosaicism in both the soma, affecting female fitness [3], and also in germline cells, altering gene transmission [4]. No correlation is assumed between the effect on fitness and the effect on gene transmission.
Extending our models [3,4] to include two types of resistance (R"and R#), we denote mosaic
individuals with parental effects (i.e., on fitness and gene transmission rates) as W/W(/), W/D(/),
W/R"(/) and W/R#(/), where a = 10, 01 or 11 denotes nuclease from the mother, father or both.
Individuals without parental effects are denoted only as X/Y. Gametes are distinguished by whether
they carry deposited parental nuclease: W, R", and R# gametes are derived from parents that have
no drive allele and therefore carry no deposited nuclease, and gametes W∗, D∗, R∗ , R∗ are derived "#
from individuals with one or two copies of the drive allele and carry nuclease that is transmitted to the zygote. For example, W/R"(10) mosaic individuals start as zygotes that have either a W* or R"* egg from the mother and correspondingly R" or W sperm from the father, and due to the deposited nuclease, the wildtype allele may undergo further cleavage and embryonic end-joining and HDR in the embryo.
Fitness. Let 6! ≤ 1 represent the fitness of genotype i = X/Y relative to 6%% = 1 for the wild-type
homozygote. We assume no fitness effects in males. Fitness effects in females are manifested as
differences in the relative ability of genotypes to participate in reproduction. We assume the target
gene is needed for female participation in reproduction, thus D/D, D/R#, and R#/R# females do not
reproduce, and there is no reduction in fertility in females with only one copy of the gene if no
parental effects are present. To model parental effects on fitness (as in [3,4]), genotypes with parental
nucleaseW/W(/), W/D(/)andW/R (/),a=10,01or11,areassignedanintermediatefitness6"( , # &amp;'
6(" , or 6"" depending on whether nuclease was derived from a transgenic mother, father, or both &amp;' &amp;'
(no reduction in fitness of W/R" females with parental nuclease, because all cells in the soma have at least one functioning copy of the target gene). We assume that parental effects are the same whether the parent(s) had one or two drive alleles. For simplicity, the same baseline reduced fitness of 6"(, 6(", 6"" is assigned to all mosaic genotypes W/W(/), W/D(/) and W/R#(/) with maternal, paternal and maternal/paternal effects, a = 10, 01 or 11, with fitness estimated as the product of mean egg production values and hatching rates relative to wild-type in Supp. Table 1 (deterministic model).

Gene transmission. We model parental effects on rates of gene transmission from mosaics W/W(/), W/D(/), W/R"(/) and W/R#(/), a = 10, 01 or 11, by assuming that parentally-derived nuclease can be active in the germline, leading to mosaicism that affects the types and proportions of gametes contributed.
Overall gene transmission from drive individuals includes both greater-than-Mendelian inheritance
of the drive allele from germline W/D cells and possible parental effects due to nuclease deposition
in the embryo. To incorporate observed measurements of drive into the model, we define overall
rates of transmission from W/D individuals, with the proportions of gametes W∗ : D∗ : R∗ : R∗ (all "#
carry parental nuclease) from W/D(a) individuals depending upon whether the deposited nuclease is from the mother, father, or both (/ = 10, 01 or 11):
=1 − ?+@=1 − A+@: ?+: =1 − ?+@A+(1 − B): =1 − ?+@A+B in females ***** **
(1−?+ )(1−A+ ):?+ :(1−?+ )A+ (1−B):(1−?+ )A+ B inmales ,,,,, ,,
Here, ?+ and ?+ are the observed rates of transmission of the driver allele in the two sexes, A+ and *,*
A+ are the fractions of non-drive gametes that are resistant (R∗ and R∗ alleles), and B is the fraction ,"#
of resistant alleles that are non-functional R∗ alleles. #
In mosaic types W/W (/), W/R"(/), and W/R#(/) with a = 10, 01 or 11 for parental effects due to nuclease deposition from mother, father or both, we define the proportion of wild-type alleles in the germline stem cells that are cleaved and repaired to resistant alleles (R" and R#) by end joining as C"(, C(", C""with nuclease from mother, father or both, and the proportion repaired by HDR as D"(, D(", D"". These parameters are estimated from deposition experiments on W/R1 individuals. Supp. Table S5 shows the resulting proportions of different genotypes among germline stem cells (rows) in gonads of mosaic types W/W (/), W/R"(/), and W/R#(/), / = 10, 01 or 11 (columns). Gamete production from W/W, W/R" and W/R# germline stem cells in mosaic individuals is assumed to be Mendelian, since we assume that parental nuclease is no longer active. The resulting proportions of gametes contributed from each type of individual is summarized in Supp. Table 6, along with the fitness for each.
Recursion equations. We now consider the gamete contributions from each genotype, including parental effects on fitness and gene transmission. The proportion E- (#) (and F- (#)) of type k gametes in eggs (and sperm) produced by females (and males) participating in reproduction is given by:
E(#)=∑#" A 6!(#)/6I(#) eggs - !/" !,- ! ! *
F ( # ) = ∑ # " A % ( # ) / 6I ( # ) s p e r m - !/"!,-! ,
Above, ! (#) and % (#) correspond to the frequencies of female/male individuals of type i in the !!
female/male population, where &amp; is summed over the twenty-one individual types (this includes genotypes ! (#) and % (#) without parental effects: W/W, W/R1, W/ R2, D/D, D/R1, D/ R2 , R1/R1,
'0 '0
R1/R2, and R2/R2 and also mosaics !+(#) and %+(#)of genotypes i = W/W, W/D, W/R and !!"
W/R# distinguished according to parental effect, / = 10, 01 or 11). The seven gamete types are
distinguished by both the allele that they carry and whether they carry deposited nuclease: K = W,
R , and R (without parental nuclease) and W∗, D∗, R∗ , R∗ (with parental nuclease). The coefficients "# "#
A!,- correspond to the proportion of gametes of type K from individuals of type &amp; and are given in Supp. Table S6, with row i corresponding to an individual of type i and columns to proportions of

mothers of: !"( (# = 0) = %"( (# = 0) = 0.1 (for 10% release) or 0.5 (for 50% release). The &amp;1 &amp;1

progeny, after the starting generation, genotype frequencies of type &amp; in the next generation (# + 1)
are the same in males and females, !(#+1)=%(#+1). Both are both given by S(#+1) in the !!!

Stochastic version. In the stochastic version of the model described above, random values for probabilistic events are taken from the appropriate multinomial distributions, with probabilities estimated from experiment where applicable (Supp. Table 2). To model the cage experiments, 150 female and 150 male wildtype adults (or 270 females and 270 males for 10% release) along with 150 female and 150 male heterozygotes (or 30 females and 30 males for 10% release) are initially present. Females may fail to mate, or mate once in their life, with a male of a given genotype according to its frequency in the male population, chosen randomly with replacement such that males may mate multiple times. The number of eggs produced from each mated female is randomly chosen by sampling with replacement from experimental values, and the eggs hatch or not with a probability that depends on the mother (Supp. Table 2). To start the next generation, 600 larvae are randomly selected, unless less than 600 larvae have hatched, in which case the smaller amount initiates the next generation, following experiment. The probability of subsequent survival to adulthood is assumed to be equal across genotypes. Assuming very large population sizes gives results for the genotype frequencies that are indistinguishable from the deterministic model. For the deterministic egg count, we use the large population limit of the stochastic model.
All calculations are carried out using Wolfram Mathematica [5].

Crop Case Study: GMO Golden Rice in Asia with Enhanced Vitamin A Benefits for Consumers
David Dawe

Golden Rice is genetically modified to provide beta-carotene in the rice grain and it could potentially address widespread Vita- min A deficiency in poor countries where rice is a staple. Politi- cal opponents have viewed Golden Rice as representing the interests of multi-nationals and as inherently unsafe for con- sumption. Progress has been made towards adapting this crop to tropical-rice growing environments, but it has not yet been introduced into farmer’s fields. Efficacy and safety have not yet been fully tested. Substantial work remains to target and deliver this intervention to Vitamin A-deficient populations, and to over- come remaining resistance to this technology. The political response to the on-going development of Golden Rice is reviewed to draw lessons for biofortification efforts that employ modern biotechnology. Within Asian countries, successful development and delivery will require policy dialogue among agriculturalists, health specialists, and advocates for the poor.
Key words: rice, biotechnology, Vitamin A deficiency.
A. In low-income populations where rice is the primary staple, several micronutrient deficiencies are chronic problems, including lack of Vitamin A. Such deficien- cies are particularly pronounced in small children, who need greater nutrient density in food to meet their higher nutrient needs. While the link between VAD and blind- ness captures public attention, VAD also lowers immune response and increases the death rate from common childhood diseases in developing countries, and as such VAD is often considered primarily in terms of child- hood-mortality effects.
VAD is widely recognized as a globally significant problem. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (2004, p. 4) estimates that “Vitamin A defi- ciency is compromising the immune systems of approx- imately 40% of the developing world’s under-fives and leading to the early deaths of an estimated one million young children each year.” VAD is often a problem where rice gruel is used as a weaning food. It is most important in the poorest nations of the world, including most of South and Southeast Asia where rice is the main staple, and that situation has not changed during the past decade.
The idea of using rice as a vehicle to address micro- nutrient deficiencies dates at least to the early 1980s. This idea emerged within the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) system and led to conventional breeding efforts to increase iron and zinc in rice in the 1990s. Creating rice with beta- carotene content was not possible until the advent of
 Introduction
Genetically modified rice that contains beta-carotene, widely known as Golden Rice (GR), has not yet been introduced in any country. It was developed to address Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in low-income rice con- sumers, but currently needs much more development and testing before it can be introduced into farmers’ fields. GR is the most famous biofortification effort undertaken with modern biotechnology, due to the ini- tial publicity (e.g., the cover of Time magazine on July 31, 2000). As such, it has been a lightening rod for the debate about the use of GMOs in meeting nutritional needs. Thus, for this special issue on GM foods and bio- fortification, a review of the lessons learned from the GR case is crucial to understanding the political land- scape for other biofortification efforts. GR shows both the dramatic nutritional benefits that can be achieved with use of modern biotechnology and the considerable hurdles to eventual adoption and impact.
Below, this article presents the story of GR, includ- ing a review of the controversies regarding its develop- ment and the literature estimating ex-ante benefits, risks, and costs. The article closes with an assessment of the current prospects for GR and lessons for other bio- fortification efforts.
Impetus, Development, and Initial Reactions
The polished rice grain does not contain beta-carotene, a Vitamin A precursor that the body converts into Vitamin

modern biotechnology techniques. The Rockefeller Foundation (RF) funded the initial GR research through its Rice Biotechnology Network, which was specifically established to address the need for basic biotechnology research on this important food crop that was likely to be ignored by the private sector in industrialized coun- tries. With support from the RF in the 1990s, Ingko Pot- rykus at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer at the University of Freiburg, Germany, col- laborated to introduce daffodil genes into rice. The sci- ence was complex and cutting edge at that time, as it was an early example of the use of pathway engineering. Their success was hailed as a significant breakthrough in the application of modern biotechnology, and the work appeared in Science (Ye et al., 2000).
In conjunction with scientific publication, Potrykus appeared on the cover of Time (July 31, 2000). Interest- ingly, the cover itself posed the debate that has dogged this idea from the beginning: “This rice could save a million kids a year, but protesters believe such geneti- cally modified foods are bad for us and our planet.” The article appeared at the height of the relatively new debate about the acceptance of GM foods, largely trig- gered by trade conflicts between exporting countries that had adopted the technology (the United States, Can- ada, and Argentina) and the importing countries (largely the European Union [EU] and other European nations).
Part of the publicity focused on the donation of intel- lectual property (IP) rights for the GR technology so that it could be further developed and adapted for intro- duction in the developing world. Apart from the patent held by Potrykus, several enabling technologies were also needed for further development. Potrykus formed a partnership with Zeneca (which later became Syngenta Seeds AS after its merger with Novartis), due to their history of work in carotenoids. Syngenta negotiated to put together a package of rights to be donated for humanitarian use, including patents held by Bayer AG, Monsanto Co., Orynova BV, and Zeneca Mogen BV. The condition for use of these patents include a) that seeds are developed for distribution to farmers in devel- oping countries earning less than $10,000 per year from farming and 2) that release only takes place in countries with adequate biosafety regulations. The donation of this package of IP rights for humanitarian purposes was advertised as a model for the future transfer of this tech- nology to developing countries.
Negative reactions to GR were immediate and in many cases quite emotional. The groups reacting included environmental advocacy groups already engaged in arguing against GM crops in general, as well

as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) engaged in nutrition and food-security issues in developing coun- tries. In Southeast Asia, such groups included Biodiver- sity and Community Rights Action (BIOTHAI) in Thailand, the Cambodian Center for Study and Devel- opment in Agriculture (CEDAC), the Development Research Communication and Services Centre (DRCSC) in India, GRAIN-MASIPAG (Farmer-Scien- tist Partnership for Development, Inc.) in the Philip- pines, and PAN-Indonesia and Policy Research for Development Alternatives (UBINIG) in Bangladesh (BIOTHAI et al., 2001). First-world opposition includes organizations opposed to GM technology, such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and Food First, as well as various groups in Europe (e.g., Institute for Sci- ence in Society in the United Kingdom). Nutrition inter- vention groups do not seem to have been as vocal in the debate.
Many of these reactions reworked long-standing concerns about Green Revolution technologies and the commercialization of smallholder agriculture and thus were not specific to GR. All of the opposing groups agree that VAD is an important problem but objected to GR either as an inappropriate or an ineffective solution. To summarize, the negative reactions were based on these points:
1. Malnutrition is a result of poverty and interventions already exist to address micronutrient deficiencies. Instead of developing GR, resources should be focused on poverty alleviation, sustainable farming, and proven strategies for nutrition intervention, such as supplementation and diet diversification through backyard or community gardens.
2. GM foods are inherently unsafe to human health and the environment. GR poses risks of these kinds and thus will not achieve its humanitarian goals.
3. Rice is directly consumed by the poor, and thus the poor would be “guinea pigs” for any human health impacts. Either GR will not provide enough Vita- min A to do any good or will provide too much, resulting in Vitamin A toxicity.
4. The IP arrangements are so convoluted that they do not preclude commercial abuse and do not represent a useful replicable model. The idea of “donation” is an anathema to those who object to commercial control of any agricultural IP.
5. GR is part of the continued use of “Green Revolu- tion” technologies that are unsustainable and harm- ful to the poor.
Dawe &amp; Unnevehr — Crop Case Study: GMO Golden Rice in Asia With Enhanced Vitamin A Benefits for Consumers

It is not this case study’s purpose to debate these points but rather to delineate issues that are under debate.
The virulence of the debate is surprising to someone who is agnostic on the subject. On the one hand, scien- tists, multi-national seed companies, and the CGIAR felt that they deserved credit for addressing a humanitar- ian issue head-on and for donating technology for bene- ficial use. Admittedly, multi-nationals were in need of positive publicity following the negative reactions to first-generation GM crops in Europe, and this was a strong motivation for their action on IP issues. But it does seem that scientists involved were surprised to have their motives questioned, as they genuinely believed in the positive humanitarian potential of this technology. On the other hand, those opposed to GM technology for ethical, environmental, or health con- cerns seem to have felt that this represented a commer- cial conspiracy to win over the public. They wanted to debunk this technology because it diverts attention from potential negative impacts to potential positive ones, thus changing the terms of the debate. They labeled it a “Trojan horse” for other biotechnology products in less- developed countries. For the NGOs involved in poverty alleviation, it represents competition for resources and influence. Thus, the debate has been quite hostile in that each side accuses the other of acting in bad faith.
Subsequent Evolution and Current Status
The public attention to this potential new technology reinforced for its advocates the need to address several issues in its development. It is perhaps unfortunate that the first scientific breakthrough generated so much attention when it remained fairly far removed from implementation. The initial strains of GR utilizing daf- fodil genes did not contain very much beta-carotene and might have had little impact on VAD in most Asian diets. This point was noted almost immediately by astute advocates for the opposition (e.g., Shiva, 2000). Later GR1 lines contain as much as 5 times more beta- carotene, although Dawe, Robertson, and Unnevehr (2002) found that even this level may not have much impact in some populations that are severely affected by VAD and for whom rice is not the only staple.
Subsequent research has utilized cereal genes rather than daffodil genes to generate much higher levels of beta-carotene in so-called GR2 lines (Paine et al., 2005). In these lines, the enzymatic activity in the PSY genes found within maize or rice is utilized to produce much higher levels of beta-carotene in the rice grain. The new levels of beta-carotene in GR2 lines are 20 times higher
AgBioForum, 10(3), 2007 | 156
than the original line, and these materials could provide all of the Vitamin A requirements for children eating rice-based diets (Stein, Sachdev, &amp; Qaim, 2006). This improvement in beta-carotene content brought forth a few restatements of the same general objections from those originally opposed to the technology (e.g., see Greenpeace, 2005).
The initial framework to donate GR technology for humanitarian purposes remains under the control of Pot- rykus and Beyer, who are advised by a Golden Rice Humanitarian Board (Golden Rice Humanitarian Project website). This Board does not make funding decisions. Much of the current funding for development comes from USAID grants to the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), as well as country-mission grants to National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS). Other funding sources include the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foun- dation, the Swiss Development and Collaboration Agency, the Syngenta Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.1 Research collaborators include IRRI, as well as NARS institutions in Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines, India, China, and Indonesia.
Field trials of the GR1 lines were conducted for the first time in 2004 at Louisiana State University (as US regulations allowed this step to move forward more quickly than in any Asian country). The first trials dem- onstrate that the crop is agronomically sound and may have higher beta-carotene when grown under field con- ditions. Limited field trials for the GR2 lines have also been carried out, but these GR1 and GR2 lines need to be crossed into appropriate indica varieties for use in Asia.
In Asia, research samples of the initial GR arrived at IRRI in 2001. Attempts were made to create new trans- genic variants of IR64, BR29, and other widely grown varieties in Asia with high levels of beta-carotene, using the same genes for beta-carotene synthesis. Breeding work (back-crossing) into leading Asian varieties was also undertaken with the initial GR lines. With the avail- ability of the new GR1 and GR2 lines with higher beta- carotene content, the activities with the initial lines were ended in 2003, and back-crossing work with the new lines began in 2004. As of yet, no field trials have been conducted in Asia, although such trials of backcrossed GR1 and GR2 lines may be conducted in the Philippines

in 2007 and are possible in India in 2008 (G. Barry, per- sonal communication, June 20, 2007). These countries have relatively well established biosafety guidelines, and have already approved other GM crops for commer- cial purposes.
Beyond issues of agronomic viability, there are other development efforts required to address issues of accep- tance, safety, and impact. Some taste tests have been carried out (Dubock, 2005), although not yet in Asia. Bioavailability testing is currently ongoing at Tufts Uni- versity, using GR2 lines (Stein, Sachdev, &amp; Qaim, 2007), and the next phase will be a study in Asia (G. Toenniessen, personal communication, August 1, 2006). Detailed work for biosafety risk assessment will con- tinue as the crop-development work advances. This risk assessment work will be mostly carried out in Asia by NARS and will take several years to complete.
Preliminary stability and retention studies are also underway in Germany, the United States, and the Philip- pines in order to take account of varying storage and cooking conditions in different socioeconomic and cul- tural settings. For example, exposure to air, light, and moisture during storage will vary across locations. As another example, rice is parboiled in Bangladesh before eating. Conditions and food preparation processes such as these could have large effects on the quantity of beta- carotene in the cooked grain, so the results of these stud- ies will be critical for making a better assessment of the potential contribution of GR to alleviating VAD. More work of this kind will need to be done as more material adapted to local conditions is developed.
An Ex-Ante Analysis of Benefits, Costs, and Risks
As discussed above, the importance of VAD is widely recognized. Its persistence is testimony to the limita- tions of current interventions (discussed more fully in other papers in this special issue). GR has the potential to reach important subpopulations that have not been targeted by current interventions, most notably small children in parts of rural Asia where rice is the predomi- nant staple and weaning food. Several different studies have now tried to assess the potential benefits of GR using different economic methods and building their analyses on some strong assumptions about nutritional benefits. Because GR is still so far from actual produc- tion and consumption, little is known about bioavailabil- ity, losses in storage or cooking, or many other factors that would influence the actual delivery of Vitamin A.
AgBioForum, 10(3), 2007 | 157
These studies are beginning and will help define the deployment options for the product.
Costs of development will include basic research, adaptation to local conditions, biosafety testing, and costs of consumer and producer education, as well as any specific marketing regulations and future mainte- nance breeding. In 2002, Dawe et al. made very crude estimates of GR costs for Asia, which now appear to have underestimated the costs of development and pro- motion. Stein’s (2006) estimates of the costs for bring- ing GR to market in India are $21-28 million total for the next 30 years (discounted to the present), or $0.7-0.9 million annually. This includes costs of development within India of $4.1-8.7 million, $2.2-2.5 million for regulatory review, and $15.6-30.7 million for promotion and marketing. These estimates show that significant investments must still be made to bring GR to farmers’ fields in Asia, above and beyond international research and development (R&amp;D) to support understanding of bioavailability and biosafety.
Every ex-ante study has shown benefits from GR, and these are usually substantial and cost-effective. Dawe et al. (2002) found that the initial GR strain would deliver very modest amounts of Vitamin A in the diets of VAD children in one area of the Philippines. They also estimated that the initial GR was very cost-effective compared with other interventions, such as wheat forti- fication or supplementation. Zimmermann and Qaim (2004) estimated the benefits in terms of saved disabil- ity-adjusted life years (DALYs), and found potential reductions in annual health-related costs of $16-88 mil- lion in the Philippines. Anderson, Jackson, and Nielsen (2004) used their results to estimate benefits of better health for unskilled workers in a general equilibrium framework and found that health benefits potentially dwarf any agricultural productivity benefits from GM rice, maize, and oilseed crops in Asia.
The most recent study is by Stein (2006) for India, and it finds that the newer GR would reduce the burden of VAD in India by 5-54%, depending upon assump- tions about adoption and who consumes it. The cost-per- DALY-saved would be $3.40-35.47 for GR, which com- pares favorably with alternative interventions. However, these costs-per-DALY-saved for GR are significantly higher than equivalent costs for biofortification of rice or wheat with either iron or zinc. The latter biofortifica- tions are easier to achieve and to promote, as they involve less complex breeding applications and fewer consumer-acceptance issues. The Stein (2006) study confirms that major benefits are possible from GR, but also that it may be a more challenging biofortification

application than other potential biofortification interven- tions.
What are the risks for supporters of GR? One risk that seems minimal at this stage is that NGOs will be able to derail field testing on a large scale. Several coun- tries in Asia (including the Philippines and India) have already approved GM crops for commercial purposes, and there are procedures for such approval in many countries. If the data support the effectiveness and safety of the new crops, it seems politically likely that field testing will proceed. However, exporting countries like Thailand and Vietnam are cautious about GM con- tent that might reduce export prospects. GR at least pro- vides a visible marker (golden color) that would facilitate market segmentation.
However, NGOs may have more influence on adop- tion by farmers and consumers than on field testing. Many large NGOs are likely to support GR if it is safe and effective, e.g., the influential NGOs in Bangladesh such as Grameen, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), and Proshika. These NGOs are unlikely to take a major lead in promoting GR, but they will probably not oppose it and may lend some support to its dissemination if there is strong evidence it will help the poor. But many other NGOs advocate organic farming, and it seems unlikely that any amount of evi- dence will convince them to support GR: their objec- tions are due to ethical or ideological considerations, not scientific skepticism. Their influence is not to be ignored, and if GR is to be adopted, educational cam- paigns targeted to farmers and the general public will be of crucial importance.
There are several other risks that could be important. First, after substantial investment, GR may not be widely adopted and will have little semblance of the impact envisioned. Farmers who wish to sell it in mar- kets (most rice in Asia is traded in markets, not con- sumed at home) may not want to take the risks of adopting a new variety (e.g., lower yield, susceptibility to pests and diseases) unless they are compensated with higher prices or yields. However, such higher prices would work against its incorporation into the diets of the poor, possibly causing it to wind up as a niche product for rich consumers. One possibility to counter these incentives would be to bundle the increased beta-caro- tene content with other new desirable traits that farmers find helpful. Alternatively, GR could be grown by poor farmers for their own consumption, although again they may be discouraged by the risks noted above. Further- more, this strategy would limit the potential impact of GR because the poorest of the poor typically buy much
AgBioForum, 10(3), 2007 | 158
of their rice on markets. Yet another possibility would be for governments to subsidize the production and/or consumption of GR through public distribution systems to encourage adoption by farmers and consumption by poor consumers. However, it should be noted that tar- geted government subsidies in agriculture and food are difficult to deliver without substantial leakage of finan- cial resources.
Second, GR may cause unforeseen health risks, par- ticularly if it is the first GMO to be widely consumed by children. This speaks to the importance of extensive testing to ensure that GR has limited side effects and, after storage and cooking, has enough bioavailable beta- carotene to substantially reduce VAD. The lengthy approval process still underway for commercialization of Bt rice in China shows the concerns that governments have over GM food crops (as opposed to Bt maize intended for animal feed or Bt cotton). These issues are discussed more fully in the China and Philippines case studies elsewhere in this special issue. If Bt rice is approved in China, this will most likely smooth the path for approval of GR—certainly in China and possibly in other countries as well.
Third, GR may be adopted and have a positive impact, but one that is difficult to perceive or measure, so that little “credit” is given to the innovation. To rem- edy this situation, it will be important to undertake edu- cation campaigns to inform any skeptical farmers, consumers, or NGOs about the nutritional benefits of GR (assuming a successful variety is developed) and its benefits for farmers. Such campaigns will be important for ensuring widespread adoption as well as giving due credit once it is adopted.
Many members of the educated general public in Asia are convinced that most new technologies hurt farmers, especially if the corporate sector is involved in the technology. To some extent, this is a legacy of the Green Revolution, which is still viewed with skepticism by many even though it increased productivity, has been adopted widely by farmers, and was a major force in averting the widespread famines forecast by many observers. As a specific example, many people assume that because of the corporate sector’s involvement in the origins of GR, farmers will need to purchase this seed every year. While this is true for many crops in devel- oped economies, no company at present has plans to commercialize GR in developing countries. In addition, the technology to create GR was donated by its inven- tors and private companies holding intellectual property licenses so that any organization or farmer can freely distribute or replant seed. Thus, farmers will be under
Dawe &amp; Unnevehr — Crop Case Study: GMO Golden Rice in Asia With Enhanced Vitamin A Benefits for Consumers

no compulsion to buy new seeds every year, but this fact will need to be clearly and creatively communicated to the public. The public may also need to be convinced that a reasonable share of benefits from adoption of GR goes to farmers. Economists typically assume that adop- tion by farmers is prima facie evidence that it provides them benefits, but this line of reasoning is not necessar- ily convincing to others.
Future Potential and Lessons for Other Biofortification Efforts
GR technology still needs considerable research invest- ment to be viable in farmers’ fields and to meet a rigor- ous standard for consumer safety. Moving past regulatory hurdles will not be easy, and thus, this crop is unlikely to play a role in meeting micronutrient needs before the next decade.
From the political standpoint, there are still no advo- cates for this technology within Asian countries. Minis- tries of Agriculture and NARS are production-oriented by training and mandate; thus, they have little interest in a project that diverts attention from production goals and requires innovative cooperation with nutritional sci- ence. The IP arrangements have not given participating NARS a sense of ownership or control of this technol- ogy. Ministries of Health may find that biofortification poses a threat to their traditional programs, although it can potentially save lives and government expenditures in the long run. NGOs have yet to embrace this technol- ogy.
To move forward, it seems clear that GR must be agronomically viable at a minimum. To be acceptable to consumers and accomplish its nutritional goals will require that countries make some strategic decisions about implementation, adoption, and promotion. Such decisions include desirable beta-carotene levels, target populations, desirable agronomic characteristics, and methods for distribution and promotion. These choices would be best informed if the health and agricultural policy-makers can agree on the need for and potential benefits from this technology and if NGOs who work with the poor embrace it. As this approach to biofortifi- cation is relatively challenging, future investments in research need to increasingly be driven by policy dia- logue.
The GR story provides guidance for other biofortifi- cation efforts. First, any biofortification of a staple crop using GM technology will likely encounter greater political resistance, as well as more challenges in safety assessments and delivery, than non-GM approaches.
AgBioForum, 10(3), 2007 | 159
Second, any biofortification effort will need support and guidance from NARS and NGOs within countries with nutritionally deficient populations in order to be designed and targeted appropriately. These lessons for future strategy are explored further in the final article in this special issue.

            <Text>  Ever since the Asilomar Conference on ‘Recombinant DNA’ in February 1975, regulatory policies relating to recom- binant DNA technology have focused on the idea that this technology implies threats to human health and the environment [1]. As a consequence, the explicit goal of these policies is to protect society and nature from an assumed hazard, or, if protection is not possible, at least to delay the imple- mentation of the technology until scientific evidence shows it to be harmless. These pol- icies were widely accepted at the time, as public concerns were, and still are, impor- tant. As time has gone by, the evidence for negative impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops has become weaker. However, the regulatory policies within the EU are still rigid enough to prevent most GM crops from leaving the confined laboratory set- ting; should some candidate occasionally overcome the hurdles posed by these poli- cies, the precautionary principle is invoked in order to ensure further delaying in its use in the field. The reason for this over-cautious approach is widespread public resistance to GM crops, caused and amplified by inter- ested groups that are opposed to the tech- nology and invest heavily into lobbying against it.
As time has gone by, the evidence for negative impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops has become weaker
Against this background of political resistance, it is no surprise that the risks, costs and potential disadvantages of not growing GM crops have received little or no attention. These disadvantages become increasingly relevant as the scientific argu- ments for the prevailing resistance to GM
crops become weaker. Twenty-five years of risk research on GM crops have established beyond reasonable doubt that biotechnol- ogy is not per se riskier than conventional plant breeding technologies [2]. The whole seemingly endless discussion about pur- ported risks of GM crops is akin to the famous Monty Python sketch in which John Cleese is trying to return a dead parrot to shopkeeper Michael Palin, who, despite the evidence, insists that the bird is well, alive and “pining for the fjords”. Instead, we need to highlight the opportunities missed by not accepting GM crops. These include lost rev- enues for farmers, breeding companies and consumers, brain drain and lost technology innovations, reduced agricultural product- ivity and sustainability, foregone health ben- efits, especially reducing malnutrition, and many more realized or expected virtues of GM crops [3].
intended for human food and animal feed. Any party seeking approval for an edible GM crop must provide extensive scientific documentation that demonstrates that the food or feed derived thereof has no adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment, does not mislead the con- sumer, or does not differ from the food it is intended to replace to such an extent that its normal consumption would be nutritionally disadvantageous for the consumer.
In a report from 2010,
the EC [...]concluded that biotechnology is not per se riskier than conventional plant breeding technologies
The risk assessment is conducted and compiled by the applicant, and is evalu- ated by the GMO Panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The opinion ofthepanelshouldformthescientificbasis when member states provide other legiti- mate arguments and cast their votes in the Standing Committee for Food and Animal Health of the European Commission. Thus, the decision to approve a particular GMO should be on the basis of scientific grounds. By the same logic, one might take for granted that only GMOs that have been shown to have adverse effects on animal or human health or the environment will not receive approval. In practice, however, the decision whether or not to approve a par- ticular GMO is not solely a scientific issue. Several member states vote, in principle, against approval, irrespective of the sci- entific opinion delivered by the EFSA [5]. In recognition of this dead-lock, the European Commission (EC) has suggested that individual member states should have

tionally accepted guidelines, developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (www.fao.org). One leading principle is the concept of substantial equivalence, which stipulates that any new GM variety should be assessed for its safety by compar- ing it with an equivalent, conventionally bred variety that has an established his- tory of safe use [4]. Despite the fact that the Codex Alimentarius guidelines are glob- ally endorsed, the authorization procedure for GMOs differs substantially between national jurisdictions. Europe stands out as being considerably more restrictive than countries in North and South America and parts of Asia, for example. Within the European Union (EU), a common regula- tory legal framework such as Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003, governs GM crops

 the right to restrict cultivation of a given GM crop even if there are no scientifically established risks, that is, to adopt restric- tions on the basis of socio-economical or ethical grounds [6].
... it is time to look at the other side of the equation and gauge the possible benefits of adopting and growing GM crops
In addition to the scientific documenta- tion provided by the applicants who seek approval of a GM crop, public research has investigated the risks of GMOs during the past 15 years. The Directorate-General Research under the EC has spent €200 million during the past decade on such research, and several member states have initiated national research programmes specifically targeting the potential impact of the very same crops and traits that are in the European approval system [2]. A col- laborative working group under the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR) has estimated that the funds allocated to national risk research on GMOs in 13 European countries amount to at least €120 million during the past eight years (http://bmg.gv.at/home/Schwerpunkte/ Gentechnik/Fachinformation_Allgemeines/ SCAR_Collaborative_Working_Group _Risk_Research_on_GMOs).
In a report from 2010, the EC summarized the results of 130 research projects involv- ing more than 500 independent research groups and concluded that biotechnology is not per se riskier than conventional plant breeding technologies [2]. Further support for this position comes from the UK Farm-Scale Evaluation (FSE), which studied the potential impact of herbicide-tolerant crops on farm- land biodiversity [7]. One insight from the study is that overall changes in agricultural management determine the impact of a crop on biodiversity, rather than the technology or breeding behind the crop itself [8]. Between 2008 and 2009, the EFSA GMO panel evaluated a renewal to permit the con- tinued import, processing and cultivation of maize variety MON810 for food and feed. MON810 expresses the Cry1Ab pro- tein from the soil-borne bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which confers resistance to the European corn borer, and is one of two GM crops approved for cultivation in Europe; it was first approved in 1998. As a
basis for its 2009 opinion, the EFSA GMO Panel summarized 48 peer-reviewed papers on the potential risks of MON810 on animal and human health and the environment, in addition to the documentation provided by the company [9]. It found no adverse effects and concluded that MON810 is compar- able with its conventionally bred parental lines. The only difference reported was that MON810 has an increased variability in lignin content, in some studies it has been found to be higher and in some studies lower. Similarly, a review by Icoz &amp; Stotzky [10] of studies on the effects of insect-resistant Bt crops on soil ecosystems found no notable detrimental effects on microbes and other organisms in below-ground soil ecosystems. Accordingly, the authors concluded that “...available funding would be better spent on studies of the potential risks associated with the release of trans- genic plants genetically engineered to express pharmaceutical and industrial prod- ucts that, in contrast to Cry proteins, are tar- geted primarily to human beings and other higher eukaryotic organisms.”
on seeds would increase from €180 to €210 per hectare, but the cost of herbicides would decrease from €180 to €55. Taken together, the cost of input goods would decrease by 27%.
Analysis of the sugar beet shows that the economic value to producers and, by extension, to society is strategically depend- ent on two factors: the cost of keeping GM sugar separate from conventional sugar, and the public acceptance of GM sugar. The cru- cial limit was found to be a separation cost of 25% of the price; at this limit, the economic value to society vanishes even if all consum- ers buy GM products—if public acceptance is 100%. In a realistic scenario the separa- tion cost is 10% of the price and the public acceptance is 25% of the consumers. Thus, the economic benefit would be €1.3 mil- lion, or 2% of the total value of sugar beet production. If GM crops enjoyed full public acceptance, and if there were accordingly no costs of separation, the economic gain to society would amount to €10 million; about 14% of the total value of sugar beet production. Approximately 3,000 hectares of arable land—8% of the acreage of sugar beet—would be available for other uses.
... not adopting modern breeding tools—including biotechnology— will probably hamper the European agricultural systems facing a warmer and more variable climate
Similar values apply for potato and can- ola, so introducing these three GM crops in Sweden would yield an economic value of €30 million annually. In addition, producers would regain 10,000 hectares (ha) of ara- ble land; using official statistics on leasing costs for arable land in Sweden, this has an annual value of approximately €2 million. This adds up to a combined annual value to society of €32 million. The accumulated value of this annual revenue over many years—the so-called capitalized value—is €1–€1.6 billion at an interest rate of 2–3%. The annual gain amounts to approximately 14, 11 and 5% of the production value for sugar beet, canola and potato, respectively. EU-wide, a shift to these three GM crops would yield a gain of €2 billion annually, and would save 645,000 ha, which corre- sponds to a capitalized value in the range of €80–€120 billion.

 environment than conventionally bred varie- ties, it is time to look at the other side of the equation and gauge the possible benefits of adopting and growing GM crops. To that end, Fagerström &amp; Wibe [11] analysed the poten- tial economic consequences for Sweden of farmers not growing GM crops—herbicide- tolerant sugar beet and canola, and late blight-resistant potato—and then extended the analysis to all of the EU. They considered two rough categories of impact: effects that could be evaluated by studying market prices that show impacts for producers on work- force and capital, and demand for fertilizers, pesticides and fuel, and factors related to the cost of keeping GM crops separated from conventionally or organically grown crops during cultivation, harvest, transport, storage and processing. The latter cost arises from the European attitude of regarding GM crops and products as contaminants—as if we were dealing with toxic substances.
In 2008, Sweden produced almost 2 million tons of sugar beet grown on approximately 37,000 hectares and with a production value of €70 million. The authors calculated that a shift to herbicide- tolerant sugar beet could have led to a 5–10% increase in yield. Expenditure

  These calculations presuppose full public acceptance of GM crops; that is, a world in which consumers per- ceive GM crops as equal to or better than non-GM varieties. In addition, the results rest on the assumption that the benefits to the environment such as decreased use of pesticides can be measured by the cost of the pesticides. Presumably, this is an under- estimate of the environmental benefits, and the societal value is therefore probably greater than the figures presented above.
Other studies address the problem of missed economic benefits, often using economic models similar to those used by Fagerström &amp; Wibe [11]. Generally, they confirm the results discussed above: the magnitudes of the unrealized benefits are similar. Matin Qaim, an agricultural econ- omist at Göttingen University, Germany, for example, presented figures for Bt cot- ton adoption that would entail global wel- fare gains in the range of €0.5–€1.0 billion per year [12]. The biggest impact occurs in China, but India, where the relevant tech- nology was more recently commercialized, has been catching up rapidly. It is estimated
that the widespread adoption of Bt cotton in India and other countries of South Asia will result in further regional welfare gains on the order of €1 billion per year.
The benefits of adopting GM oilseeds and maize are amplified by the larger inter- national markets on which they are traded. While the annual global welfare gains at the present moderate level of adoption are esti- mated at €3.5 billion [13], this figure could reach approximately €7.5 billion with wide- spread international adoption of herbicide- tolerance and insect-resistant crops [12]. However, it is also noted that a ban on pro- duction and imports by the EU could reduce these global gains by two-thirds owing to unrealized benefits for domestic consumers and the far-reaching influence of EU policies on international trade flows and production decisions in other regions.
Large global welfare gains are projected for GM rice as well. Assuming that there is moderate adoption of GM rice in rice- producing regions, the combined global welfare gains are estimated to be in the region of €5 billion per year for Bt-carrying, herbicide-resistant and drought-tolerant
rice varieties, with India and China gaining the most. Projected welfare gains in China alone could reach more than €3 billion when first-generation GM rice technologies are widely adopted. Both studies [11,12] highlight that available analyses probably provide lower estimates of the global wel- fare effects of GM crops, because other environmental and health benefits have not been properly quantified.

griculture is blamed frequently for biodiversity loss. Several recent stud-
design of the agricultural landscape, with refuges for non-crop species, intercrop- ping and crop rotation, can counterbalance the effects of an intensified agriculture sys- tem [14]. Hence, one of the most important consequences of better yields from herbi- cide and pest-resistant GM crops in Europe would be that the surplus land could be used for refuges to promote biodiversity in the farming landscape and save natural forests from deforestation or wetlands from being drained to make way for farmland. However, regulations regarding cultivation

 distances, as well as other measures to keep GM crops separate from conventionally bred varieties, lock GM crops into large- scale agricultural practices and, in effect, prevent intercropping. Thus, the principle of non-coexistence limits the scope for farmers to take full advantage of the benefits of pre- sent and future GM crops to further reduce the need for pesticides and increase the productivity of farmland. This line of rea- soning is supported by a recent study show- ing that the willingness of farmers to adopt GM crops is substantially hampered by the costs and uncertainties associated with coexistence regulations, despite lower costs for chemicals [15].
Historically, cereal crop varieties have been replaced by new varieties on average every 5–10 years [16]. The reasons for this turnover vary, but one under- lying drive for crop replacement is the rapid loss of resistance traits. In order to maintain yield levels, farmers must either increase their use of chemicals to kill pests, or change to a new crop variety; hence the continu- ousbreedingforresistancetraits.Imminent climate changes will put further constraints on agricultural production, including an increasing need for faster and more effi- cient plant breeding to adapt crops to more variable local conditions [17]. If breeders fail in this regard, agro-chemical use will increase and Europe will become more dependent on imports. In Europe, the spatial variation in rainfall is expected to increase: Northern Europe can expect a more humid climate, which will constrain crop produc- tion owing to the increased severity of biotic stresses such as insect pests, fungal patho- gens and the invasion of alien, noxious spe- cies, whereas crop production in southern Europe will have to be adapted to drier con- ditions [18,19]. Thus, not adopting modern breeding tools—including biotechnology— will probably hamper the European agri- cultural systems facing a warmer and more variable climate [20].
Legislation that determines what consti- tutes a GMO was ratified in 2001. In a legal sense, a GMO is defined as an organism in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating or natural recombination, and refers to both plants and animals, except humans. In practice, a GMO is defined by an adden- dum to the Directive 2001/18EC, which lists the techniques that give rise to a GMO. Since the Directive 2001/18EC was ratified,
ten years have passed, and technology has progressed further. Many of the techniques listed in the addendum have been improved or are obsolete. A recent report to the EC by the Joint Research Centre [21] describes new methods, their possible applications for plant breeding and potential implications for agriculture. One common aspect of the new techniques is that many involve the use of recombinant DNA or RNA molecules in one phase of the breeding process; however, these recombinant molecules are not pre- sent in the final product and are commonly not transmitted to the next generation.
... the burden of EU legislation for GM technologies is completely out of proportion compared with other science-based endeavours
Interestingly, European scientists at public and private institutions are at the forefront of technological development concerning new breeding. In this respect the situation is similar to the history of plant transformation technologies first devel- oped at European universities [22], but now mainly used outside Europe [23]. By way of illustration, BASF, the company that developed the Amflora potato, announced recently that it is halting research on GM crops in Europe. Ultimately, the develop- ment and success of scientific know-how and new technology in Europe, as well as the adoption of new techniques and crops, will depend on the decisions made by European legislators who are discussing GM technologies and their ratification.
As a comparison, other genetically engineered products, such as biopharma- ceuticals, are approved for humans and food-producing animals after ordinary science-based safety assessments [23], without the ideological stigmatization and biased decision-making processes seen for GM crops.
USA, Canada or Brazil (27 months) [24]. In addition, these European approval times are only valid for importing commodities; approvals for cultivation in Europe take substantially longer. It took 14 years for the Amflora potato, for example, which is only the second GM crop to be approved in Europe. Not only are rules more restrictive in Europe, but only the largest companies in the seed and plant breeding business have the financial capacity to go through the lengthy and costly procedure required for approving a GM crop variety. This hampers small and medium business and prevents business spin-offs from plant research.
Second, research priorities in regard to the environmental impacts of agriculture are not directed in a productive way; risk research in Europe is not helping to develop sustainable agriculture for the future. The paradigm that stipulates that biotechnology is inherently risky, and singles out one plant breeding technology as the basis for risk research, is putting a massive regulatory bur- den on a technology that could enhance sus- tainability. As a consequence, any future risk researchonGMOsinEuropeshouldaddress the costs of this burden and the risks of not using biotechnology. We conclude that the research programmes set up in the EU to address the potential risks of GM crops are no longer scientifically motivated inquiries. The scientific community has already settled the relevant questions regarding potential risks associated with GM crops approved under legislation; what is going on is a politi- cal game. In this game, the so-called precau- tionary principle is used, in absurdum, to delay any launch of a GM crop far beyond the limit of reasonable scientific doubts.
Third, it is time to acknowledge the dis- tinct imbalance with respect to the costs and benefits of GM crops: lobbyists who benefit from demonizing GM crops are not the ones who have to carry the costs. Hence, it is not the hyped risks of GM crops that are a problem in the EU, it is the sub- missive attitude of politicians and policy- makers towards organizations who insist that GM crops are risky. It is then ordinary consumers who pay the costs and do not receive the benefits. This submissiveness manifests in the prevailing policy that GM products should be kept separate from non- GM products, as well as the incessant calls for regulations about labelling and tracea- bility. As shown above, the potential benefit to the European economy from adopting GM crops is substantial. But these potential

... research priorities in regard to the environmental impacts of agriculture are not directed in a productive way...
Risk research on GM crops in Europe has to come to an end, as do futile battles about disasters that will not happen. A dead par- rot is a dead parrot, both in Monty Python sketches and in science. The way to sustain- able and productive agriculture is not by maintaining expensive, parallel production systems, using different sets of crop varie- ties, and relying on expensive regulations for their coexistence. Instead, agricultural systems should use the best available tech- nology at all stages, including plant breed- ing. It is clear that the approval and decision process within the EU for GM crops is not science-based. The risk assessment and approval process, where the outcome is dominated by the opinions of a few self- interested stakeholder organizations with special interests is unique. It is alarming that decision-making bodies kow-tow to this non-science-based paradigm.

Introduction
Genome editing of livestock is advancing rapidly as a technical field and may be poised to become com- mercial reality. Yet questions remain as to appropriate regulation, potential impact on the industry sector and public acceptability of products. This paper examines some of the complexity and ambiguity in incorporat- ing genome edited animals into a food production system. It takes as its starting point the commercial introduction of genetically modified crops, and some of the issues raised by early applications of genetic modification to crops.
The commercial introduction of genetically mod- ified (GM) crops in the early 1990s was initially fairly uncontroversial. The widespread introduction in maize, soya and oilseed rape, however, resulted in social campaigns against GM crops in Europe and elsewhere. Nevertheless, annual surveys from ISAAA (2015) indicate widespread adoption of a limited number of modified crops species (mostly oilseed rape, soya and maize) and a limited number of traits (mostly herbicide tolerance and insect resistance). The research pipeline continues to offer novel crop appli- cations (Parisi et al. 2016), although their penetration into practical use has been slow to date. In contrast, there are no genetically modified (GM) food animals

 being sold for food at the time of writing, to my knowledge.
Several recent developments look set to change this picture. The advent of genome editing techniques, especially CRISPR-Cas9, is enabling changes to be made at the DNA level, much more easily, precisely and cheaply. The recent approvals of genetically modified salmon for consumption both by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015), and Health Canada (2016) provide evidence that it is possible for GM products to satisfy regulatory requirements. In addition, cheaper and faster DNA sequencing is leading to increased understanding of the underlying genetic basis of traits. Together these developments potentially open up new opportunities for mar- ketable genetic modification in food animal produc- tion traits, hitherto unachievable.
Technological advances on their own are insuffi- cient for market penetration, however. An entire production system is involved, encompassing breed- ers, producers, different markets, retailers and con- sumers as well as regulators, animal welfare advocates, veterinarians and other pertinent stake- holders. And, most critically, products have to be acceptable to publics. A livestock production system thus consists of multiple stakeholders, each adapting to shifting circumstances and opportunities in differ- ent ways, but interacting with each other, and affecting each other. These stakeholders each respond to scientific developments, adjustments in markets, changes in methods of production, and economic and social pressures, in their own ways. The result is a kaleidoscope of multiple complex interactions. This paper explores some of this complexity and implica- tions of adoption of genome edited livestock. It does this in the context of early developments in GM crops and their regulation.
This paper draws on long-term observation of developments in genetics and livestock (e.g. Bruce and Bruce 1998), including scientific developments, regulatory changes, ethical and social challenges and industry action. Evidence is based on publications (including grey literature) and attendance at scientific, regulatory and industry meetings, as well as formal and informal conversations with individual stakehold- ers in livestock production systems. Rapidly develop- ing new technologies are offering novel possibilities that could be attractive to the livestock production sector, making an investigation of this subject timely.
This paper seeks to extend the recent focus of publications on regulation of genome edited livestock to a more systems-oriented approach, and suggests that further investigation of interactions among the stakeholders involved in livestock production is therefore important.
This exploration of complexity starts with a review of the current possible applications of genome editing to livestock, based on publicly available data. It shows how choices made by scientists regarding applications to be developed have responded to criticisms of the early developments in GM crops. Having established what kind of genome edited products might be in the pipeline, the next question considered is how these developments relate to some of the key issues which could affect their acceptance. These include argu- ments around naturalness, transgenesis and regulation that were raised by GM crops. Here I reflect on both the similarities and differences between genetic mod- ification and genome editing. Regulation will also affect the relative competitiveness of different types of companies; who might be the winners and who the losers? The introduction of genome editing will impact on other sectors of the livestock production system. I will focus particularly on interactions with veterinarians, given that many applications of genome editing currently relate to disease resistance. Finally, I reflect on the broader challenges to livestock produc- tion and how genome editing relates to these chal- lenges. The perspective will be European, and more specifically from the UK.
Possibilities of genome edited animals
Animals produced by genome editing offer the promise of precision modification to DNA, which older methods also offered, but in some respects failed to deliver. New precision engineering of the genome (Fahrenkrug et al. 2010) is in contrast to the traditional GM methods that largely relied on transfer of genes between species (Clark and Whitelaw 2003). Early enthusiasm at the prospects from GM animals (e.g. Bulfield 1990) dissipated as producing commercial GM animals proved to be more challenging than seemed at first. A number of developments in molec- ular biology have taken place over the last 15 year, including gene manipulation, methods of introducing genetic changes into animals, and understanding the
123

387
 underlying genetics (Bruce et al. 2013; Laible et al. 2015; Tan et al. 2016). In particular, the introduction of genome editing tools have revitalised the research area.
Genome editing involves the use of molecular ‘scissors’ to introduce changes into existing DNA, as opposed to classical genetic modification which often involved moving genes from one species to another. Genome editing also enables a much wider-range of changes, for example, gene knock-out, base pair substitution, targeted insertion/deletion of larger genomic regions, and modulation of gene expression (e.g. Tan et al. 2016; Van Eenennaam 2017).
Social pressures to produce real benefits
In selecting which applications to focus on, many of the developers of genome edited animals have sought to learn from the controversies surrounding GM crops, as well as welfare and ethical issues particular to animals. Some early research applications of GM to animals had also been subject to considerable scrutiny regarding both animal welfare and the ethical accept- ability of the procedures. Technology that was already controversial in a crop context is perceived as even more problematic when applied to sentient organisms, such as farmed livestock (Coles et al. 2015). One of the lessons taken by developers of genome edited animals is that applications with an animal welfare benefit would be expected to be much more acceptable to publics than livestock with production advantages. This is reflected in some of the early applications of genome editing to livestock.
One of the early applications of genome editing is to produce cows without horns (Recombinetics 2016). Dairy cows with horns can harm each other and their caretakers. Therefore it is common practice within the industry to remove the horns from calves by chemical or other means. This removal of horns is an unpleasant procedure, which it would be beneficial to avoid. Cows without horns (known as ‘polled’) exist natu- rally, but they tend to be beef cattle with much poorer milking ability. Using selective breeding to increase the incidence of the polled gene variant (allele) in the dairy herd would involve a very long process, particularly if milk yield was maintained at the same time. However, this gene variant has been introduced into dairy cows directly using genome editing (Re- combinetics 2016). The question remains whether
publics and animal welfare advocates perceive the animal welfare benefit to be of sufficient magnitude to justify such a biotechnological intervention. Whereas people working directly with dairy cattle will be aware of the processes involved in dehorning, and the benefits of not having to do so, most publics are likely to be unaware that dehorning processes take place, let alone what these involve in practice. The advan- tages of polled dairy cattle will not be immediately obvious to those not versed in agricultural practice, and the need for dehorning may be considered shocking.
Increased disease resistance is another area that has been addressed by genome editing, again with per- ceived animal welfare benefits. Examples include pigs tolerant to a fatal pig disease African Swine Fever (Lillico et al. 2013) and pigs resistance to a serious respiratory and reproductive disease, Porcine Repro- ductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) (Whit- worth et al. 2016). PRRS is an endemic pig disease in numerous countries and has few treatment possibili- ties. It negatively affects animal welfare and causes large economic losses. African Swine Fever is a pig disease endemic in Africa that causes up to 100% mortality and for which effective treatments and vaccines are not available. The disease has spread to Russia, and most recently to Eastern Europe, where it is seen as a threat to Western European pig production. Warthogs are found to be tolerant to African Swine Fever and inspired a genome editing method which has introduced the same tolerance alleles into domes- ticated pigs in an experimental setting (Lillico et al. 2013).
The benefits of other applications of genome editing may be perceived as more ambivalent. Genome editing has been used to produce more muscular animals in a variety of species, including pigs, cattle and sheep, by introducing a change in the myostatin gene (Cyranoski 2015; Proudfoot et al. 2015). The same change is naturally present in some breeds of cattle. In the public mind, muscular appear- ance often has connotations of poor welfare. Belgian Blue cattle and Pietrain pigs are two breeds that are muscular in appearance and of concern to animal welfare advocates. Belgian Blue cattle have a high incidence of problems when calving, and muscular breeds of pigs have been associated with high mortality rates. The causal mutation is in the myostatin gene in Belgian Blue cattle and the ryanodine
123

388
receptor/halothane gene in the Pietrain pig. The question arises whether animal welfare advocates are likely to be concerned by physical appearance, the specific genetic change, both, or neither? The exper- imental introduction reported by Proudfoot et al. (2015) was in the context of very poorly muscled cattle breeds, the resulting offspring physically appearing normal rather than excessively muscled. The myo- statin mutation also appears naturally in other breeds such as Highland cattle, without apparent associated welfare problems, so it may be possible to make the case that editing the myostatin gene provides a benefit in specific circumstances. However, the benefit is for production rather than animal welfare. It is less easy to see how a strong case can be made for more muscled pigs if muscling in pigs is associated with poor welfare (even when caused by a different genetic change). Public perceptions associating muscled animals with poor animal welfare can be difficult to shift and applications resulting in increased muscling may therefore prove to be controversial.
As is common with novel technologies, early innovations frequently use material which is readily available, such as already known gene variants. It seems likely that increasingly innovative genome edits will be developed. Suggestions in the scientific literature include: producing offspring of a single sex (e.g. for milk or egg production) (Fan et al. 2013; Tan et al. 2013), improved welfare by avoiding castration (Tan et al. 2013), and the prevention of the production of allergens and prion proteins in animals (Yao et al. 2014; Ni et al. 2014). Genome editing also has applications beyond the production of food animals, notably for research for understanding biological processes, in improved models of human diseases and potentially for production of animals for xenotransplantation. How- ever, medical applications will not be considered further in this paper.
Early applications of genome editing that come to public attention are likely to shape how people think about genome edited animals. These applications are likely to influence what people think genome edited animals are, and the purposes for which they have been developed. The choices made amongst possible applications of genome editing to animals are there- fore important. Benefits perceived by scientific or agricultural stakeholders, however, may be sometimes difficult to convey to lay people.
Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398 Is genome editing natural?
An important feature of GM crops is that they are viewed as unnatural by some people. The concept of naturalness is complex, and cannot be considered in detail in this article. However, as a recent report from the UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics (2015) indi- cates, naturalness should not be totally dismissed as an argument because most people recognise the concept as capturing something valid which should be taken into account. The question remains as to whether any breach of the natural order caused by genome editing would constitute a moral hazard.
Since all genome edited applications rely on laboratory intervention to develop parent animals, at some level, all involve a degree of human artifice. Bruce (2016), reflecting on whether genome editing is ‘unnatural’ or not from a moral reasoning perspective, suggests that it is important to consider the nature of the change brought about by genome editing. If selective breeding (genetic selection) is considered natural, and if the functional change brought about by genome editing could have been achieved by selective breeding, then it could be argued that there is little reason to object to genome editing in principle. An example is producing polled dairy cows. In this case, the same DNA sequence exists in nature and in the context of the same species. The question remains as to why it would be seen as natural to undertake selective breeding for a specific aim, but unnatural to do the same in a laboratory using genome editing.
Genome editing may produce changes that are not known to exist naturally in that species. But if these could reasonably have occurred naturally, even if they remained unrecognised by livestock breeders, it could be argued that these changes are also ‘natural’. The editing of resistance to PRRS into pigs might fit this category, as it is a mutational knock-out of gene function (Burkard et al. 2017).
It is easier to categorise as unnatural those appli- cations where the resulting animal is unlikely to have been achieved by normal mutation, for example producing offspring of a single sex. It is therefore possible to advance arguments that some genome edited animals are more unnatural than others. There is a similarity here with GM crops. It is possible to breed crop plants resistant to specific herbicides using traditional breeding methods, although the genetic basis for the resistance may vary between GM crops

 and non-GM crops. Equally, it is possible to produce novel applications by genetic modification, as exem- plified both in GM crops and GM animals. It is notable that the few current commercial applications of genetic modification to animals involve the pro- duction of pharmaceutical proteins (in milk or eggs). These traits are unnatural, yet have utility to humans. Clearly, just because something is considered unnat- ural, does not necessarily mean it is undesirable. Similarly, some natural mutations may be judged undesirable.
Although philosophers, theologians, ethicists and scientists may contest the various arguments as to what constitutes naturalness, lay publics may conceive of naturalness on a more intuitive basis. Such percep- tion of unnaturalness can be very difficult to argue against.
Is genome editing genetic modification?
The next lesson learned from experience with GM crops is the controversial nature of moving genes across species. An emphasis found in many scientific papers is that genome editing does not necessarily mean transgenic. Furthermore there is a tendency to equate transgenic with genetically modified. An example can be found in the report of genome editing for resistance to PRRS (Whitworth et al. 2016) which explicitly states that the resultant pigs are not trans- genic and therefore not genetically modified. This assertion is controversial, as the concept of what is genetic modification varies both legally and, more particularly, socially.
If the term ‘genetically modified’ is viewed as synonymous with ‘transgenic’, the implication is that since genome editing does not require the transfer of DNA from one species to another, then genome edited organisms, including livestock, are not genetically modified. This semantic difference may be attractive to proponents of genome edited animals, but it is unlikely to convince everyone, given the technology has developed in the context of genetic modification, and can be viewed as evolving from those techniques. The mere fact that genome editing comes from the same ‘stable’ as genetic modification can be sufficient to give it the same association.
On the other hand genome editing could also be viewed as distinct from genetic modification. Genome editing involves harnessing the cell’s natural repair
mechanisms to induce a specific change at a precise location in the genome. This type of change could have happened by natural mutation. Genome editing could therefore be viewed as ‘induced mutation’, with parallels to using radiation to induce mutations in plants (although the latter is of course, random, and would be unacceptable if applied to animals). How- ever, genome editing is not perfectly controlled due to ‘off-site’ effects, although recent research suggest that off-site effects can be controlled to a large extent (Tan et al. 2016) and gene sequencing could be used to detect presence or absence of off-site effects.
An alternative framing for genome editing could be Marker Assisted Selection. Marker Assisted selection relies on taking biological samples from animals and analysing these for the presence or absence of genetic markers associated with specific traits. Some of these markers (such as the ryanodine receptor/halothane gene) are single nucleotide changes. Marker Assisted Selection has been viewed more favourably than genetic modification by some stakeholder groups. For example Greenpeace has advocated Marker Assisted Selection in crop plants, on the basis of (1) respecting species barriers; (2) increasing the efficiency of traditional breeding without replacing it; and (3) treating genomes as coherent entities rather than transferring isolated gene sequences (Greenpeace International 2009).
Genome editing has some similarities with Marker Assisted Selection. It does not necessarily transgress species barriers and arguably treats the genome as a coherent entity in so far as any change involved is mimicking a natural mutation. However, genome editing does require a deliberate intervention that is not possible without biotechnological capability that is outside traditional farming practice. On the other hand, ‘traditional’ farming practice has already been supplemented in many cases by centralised specialist procedures that lie outside the traditional farming sphere. These include central performance testing, semen distribution, data collection, sophisticated sta- tistical analysis, and in the case of marker assisted selection above, biological sampling and analysis. Selective breeding is based on phenotypes, and separation of genotype and environment using statis- tical methods. This has further developed into genomic selection, which involves the use of tens of thousands of genetic markers across the genome rather than relying on individual markers. Genomic selection
123

390
Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398
 has been made possible through increases in comput- ing power, easier and cheaper availability of genotype information, and developments in statistical tech- niques. Genomic selection is being applied commer- cially in, for example, dairy cattle. Since the physical animal has already been ‘converted’ into data, and these data are increasingly converted to genetic information though genome selection, it seems a short step to begin to manipulate these DNA changes in purposeful ways. Genome editing and genome selec- tion may even become integrated, as suggested by Jenko et al. (2015). Thus the boundary between current practice of genomic selection and genome editing may become increasingly blurred.
What then is genome editing? Is it genetic modi- fication? Induced mutation? Marker Assisted Selec- tion? Or genome selection? Or something else? From the above discussion, these definitions cannot be answered merely from a scientific perspective, because genetic modification has become as much a social concept as a scientific concept.
The nuances that these descriptions capture for a scientific audience can be difficult to understand for those outside this specialist sphere. Evidence from psychology suggests that when confronted by a new phenomenon, people tend to use a fast way of thinking in order to make sense of that phenomenon (e.g. Forgas 2001; Kahneman 2011). This way of thinking seeks to identify what the new phenomenon is similar to, rather than carefully evaluating all the details. The results of this type of thinking can seem illogical to those versed in the details of a technology. In this way, for example, for a lay audience, genome editing could easily be rolled in with genetic modification, cloning and tasteless tomatoes in supermarkets.
It would of course be advantageous for developers of genome edited animals if they were able to avoid the onerous regulations associated with genetic mod- ification, so the argument that genome edited animals are not genetically modified because they are not transgenic, is attractive. In this next section I consider the interactions between genome editing and regulation.
GM regulation and genome editing
Two aspects of regulation are considered in this section. The first is whether genome edited animals
should be subject to the same regulations as GM animals. Here, I will primarily take an EU perspective, given the variety of regulatory approaches around the world. In this context, the main question is whether genome editing counts as genetic modification and is therefore subject to GM regulations? The second reflection is on the impacts that GM crop regulation has had on industry structures and the relative competitiveness of different sectors.
GM regulation and genome editing
GM salmon (AquAdvantageTM) modified for faster growth, has been at the forefront, worldwide, of the regulatory process for GM animals for food produc- tion (Van Eenennaam and Muir 2011). However, the approval process for AquAdvantageTM salmon (which used classical GM technology) was extremely oner- ous, and supporters of genome edited animals advo- cate much simpler, or even no regulatory constraints for genome edited animals.
The EU regulatory system was developed in the context of GM crops, is process based and depends on a specific definition of genetic modification. The EU defines a genetically modified organism as:
an organism, with the exception of human beings, in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination (Directive 2001/18/EC, Article 2(2))
A key question is therefore whether genome editing legally constitutes genetic modification in the EU or not? While the EU continues to debate this issue, some preliminary decisions have been made elsewhere.
A number of genome edited organisms have been determined to fall outside the regulatory purview of the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) e.g. mushrooms edited using CRISPR-Cas9 to reduce browning (Waltz 2016). However, regulatory oversight in the USA is not triggered by whether the process involves genetic modification. Rather the regulatory triggers for GM organisms are determined by the underlying laws and regulatory authorities of each U.S. regulatory agency and depends on the nature of the product. Similarly genome edited crop plants, such as canola, have gained Plant Novel Trait approval in Canada (Cibus 2014), where again regulation is not triggered by
123

Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398
391
 whether the process involves genetic modification. Within the EU there continues to be debate as to the regulatory status of plants produced by genome editing, with a variety of different interpretations being put forward (European Parliament 2016). The Swedish Board of Agriculture has concluded that some applications of CRISPR-Cas9 do not fall under the EU definition of a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) and the German Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety has come to a similar conclusion (European Parliament 2016).
On January 18, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017) released for public comment their Draft Guidance on the Regulation of Intention- ally Altered Genomic DNA in Animals. The draft guidance recommends that genome edited animals should be regulated in a manner similar to that used by the agency to regulate GM animals. At the time of writing, the draft guidance was still in the public comment period.
The narrow consideration of whether genome editing is a form of genetic modification or not, does not of course address the questions of what is the purpose of regulation. From the perspective of differ- ent genetic changes, Van Eenennaam and Young (2015), cogently argue that current regulatory regimes fail to reflect the scientific evaluation of risks from different applications. In practice, however, objections to developments may be on grounds other than risk, but are nevertheless expressed in terms of risk, as the only effective way of stopping a development that is unwanted (Tait 2001). Examples of such objections with respect to GM crops include excessive power of commercial companies over food systems and exces- sive industrialisation of agricultural practices. There is no clear mechanism where such objections can be considered, and hence arguments against develop- ments tend to focus on risk.
In the context of GM crops, suggestions have been made to establish ways of facilitating more open debate around the non-science based evaluations applied to policy decisions and making the basis for policy decisions more explicit (Devos et al. 2013). Areas suggested for more open debate by Devos et al. include clarifying policy objectives, determining what constitutes environmental (and by analogy animal welfare) harm, making explicit the normative basis of risk assessments (what level of risk is acceptable and
who should bear the risk), and weighing harms against benefits.
If genome editing is to be harnessed for animal welfare, environmental or social benefit then some kind of regulatory or other ‘carrot’ to drive in these directions, would provide the greatest opportunity for such developments, rather than merely relying on markets. An example from another industry sector, is the U.S. Food Quality Protection Act that gives preference to pesticides which provide environmen- tal benefits over current products. Some jurisdictions in Europe already include requirements for social benefit in the context of regulatory approval of biotechnology-derived animals. For example, Nor- way requires GMOs to benefit society and be ethically justifiable as well as not harmful (Library of Congress 2014). In Denmark cloning and genetic modification of animals is restricted to applications benefitting human health and the environment (NordForsk 2016). In the Netherlands, genetic mod- ification of animals for food purposes needs a license requiring the product to serve a public interest and have no overriding ethical objections (Government of the Netherlands 2016). However, these are all examples of regulatory ‘sticks’, designed to prevent applications, rather than ‘carrots’ designed to pro- mote applications considered to be particularly beneficial.
Regulatory regimes for genome edited livestock remain unclear, however, attempting to avoid all regulation could stimulate accusations that genome editing is trying to avoid public debate. By hiding the nature of genome editing developments people may be prevented from having any choice in the matter. Even if the regulatory regime for GM organisms is judged excessive for genome edited organisms, some kind of opportunity for public debate, and provision of methods for identifying products from genome edited animals seems necessary. For example, setting stan- dards for genome edited animals, perhaps drawing on the experiences of regulation of medical devices. Given that producing genome edited animals will require serious investment, it is likely that developers will seek to recoup costs by selling the resulting breeding animals at a premium, and therefore will not seek to ‘hide’ the fact that the animal is a result of genome editing. Nevertheless, such public perceptions may persist.

 Interaction between regulation and company strategies
Turning now to the second aspect of regulation, that of interactions between regulation, company strategies, relative competitiveness and innovation trajectories. Regulation arguable impacts are not just on the safety and efficacy of innovations but also on company strategies and the types of firm likely to be successful (Mittra et al.2011). Tait (2007) suggests that adopting a high regulatory burden for GM crops meant that large, multinational agrochemical companies were favoured over traditional crop seed producing firms. The agrochemical companies had both the funds and the expertise to deal with complex regulatory require- ments, which the seed companies did not have. If genome edited livestock will be required to comply with the same regulatory standards as GM crops, then again companies with the resources to cope with such regulatory burdens are likely to be favoured.
Analysis of agrochemical company strategies (Tait 2007; Tait and Chataway 2007) suggested that genetic modification of crops was disruptive innovation for this industry sector. Agrochemical companies used to innovation based on small chemical molecules needed novel innovation pathways for producing GM crops. The companies could not continue using existing innovation pathways, but instead required path-break- ing innovation involving new areas of research and new markets. At early stages of development of GM crops, agrochemical companies used various strate- gies to deal with this disruptive innovation, including acquiring seed companies (Monsanto and Dupont), collaborating with seed companies (AgrEvo, Zeneca, Novartis, Rhine Poulenc and Dow) or waiting to observe developments (BASF and Bayer) (Mittra et al. 2011).
In comparison, GM crops would have been incre- mental innovation for traditional seed producing companies. They could have continued their current innovation trajectories and gained competitive advan- tage through existing business practices (Tait 2007). Tait (2007) further suggests that had seed companies produced GM crops, the public outcome for GM crops may have been very different. The high standard of evidence required to satisfy regulatory requirements, however, has meant that regulation has effectively acted as a barrier to entry for smaller traditional seed producing firms (Tait 2007).
Research papers reporting the achievement of a few genome edited animals are important accounts of scientific advancements. However, it is not enough just to produce three or four genome edited animals for the application to become commercially viable. To produce a commercially viable product, the number of animals needs to be increased, and the animals and their products accepted by a range of stakeholders, including animal breeders, farmers, vets and super- market chains, as well as successfully negotiate any regulatory barriers. A plausible route to market is needed. In the case of genome edited animals, current developments appear to include those where a plau- sible route to market is developing. For example a major, global livestock breeding company, Genus plc, has announced it has an exclusive licence to use genome editing to commercially produce pigs resis- tant to PRRS (Genus 2015).
The international livestock breeding sector is well organised, particularly when considering chickens, pigs and dairy cows, although with some heterogene- ity. A number of global breeding companies dominate the sector. Specialist breeding companies undertake genetic selection to produce the next generation of livestock, multiply this stock (and often produce cross breeds) and sell to commercial farmers. Unlike crops, where the whole population can be rapidly replaced, introducing genome editing into a livestock popula- tion is a much more complex and time consuming process.
Although the entry of one major breeding company into genome editing is noted, the breeding company model is not the only one in existence in the supply of breeding stock, as state intervention in livestock breeding has been common in many European coun- tries. As with other industry sectors, there is evidence that the breeding sector has been shaped in part by regulation. In France, for example, state intervention, and then the withdrawal of the state from the breeding sector has had a profound impact on the commercial stakeholders (Hannachi and Tichit 2016). The 1966 Livestock Act, introduced to encourage the use of Artificial Insemination, resulted in the creation of monopoly breeder co-operatives in different regions, and the loss of influence by key individual breeders. The later Agricultural Orientation Law (2006) resulted in loss of state intervention, which together with technological changes due to the introduction of genomic selection, allowed the entry of multinational
123

Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398
393
 companies into the breeding sector. Hannachi and Tichit argue the result is that cattle breeding in France has moved from being a collective, collaborative exercise, to one that is practiced individually and characterised by competition (Hannachi and Tichit 2016). This is an example from the livestock produc- tion sector of the influence that regulation can play on subsequent industry development.
The nature of the genome editing application may also have an impact on the innovation trajectory and its impact on different parts of the livestock production system. Applications such as polledness are likely to be path-dependent for farms, although suppliers of materials to dehorn animals may see their markets decline and may need to identify novel markets. A cow which does not develop horns is still just a cow and the basic farm business model is not disrupted by its lack of horns. The hornlessness reflects improved animal welfare, labour savings in avoiding an unpleasant task and economic savings in materials and labour. How- ever, other potential genome edited products have the potential for more disruptive impacts.
The ability to avoid the need for castrating animals could have stronger animal welfare benefits, and additional benefits in reduced labour requirements, as well as better performance from animals that do not suffer a growth-check from the procedure. The process may also be potentially disruptive, for example if this allows novel meat products to be developed as pigs could be slaughtered at heavier weights if the taste taint from males is absent. An application which provides the ability of only producing commercially useful animals of the desirable sex has the potential to be disruptive in ways which are hard to predict, as reproduction could be limited to specific farms. There may need to be novel social or institutional arrange- ments that allow maintenance of the parent animals of both sexes, with consequent impacts on costs of production and distribution of control and ownership of breeding stock.
Public acceptability of such radical applications also need to be questioned. Few such data exist currently, although for example an on-line survey in the Netherlands (Gremmen and Blok 2016) asked respondents to compare the acceptability of a number of different options for dealing with unwanted male chicks in egg production. The respondents in this survey considered that genetically modifying chickens so that eggs with male chicks could be identified by
green fluorescence, was more acceptable than taking biological samples from non-genetically modified eggs to identify males by laboratory means. Although this is a small example, and may not be reflected in broader acceptability of using genome editing to alter sex ratios, it does indicate the importance of examin- ing public attitudes rather than presuming them.
Within the livestock production systems, different stakeholders are likely to be affected in different ways. Genome edited animals are sold to farmers not consumers. For farmers, genome edited animals are likely to be incremental innovations, whose manage- ment is path dependent. The ‘product’ is after all, a cow or pig, like any other. There may be additional recording and identification requirements if labelling and co-existence requirements are similar to those for GM crops in the EU. However, the demands for recording individual animals and animal movements in the EU are already considerable.
For breeders without laboratory science expertise, developing genome edited animals is likely to be path breaking, requiring the acquisition of new skills. However, larger companies in this sector have a very high degree of technical absorptive capacity. Distri- bution of genome edited animals is likely to be path dependent as the methods of distribution depend on the physical material. However, meeting the require- ments of intellectual property regimes allied to genome edited animals may prove to be disruptive. Hitherto the intellectual property in livestock breeding has been primarily protected by secrecy and use of cross-breeding. Genome edited animals could be path- dependent for meat processors and retailers, unless there are consumer requirements for labelling or campaigns against such products, in which case genome edited animals could require new business practices to be developed. One sector that could easily be affected, and for whom this is potentially a path- breaking development, is the veterinary sector.
Veterinary sector
Disease control is an initial focus for several genome editing projects, the examples of African Swine Fever and PRRS were given above. These diseases have few or no alternative treatments and also pose a significant economic threat to pig production. If genome edited disease resistant or tolerant animals are to be widely
123

394
Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398
 adopted, disease resistance would need to be incorpo- rated into overall disease management strategies at the individual farm, or even national, level.
Genetic disease resistance is intended to be used in disease prevention. However, based on a historical analysis of UK veterinary practice, Woods (2013) argues that vets have used the rhetoric of disease prevention, but found it difficult to deliver in practice for a variety of reasons. They have instead maintained an approach that focusses on treatments. Woods suggests that for effective prevention, an appropriate combination of veterinary, disease, farming and political drivers are required, all of which promote disease prevention. An important step is to engage the veterinary profession and other appropriate stakehold- ers to identify the drivers necessary for genome edited animals to be harnessed for animal health improve- ment. Some reflections on issues worth exploring are given in the following paragraphs.
Genome edited animals are unlikely to be adopted by all farmers. Therefore, it is likely that disease resistant or tolerant (depending on the nature of the edit), and disease susceptible animals would co-exist in commercial populations. Understanding the epi- demiological implications (if any) of introducing a novel resistance trait to some animals, could be one of the questions being addressed. Such an examination could also uncover veterinarians’ perceptions of genome edited disease resistant animals and the potential impact of such animals on their work.
Veterinarians are responsible for implementing disease control measures, particularly where there are specific legal requirements for doing so. This would be the case should there be a suspected emergence of African Swine Fever in the UK, for example. Genome editing thus could have much wider implications, because the suspicion that a notifiable disease of international significance is present can cause major disruption to international trade. The potential implications of genome editing for disease resistance in the event of any future outbreak of such diseases could therefore be explored by a range of stakeholders.
Part of the current European policy landscape is that the costs of exotic disease prevention should be shared between government and farmers, as opposed to governments bearing all the costs of exotic disease prevention. Could farmers be encouraged to keep disease resistant livestock by being given a greater
compensation if they do so, if an exotic disease outbreak were to occur? Farmer behaviour related to livestock disease is complex and context specific (Barnes et al. 2015). But if farmers were to be offered higher compensation for adopting disease resistant animals, then the resistance would need to be attested to in some way. This suggests the need for some kind of standards certification, which would identify ani- mals with appropriate disease resistance characteristics.
While these considerations are not unique to genome edited animals—some of the same could apply to selective breeding for disease resistance— addressing these types of questions could be important when considering commercial realities of genome edited animals. Taking account of the way in which veterinarians’ practices interact with genome edited animals in different circumstances would test interac- tions among different parts of a livestock production system.
The future of livestock production
GM crops were introduced in the late 1990s at a time when the use of chemicals in agriculture had become controversial. Advocating the introduction of crops that promoted the use of a pesticide or herbicide (although environmentally more benign than some others) in this context provided a ready basis for public resistance. There are currently many different (and often competing) visions for the future of livestock agriculture that set the wider context for genome editing. For example, the sector has come under intense pressure from environmental considerations, particularly the need to reduce greenhouse gas emis- sions, while at the same time responding to the imperative to increase livestock production to feed burgeoning populations (Godfrey et al. 2010). A recent policy paper from a European livestock indus- try perspective starts from the premise that the livestock sector has been identified as the world’s largest user of natural resources (Knowledge for Innovation 2015). This policy paper calls for innova- tion in the livestock sector that is environmentally sound, socially responsible and economically viable. The extent to which genome edited animals can contribute to visions of the future of agriculture will impact on future trajectories. Many different future
123

Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398
395
 visions exist. Two contrasting visions are provided here, as exemplars.
One vision of the future of agriculture focusses on the current, conventional, global systems of livestock production as typifying such a future. Typically, farms would continue to provide livestock products for global markets, with a strong emphasis on the efficiency of production. This vision would be likely to embrace application of various technologies such as exploiting information technology and the use of rapid environmental and biological diagnostics. Within this vision, measures to improve efficiency would be valued and might encompass a range of metrics, such as carbon footprints, the efficiency of use of animal feed for growth, and biological measures such as reproductive efficiency. Contributing to these effi- ciency measures would be viewed as contributing to delivering environmentally sound, socially responsi- ble and economically viable livestock production. In such a context, genome edited animals could be seen as consistent with these aspirations.
In contrast to the global production system, there are a group of alternative livestock production systems which aspire to transform the global production system. These alternative production systems are diverse, and include for example, Community Sup- ported Agriculture, urban agriculture, local produc- tion, and marketing through farmers’ markets and food hubs. They have developed partly as a way of resisting what is perceived as the dysfunctional current global production system. A key criticism of the global system is the way in which consumers have become separated from producers. Rather than emphasise metrics of efficiency, these alternative production systems stress equitable relationships between con- sumers and producers, and between livestock and human beings. Traditional forms of knowledge and use of breeds adapted to local conditions are empha- sised. New knowledge is by no means rejected but the role that genome edited animals could play in such a scenario is more questionable.
Genome editing for improved adaption to local conditions might be compatible with the aims of ‘alternative’ systems, for example if animals were edited to be more heat tolerant. However, genome editing may be rejected in principle by advocates of this future vision, on the grounds of reflecting an excessively instrumental relationship between humans and livestock. The emphasis in this future vision on
resistance to global livestock production systems may also militate against genome editing, if genome editing is perceived to be associated with those global systems.
Conclusions: key lessons for genome edited livestock
Genome editing promises the possibility of producing commercial livestock carrying precise genetic changes, which are difficult or impossible to achieve with selective breeding. Ultimately, the future of these developments will depend on political decisions, regulatory requirements and public acceptability, as well as technological capabilities. This paper has sought to draw on the experiences of the introduction of GM crops to examine the development of genome edited livestock. In particular, this paper extends the focus on science and regulation, to considering the wider context of livestock production systems.
Early applications of genome editing to livestock have taken into account the need to provide publicly recognised benefits, as a lesson learned from the production-focus of early GM crops applications. Initial applications have mainly focussed on welfare and disease resistance traits, although more profound changes to animal physiology have also been sug- gested, and may be realised in future. One of the challenges of meeting public aspirations for welfare benefit is the difficulty of agreeing on what is a welfare benefit. What may seem beneficial, or at least neutral, in terms of animal welfare for those familiar with livestock production, can be more controversial for others. Public views on more profound changes to physiology, e.g. altering sex ratios, are as yet, largely unexamined. In general attitudes are likely to be influenced by the particular reason given for the application, how beneficial or risky it is considered to be, and specific context of application and the alternatives available.
Early applications of genome editing in livestock have also focused on creating gene variants that exist in the same, or similar species, and seeking to avoid crossing species boundaries. Given the tendency among some people to conflate genetic modification with transgenesis, genome editing might be thought to provide an opportunity to avoid the regulatory impasse that in many cases has been a feature of GM animals.
123

 However, avoiding regulation for genome edited animals on the basis that they do not involve crossing species barriers would restrict applications of genome editing only to those that meet this requirement, and could discourage many other developments. At the other extreme, avoiding any kind of regulation for genome edited animals could also easily result in a public back-lash. Some publics may see unregulated adoption of the technology as a way to introduce (by stealth) practices that they think are cruel or unnec- essary. A carefully nuanced mechanism for identify- ing and regulating genome edited animals seems essential.
Genome editing applied to livestock production is not just a technical fix that can be effortlessly adopted without consequences to the wider production system. Stakeholders in the wider industry may react in ways that perturb current practices. These perturbations can be application specific or context specific, and may be difficult to predict without engagement with a range of appropriate stakeholders. In the case of GM crops, regulatory requirements and company strategies led to multinational agrochemical companies being favoured over crop seed producers. Early indications for genome edited livestock are, that at least one global breeding company is willing to adopt genome editing and has the capacity to deliver genome edited livestock to farmers. Adoption of genome editing is consistent with the expertise present in this company. It is not clear what impact genome editing will have on other industry stakeholders, such as smaller breeding organisations or nationally supported breeding co- operatives.
Genome edited specific disease resistant livestock can have implications on management of disease, in particular diseases that are exotic to the particular jurisdiction and which have the potential to disrupt international trade. On the other hand, disease resistant livestock could be incorporated as part of a package of actions aimed at better prevention of disease.
The wider context of livestock production is also important to consider. Pressure is increasing on the sector to reduce its environmental impact, while maintaining productivity. Whether genome editing can contribute to these aspirations remains to be seen.
Public support for genome edited livestock is essential for the promised products to gain wide market penetration. Frivolous, or controversial appli- cations raising public disquiet have the potential to
make it very difficult for future genome edited livestock applications to be socially accepted. Com- petition to be the first on the market needs to be tempered by consideration of the wider future of the technology. Focussing on technology and its regula- tory implications is important but more attention needs to be paid to interactions among stakeholders to better understand how genome edited animals could impact the broader livestock production sector.

abstract
Burkina Faso’s 2008 Bt cotton adoption was Africa’s largest genetically modified (GM) crop introduction principally for small farmers, and became its most celebrated success story. In 2016, however, Burkina Faso announced an abrupt phase-out of Bt cotton, citing millions of dollars of losses due to inferior lint quality. In hindsight, quality issues were conspicuously absent from the success narrative, particularly given that cotton sector actors were aware of problems for a decade. Recent data also reveal significantly lower yield gains and substantial inequalities between farmers, further questioning the success story and the evaluation literature it relied upon. Why and how was such a faulty and incomplete success narrative produced and promoted? To answer this, we draw on extended fieldwork conducted over ten years in Burkina Faso to critically examine how the knowledge used to build this success narrative was produced. We first scrutinize the evaluation literature, pointing out flaws and blindspots in the methodologies and reporting of findings. We then extend our analysis, drawing on political ecology and critical science stud- ies, to focus on the power relations of knowledge production. We focus on three themes and show how (1) the political economic context favored the production of positive results, with Monsanto holding sub- stantial power over the evaluation process, (2) the narrow epistemologies of agronomic evaluation pro- duced ‘‘apolitical” knowledge that overlooked how local-level power dynamics shaped data collection, and – in at least two cases (fertilizer application rates and seed costs) – the returns accrued by smaller-scale Bt cotton farmers, (3) the knowledge produced via these processes was used to accrue material benefits to Monsanto and helped to promote GM crops across the continent. We conclude that future GM crop evaluations should be more self-reflexive, critical, and transparent in how power shapes the evaluation process and agricultural outcomes for differentiated farmers.
    In 2008, Burkina Faso became the first African nation to com- mercially introduce a genetically modified (GM) crop to a signifi- cant number of smallholder farmers. Bt cotton, which provides insect resistance, was widely embraced by the Burkinabè cotton sector under the promise that it would increase yields and incomes, and boost overall cotton sector profitability and ‘‘compet- itivity.” Quite rapidly, Bt cotton was framed as a success story. Pro- ponents of a ‘‘Gene Revolution” for Africa extolled Burkina Faso’s rapid entry into the ranks of ‘‘biotech mega-countries” (James, 2009). With glowing reports of widespread Bt cotton adoption, ris- ing yields, increased farmer incomes, and efficient pest control (James, 2010; Pertry et al., 2016), Burkina Faso was held up as an example for other African countries to emulate, and as evidence

of the unequivocal benefits of GM crops for African smallholder farmers (ISAAA, 2010).
It thus came as an abrupt surprise to many when Burkina Faso’s cotton sector announced in early April 2016 that it would end Bt cotton production and return to ‘‘100% conventional” cotton (L’Economiste du Faso, 2016). The Inter-Professional Cotton Associ- ation of Burkina Faso (AICB, 2015), an umbrella group that consists of Burkinabè cotton companies and the cotton producers’ union, explained that Bt cotton had inferior quality characteristics which had resulted in major economic losses for the cotton companies. They reported a lower ginning ratio and a shorter fiber length than conventional Burkinabè cotton varieties. Whereas long-fiber con- ventional cotton had previously attracted a price premium and eager buyers on the international market, Burkinabè cotton com- panies were struggling to sell their shorter fiber Bt cotton. They reported economic losses of 48 billion CFA francs (roughly US$76 million), and sought compensation from Monsanto, the U.S. com- pany that had provided the Bt technology (Bavier, 2017).

Burkina Faso’s abrupt reversal on Bt cotton was surprising to many, given the widely promoted success narrative. Problems and discrepancies with Bt cotton, however, were apparent to those inside the cotton sector well before 2016. Burkinabè cotton sector officials and Monsanto executives were concerned about lint qual- ity and fiber length issues since 2006. Furthermore, aggregate cot- ton sector data revealed significantly lower average yield improvements (13%) associated with Bt cotton than the numbers cited in the peer-reviewed scientific literature and used in calculat- ing royalty payments for Monsanto (30%) (AICB, 2015). This large discrepancy in yield gains – and recent findings of major inequal- ities between poorer and wealthier farmers in how they benefited from Bt cotton (Sanou et al., 2018; Vognan &amp; Fok, 2019) – raise important questions about how yield data were generated, ana- lyzed, and reported in the Bt cotton evaluation literature. While lint quality issues led Burkina Faso to end Bt cotton production, both quality and yield issues indicate problems with the broader success narrative, which was either silent despite existing knowl- edge (on quality issues) or later found to be inaccurate (on yields and the distribution of benefits). We find it particularly puzzling that many problems were known about or suspected for many years yet were absent from the evaluation literature that pro- claimed Bt cotton in Burkina Faso as a success. How and why was such a faulty and incomplete narrative produced and promoted?
The research presented in this article focuses on the power rela- tions of knowledge production as a way to understand the creation and endurance of Burkina Faso’s Bt cotton success narrative. The case of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso is particularly significant, as it was not only a highly visible pioneer of GM crop commercializa- tion in Africa, but also one of the only cases worldwide of a major reversal in GM crop production. Examining the production, and the surprising persistence, of the success narrative surrounding this case holds lessons for how to understand and assess GM crop development in Africa.
We begin by situating our work in a broader political ecology literature which explores the relationship between different forms of power and knowledge production in relation to GM crops. We then examine methodological and conceptual issues in the Bt cot- ton evaluation literature in Burkina Faso, pointing to the need for a deeper analysis of how material interests and unequal relation- ships between actors shaped, or were overlooked in, the produc- tion of knowledge. We examine the power / knowledge production nexus in three parts. First, we analyze the political economy of knowledge production, exposing important conflicts of interest, which help to explain key silences in the reporting of problems. Second, we examine how the resulting evaluation liter- ature was ‘‘apolitical,” meaning that it ignored how local-level power relations shaped both data collection and Bt cotton out- comes for cotton producers. Many of the glaring oversights in the success narrative resulted from a failure to recognize how relation- ships between farmers and cotton company employees can dra- matically affect farmers’ seed costs, fertilizer use, and consequent farm outcomes. Third, we examine how this apolitical knowledge production process served to reproduce uneven material benefits in favor of the biotech industry in Africa. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for ongoing GM crop debates in Africa and beyond.
1. Knowledge politics, success narratives, and GM crops
In the contemporary moment of ‘‘post-truth” politics, in which deconstructionist logics have been deployed to question all kinds of truth claims, many scientists – including those who study GM crops – have sought to defend the idea of neutral, disinterested,
and apolitical science. Yet part of the practice of science is contin- uous scrutiny of scientific knowledge. Neimark et al. (2019) argue for the renewed importance of careful social scientific study of the relationships between power and the production of knowledge. They note that ‘‘foregrounding (once again) these relationships between political power and truth claims makes it possible to clar- ify mechanisms of knowledge production and exclusion” (p. 3), allowing us to understand how ‘‘power constitutes, moves within, and reproduces socio-material relations to shape which knowl- edges, social relations, and practices (and corresponding ecologies) are hegemonic” (p. 4). In other words, despite impulses to circle the wagons in defense of apolitical science, critical social scientists must continue to illuminate and critically analyze the power-laden processes of knowledge production.
Since the post-structural turn in the 1990s, the field of political ecology has broadly examined linkages between power, discourse, and knowledge claims (Forsyth, 2013; Peet &amp; Watts, 2002; Robbins, 2012). Political ecologists and other critical social scien- tists have drawn from Foucault and poststructuralism to examine how the linkages of discourse and power shape our very parame- ters of thought and action. As in Bourdieu’s concepts of doxa and domination or Gramsci’s theory of hegemony (Burawoy &amp; Von Holdt, 2012), discourses or knowledge structures shape peoples’ assumptions, the models they use, and what comes to be consid- ered ‘‘truth.” Many scholars have interrogated how the production of certain kinds of apolitical and ostensibly neutral scientific knowledge is actually deeply intertwined with the re-production of material power (Ferguson, 1994; Leach &amp; Mearns, 1996; Mitchell, 2002; Robbins, 2012). For example, ‘‘scientific forestry” was used in India to advance timber extraction while significantly transforming livelihoods and disenfranchising local communities (Bryant, 1997; Guha, 2000). Goldman examined how the World Bank funds the production of expert knowledge, which it then uses to ‘‘underwrite a particular ideology of development” (2005, p. 174). Forsyth and Walker (2008) have argued that environmental discourses about forest loss in Thailand rely on selective forms of knowledge that reinforce social structures, particularly ethnic divisions.
Sociologists and historians of science have also examined the growing links between industry and scientific research, asking crit- ical questions about how the scientific knowledge produced through such partnerships – and what the public hears about this science – gets shaped by commercial interests (Frickel &amp; Hess, 2014; Mirowski, 2011; Moore et al., 2011; Oreskes &amp; Conway, 2011). In the case of biotechnology, research by Glenna et al. (2015) shows how ‘‘the intellectual property protections in GE (ge- netically engineered) crops are hindering some types of agricul- tural and environmental research,” (p. 166) despite concerted efforts to allow for such public research to occur (also see Kloppenburg, 2004; Tansey &amp; Rajotte, 2008). Of particular interest is the question of silences, including how Material Transfer Agree- ments and confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements shape sci- entific research, and the question of ‘‘undone science” – the fact that many important questions are simply not researched (Frickel et al., 2010).
Critical social scientists examining GM crops in the Global South have focused on power and knowledge production but have seldom examined both in tandem. One strand of research exami- nes the networks and actors promoting GM crops globally, and in Africa in particular. Recent scholarship examines the broader political-economic landscape in which coalitions of actors have sought to promote and build consensus around GM crops (Harsh, 2014; Ignatova, 2017; Schurman, 2017). Donor dependence (in- cluding the funding and training of African scientists) and the eco- nomic interests of corporations strongly shape these coalitions (Rock, 2019; Rock &amp; Schurman, 2020; Schnurr, 2013; Schurman,

2017). Several scholars have built on Gramsci’s notion of hege- mony (Andrée, 2007; Newell, 2009; Schnurr, 2013). Newell (2009) introduced the term ‘‘biohegemony” to examine how pow- erful groups produce consent to GM crops through the use of mate- rial, institutional, and discursive power. Discursive power, he argues, ‘‘derives from and expresses itself in the ability to construct and reinforce dominant framings of issues” (p. 52). Drawing on Newell, Schnurr (2013) examines the ‘‘constellations of power” – networks of organizations, corporations, and institutions – that create consent for the narrative that GM crops are the only solution to African agriculture. Other parallel scholarship has emphasized how these powerful dominant (productivist and techno-centric) perspectives emphasize particular expectations and narrowly frame debates around GM crops (Dowd-Uribe, 2017; Glover, 2010b; Jansen &amp; Gupta, 2009; Moseley et al., 2015; Scoones &amp; Thompson, 2011).
A second strand of research analyzes shortcomings in the eval- uation literature undergirding GM crop success narratives in the Global South. Scholars have found persistent methodological prob- lems in the GM crop evaluation literature in India and South Africa: narrow evaluation criteria, selective interpretation of evidence and data (Glover, 2010a), methodological problems in comparison known as selection and cultivation bias (Stone, 2011, 2012), and a downplaying of significant variability by reporting findings in averages (Glover, 2010a; Stone, 2011; Thompson &amp; Scoones, 2009). These concerns about problematic evaluation methodolo- gies contribute to a broader literature critical of how pro-GM suc- cess narratives rely on epistemologically narrow economic analyses that are disembedded from broader social, institutional, and historical contexts (Dowd-Uribe, 2014a, 2017; Flachs, 2019; Glover, 2010a; Jansen &amp; Gupta, 2009; Schnurr, 2012, 2019; Smale et al., 2006; Stone, 2011, 2012; Thompson &amp; Scoones, 2009).
We draw from both strands of research to examine the power dimensions of GM crop knowledge production in Burkina Faso. Our analysis employs a broad political ecology approach to power, paying attention to who has the ability to exercise influence, shape discourses, gain access to resources, and who (or what knowledge) is marginalized in relation to these abilities (Robbins, 2012). We thus examine how dominant epistemologies of agronomy and eco- nomics are intertwined with the economic interests of agri- businesses that often fund those research programs. In a classic political ecology vein, we are interested in how ‘‘apolitical narra- tives” that appear neutral, in fact, work to render invisible the material interests at stake (Ferguson, 1994), particularly relations of inequality and marginalization. Finally, we pay attention to how this process of knowledge production served to reproduce material benefits and the favorable position of the biotech industry in Africa.
2. Data and methods
This paper draws on multiple datasets, including an extensive review and content analysis of existing literature on Bt cotton in Burkina Faso. We also draw on two sets of long-term, qualitative data collected by the authors in Burkina Faso, indicating, where appropriate, upon which data we are drawing.1
The first author conducted eight months of ethnographic field- work in 2016, during Bt cotton phase-out negotiations and the return to conventional cotton. This author conducted 125 inter- views with cotton sector actors, including employees of the state-owned cotton company Société Burkinabè des Fibres Textiles (SOFITEX), government employees and research scientists, Mon-

santo employees, non-governmental actors, and 80 interviews with male and female cotton farmers. Fieldwork also included one month of participant observation with SOFITEX, attendance at a regional cotton conference and anti-GMO activist events, and five months of participant observation in a farming community in the Houndé region near Koumbia. The author conducted research in French and Dioula, languages the author speaks flu- ently. This enabled data collection not just from interviews but from the conversations and interactions of daily life, including extended farm visits, observations of conflicts and disputes, and long evenings of conversation with diverse groups of people.
The second author conducted eleven months of ethnographic field work between 2007 and 2009, during the final farmer field tri- als and first commercial growing season of Bt cotton. The author conducted over 100 interviews of actors implicated in the intro- duction of Bt cotton, including cotton sector officials in all three Burkinabè cotton companies, the Burkinabè Ministry of Agricul- ture, Burkina Faso’s Agricultural Research Institute – the Institut de l’Environnement et des Recherches Agricoles (INERA) (where he held a research affiliation), Monsanto, Syngenta, the World Bank, the French Development Agency, anti-GM groups and activists, and implicated local NGOs. This author also attended farmer field trials, two regional conferences on GM crops held in September 2007 and October 2008, and a November 2008 training on refugia sponsored by Monsanto. Additionally, this author conducted a sur- vey of 70 heads of household in one of the most productive cotton growing areas in Burkina Faso (Tuy Province) in February of 2009. This paper also draws from further trips to cotton growing commu- nities and interviews with cotton sector officials and cotton grow- ers in Burkina Faso totaling ten weeks in 2012, 2013, and 2018.
3. Portrait of a young success story
To briefly review, Burkina Faso conducted its first confined field trials of Bt cotton from 2003 to 2005. These trials were of two imported American Bt cotton cultivars (Coker 312 and DP50), which included the patented host material of their international partner, Monsanto. These original field trials reported an average yield increase of 14.7% (Vitale et al., 2008). Burkinabè cotton sector officials, however, wanted to use a Bt cotton cultivar that retained the agro-climatic adaptation and quality characteristics resulting from decades of local breeding efforts. At their request, the Bt trait was backcrossed onto three local cultivars – FK 290, FK 37, and STAM 59A – and reproduced for three generations with the aim of retaining desired characteristics (Dowd-Uribe &amp; Schnurr, 2016). Two of these new cultivars (FK95 BG II and FK96 BG II) were tested in a small field trial in Boni in 2006, and then on 20 farmer- led field trial sites in 2007. The peer reviewed literature on these field trials reported an average yield gain of 34% (Vitale et al., 2011). These field trials were the subject of great attention, receiv- ing visits from an international delegation in October 2007 of mul- tiple African countries, sponsored by USAID. Subsequent Bt evaluation publications were based on field surveys conducted by INERA (Burkina Faso’s Agricultural Research Institute) in 2009 of 160 cotton producers (Vitale et al., 2010), and then similar sur- veys from 2009 to 2014 (Vitale et al., 2016).
Just as in other GM crop-adopting countries in the Global South, pro-GM organizations portrayed Bt cotton in Burkina Faso as an unmitigated success. There were also, as elsewhere, pockets of anti-GM resistance and counter-narratives coming from both within and outside Burkina Faso, but these voices were generally disregarded by Burkinabè cotton sector officials and partners (Luna, 2020a). The dominance of GM advocacy organizations in constructing a success narrative was clear. They published reports with celebratory titles such as ‘‘Six Years of Successful Bt Cotton

Cultivation in Burkina Faso” (Karembu et al., 2014) or, ‘‘The success story of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso” (Pertry et al., 2016). Even after Burkina Faso’s phase out of Bt cotton, the narrative of success con- tinued. One organization in particular, Cornell’s Alliance for Science, published articles claiming that ‘‘GM cotton in Burkina Faso has in reality been a runaway success” (Conrow, 2016), and that the withdrawal of Bt cotton was ‘‘reversing the tide of pro- gress” (Gakpo, 2017). The post-withdrawal success narrative often framed Burkina Faso’s reversal as based on a simple ‘‘technical problem” (See Luna, 2020a). Importantly, Monsanto and other international organizations known for promoting biotechnology (e.g. the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications, or ISAAA, and Cornell’s Alliance for Science) played a disproportionate role in creating and propagating this success narrative.
What is striking about this success narrative is that nearly all of these articles and reports relied on and reproduced the same set of numbers and basic claims: that Bt cotton offered farmers 20% or even 30% yield improvements and increased ‘‘smallholder farmer profits by an average of 51 percent” (Gakpo, 2019). These and related numbers were consistently repeated and assumed to be proven. ISAAA used these numbers. Academic articles used these numbers, as in an article titled ‘‘Africa’s inevitable walk to geneti- cally modified (GM) crops” (Okeno et al., 2013). Monsanto’s inter- nal advice to employees regarding how to respond to questions about Bt cotton in Burkina Faso included the following line: ‘‘It has been proven that farmer income on average has increased up to 50%” (FleishmanHillard, 2015).
Significantly, these claims were drawn from a small number of studies from a narrow evaluation epistemology with significant methodological issues. We contend that these studies provided a thin and faulty basis on which to make grand claims about the suc- cess of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso. As Thompson and Scoones (2009, p. 391) remind us: ‘‘models are of course only as good as the assumptions and the data on which they are built.” In analyzing these studies, we find many of the same fundamental problems that have been found in the GM evaluation literature on Bt cotton in India and South Africa (Glover, 2010a; Schnurr, 2012; Stone, 2011, 2012). Here, we outline some of these central empirical con- cerns, before turning our analysis to how the production of this apolitical success narrative was itself a product of and productive of unequal power relations.
Finally, although we are critical of the unmitigated success nar- rative, we also want to be clear that we witnessed several brack- eted benefits from Bt cotton in Burkina Faso, most notably pesticide use reduction (a significant benefit for farm families exposed to toxic insecticides) and yield and labor productivity improvements for some farmers. These benefits were often ignored or denied by anti-GM activists. Our analysis seeks to carve out space for a more nuanced assessment.
3.1. Critical omissions and spurious claims
The critical literature on GM crops has well established that crop evaluation studies downplay or omit issues that operate at longer time scales,2 and obscure differential outcomes via a focus on average results (Glover, 2010a). These criticisms hold true for the Burkina Faso case as well. Curiously, the very same literature that establishes the ‘‘average” claims used to push a success narra- tive also documents significant differences in outcomes for farmers.
2 Concerns have been raised about the emergence of pest resistance and secondary pests in areas of intensive Bt cultivation. The dominant narrative in Burkina Faso either assumed refugia were planted or ignored the issue entirely. Yet our evidence indicates that refugia were rarely – if at all – planted (see below).
These findings are minimized, however, through linguistic framing and a general neglect of these findings.
Evaluation studies of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso regularly used ‘‘averages” in abstracts, introductions, and conclusions to assert the benefits of Bt cotton. These reported averages were widely cir- culated in news coverage and used to build the success narrative of Bt cotton. These averages, however, obscured substantial variabil- ity and differences in outcomes for farmers, which can be found buried in these same analyses. For example, one early paper claims that ‘‘the results found that across all years and both sites, that Bollgard II cotton provided a significant yield advantage of 14.7% over conventional cotton” (Vitale et al., 2008, p. 1964). Yet this claim obscures their own finding of a significant yield advantage in only two out of three years of research trials. Another paper claims that ‘‘Bt cotton producers earned a profit of $39.00 per ha, a $61.88 per ha increase in cotton income over conventional cot- ton, and also shifted producers’ bottom line from a negative posi- tion to a positive one” (Vitale et al., 2010, p. 320). This claim was based on a partial budget analysis, and the calculated profit gain was primarily a function of an estimated (average) 18.2% yield gain. However, the data in this paper (which suffer from major lim- itations which we discuss below) reveal significant variability. In one data table (p. 326), of 24 different combinations of farm size, region, and number of pesticide sprays, ten of these categories of farmers had negative revenue farming Bt cotton.3 Nonetheless, the paper glosses over this variability and instead gives the impres- sion of uniform or reliable gains via the reporting of averages, as in the quote above.
Beyond issues of selective reporting and placement of findings, at times the evaluation literature forwards assertions that lack evi- dence. One paper claimed that ‘‘Bt cotton increases land productiv- ity compared to conventional cotton, which (all else equal) provides a positive impact on the environment by reducing pres- sure on agricultural land” (Vitale et al., 2016, p. 128), which is a claim often made by GM crop advocates. However, our own field- work found that all else isn’t equal. Many larger-scale Bt cotton farmers reported increased acreage of cotton because of decreased labor requirements for insecticide spraying. A survey by Sanou et al. (2018) also substantiates this finding. Thus, this claim of reduced land pressure is unsubstantiated and likely to be false.
3.2. Methodological concerns regarding counterfactuals
In addition to issues regarding the reporting of findings and erroneous assertions, the evaluation literature also suffers from methodological issues with the ‘‘counterfactual,” or what Bt cotton was compared to. Counterfactual issues can be a significant (and often invisible) source of bias and can lead to over-estimates of GM crop yield differences (Stone, 2012). In brief, when Bt cotton yields are compared to conventional cotton yields, all other sources of yield variation need to be accounted for and controlled for. Two common counterfactual issues in the GM crop evaluation literature are ‘‘selection bias” and ‘‘cultivation bias.” Selection bias means that studies fail to control for underlying differences between farmers who ‘‘select” into growing Bt versus conventional. Com- parisons are then muddled because yield differences may be caused by different characteristics of farmers and not necessarily the GM trait. Cultivation bias means that the studies fail to control for differences in how farmers cultivate the two crops, such as treating Bt fields differently than conventional fields.
3 Negative revenue appears to have occurred for farmers in each region, at each level of pesticide spraying, and for each category of farm size. The paper gives no indication of how many farmers are in each category. This is just one example of contradictory data or confusing claims within these papers.
  
Here, we briefly discuss how these two sources of counterfactual error were likely present in much of Burkina Faso’s Bt yield evalua- tion literature, in particular 1) the on-farm field trials from 2006 and 2007 and, 2) the post-commercialization farmer surveys conducted by INERA between 2009 and 2014. A third – very different – source of yield data comes from aggregate cotton company statistics, which were used to establish cotton yield trends in a 2015 report (AICB, 2015). Cotton companies calculate yields by dividing the total weight of cotton received at the gin by the total production area. Total production area is derived from cotton cooperative data from individual villages and from data compiled by cotton company extension agents and coordinators. While these aggregate data have benefits (particularly in being a whole population data set, not a sample), they also do not control for selection or cultivation bias in comparing Bt and conventional yields.4 Here we focus principally on the issues with the evaluation literature, since this literature pro- duced the data upon which the success narrative was built.
Early on-farm field trials in 2006 and 2007 likely suffered from both selection and cultivation bias. The major article establishing the empirical results of these trials (Vitale et al., 2011) contains no statement about how yield gains were measured, nor any infor- mation on the counterfactual (that is, data on conventional cotton yields) used to establish claims of an average 34% yield gain. Yet these trials likely suffered from selection bias, based on our inter- views. Bt farmers were selected by the cotton companies and were generally ‘‘model” farmers who followed recommended practices. The trials also likely suffered from cultivation bias. Bt farmers were slated to receive an international delegation in their fields, a strong incentive to make sure that GM crops were well maintained. Sim- ilarly, the Burkinabè cotton sector officials guiding these field trials had an enormous incentive to make sure that the farmers were fol- lowing advised protocols – including but not limited to advised fer- tilizer application rates and pesticide spraying regimes. These incentives and differences in treatment likely exaggerated the dif- ference between Bt and conventional cotton yields.
Subsequent on-farm evaluation studies (Vitale et al., 2010, 2016) also likely suffered from selection and cultivation bias. The 2010 paper claims to compare yields and profits between Bt and conventional cotton, yet provides no explanation of how research- ers obtained data for conventional cotton yields. Stone (2012, p. 67) ascertained that the counterfactual likely came from refugia: areas of conventional cotton that are designated primarily to grow insects, not cotton, in order to forestall the emergence of pest resis- tance to the Bt toxin. Comparisons with conventional cotton grown in refugia would result in over-estimates of Bt cotton yield differ- ences since farmers would be unlikely to treat refugia with the same care. Additionally, our research spanning several years never came across a refugia, and numerous interviews with cotton sector actors indicated that refugia were unlikely to have been planted. A survey in 2015 (Sanou et al., 2018) found that 92% of farmers had never heard of them. Moreover, INERA was conducting research on whether non-cotton crops and natural plants could serve as refu- gia. These findings raise further questions about how conventional cotton yield data were obtained.
Other forms of selection and cultivation bias also likely skewed results. Comparing farmers growing Bt with those growing con- ventional can be problematic because of selection bias in the types of farmers who grow Bt versus conventional. A 2016 paper pro-
4 Further, as we discuss below, there are various reasons for farmers to mis-report their cotton production area, which consequently reduces yield estimate accuracy. We do not, however, know, nor have reason to believe, that production area reporting dynamics are significantly different (i.e. trending to over- or under-report acreage) between Bt and conventional farmers. In this sense, the aggregate data produced by SOFITEX may be the best available yield comparison estimates in the absence of the paired control experiments we suggest, and without more information regarding how evaluatory literature yield estimates were derived.
vides evidence for this, yet ignores and obfuscates its own evi- dence. The paper finds that ‘‘Bt cotton farms were 60% larger in field size than conventional farms and also had a larger household supply of agricultural labor and working animals than conven- tional farmers” (Vitale et al., 2016, p. 127). The paper also finds that larger farms have higher yields than smaller farms, for both con- ventional and Bt cotton farmers. Farm size and fertilizer use differ- ences between Bt and non-Bt growers were also found by Vognan and Fok (2019). These differences matter because the claim of Bt ‘‘yield advantages” appears to be based on non-controlled compar- isons. In other words, these are not paired studies with replicated field trials to account for soil variability, rainfall, pest pressures, and farming practices such as timing of planting, cultivation tech- niques, and the crucial factor of fertilizer application (which we examine below). Instead, yields from Bt cotton farms were simply compared with yields from conventional cotton farms, which is our best guess given the limited methodological descriptions in the lit- erature. An additional source of error in these comparisons may have resulted from cultivation bias, or differences in how farmers attended to Bt cotton fields. For example, farmers may have given more inputs and attention to Bt cotton than conventional cotton because of the higher seed cost of Bt cotton, more scrutiny from extension agents, or the higher potential for debt if the Bt crop failed (see below), as has been documented with Bt cotton adop- tions in other parts of the Global South (Stone, 2011, 2012).
Taking a step back, it is remarkable to consider that these few studies from a narrow evaluative epistemology, with significant methodological issues and biases in the reporting of findings, became the basis for a Bt cotton success narrative. Data that showed significant variation were glossed over with optimistic claims about average gains, and study designs failed to properly account for the effects of selection and cultivation bias in shaping yields. More critical studies (many of them independently con- ducted) have begun raising concerns about the dominant success narrative, with several studies finding that poorer/smaller-scale/l ess-equipped farmers were more likely to lose money by growing Bt cotton, and faced higher risks with Bt cotton (Dowd-Uribe, 2014a; Fok, 2016; Renaudin et al., 2012; Sanou et al., 2018; Vognan &amp; Fok, 2019). Furthermore, aggregate data from the Burk- inabè cotton sector showed that Bt cotton farms only had a 13% yield advantage over conventional cotton farms between 2009 and 2015 (AICB, 2015). Nonetheless, the success narrative and its inflated yield numbers remained the dominant story of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso. Why and how were these narrow and problematic knowledge claims produced and disseminated?
4. The political economy of knowledge production
We now turn to analyzing the political economy of the knowl- edge production process, highlighting the structures and incen- tives that shaped Bt cotton evaluation research in Burkina Faso. As Stone has argued, ‘‘we are naïve in swallowing empirical claims without a careful consideration of how vested interests affect the creation of facts” (2012, p. 64). We focus on the conflicts of interest inherent to the Bt cotton evaluation process, and in particular how Monsanto funding and control over the research process – princi- pally through a contract with INERA – significantly influenced the production and reporting of research findings. In this context, some Burkinabès expressed that their concerns challenging the success narrative were either silenced or left unexamined. These findings echo the broader literature on how industry influences science and biotechnology evaluation, and specifically how Mon- santo has regularly sought to shape and control scientific evalua- tions of its products in order to advance its economic interests (see McHenry, 2018).

4.1. Conflicts of interest
Bt cotton adoption in Burkina Faso provided an important financial boost for struggling public research institutions, and for Burkinabè researchers. Bt cotton was introduced through a part- nership between Monsanto, INERA, and the AICB. Of particular interest is the connection between Monsanto funding and Bt cot- ton evaluations. Data from our interviews indicates that Monsanto provided funding for multiple years of field trials, evaluation stud- ies, a lab to support breeding efforts, trainings for Burkinabè staff for breeding efforts, and for Burkinabè scientists and cotton sector officials to disseminate results in conferences and other venues.
This financial support came as public funding for agricultural research in Burkina Faso (and sub-Saharan African countries more broadly) had declined significantly since the mid 2000s, following the completion of two World Bank loans for agricultural research (Beitema &amp; Stads, 2014; Author interviews). In 2016, INERA’s direc- tor explained that the state ‘‘keeps the lights on,” but research funds generally come from outside donors. Several research directors explained that this dependence on external funding severely limits the kind of research they can do, because donors (and certainly cor- porations) have specific interests regarding what they will fund and short-term time horizons. While cotton sector research in Burkina Faso is better off than other sectors, it was nonetheless affected by these cuts. INERA was severely affected, relying on contributions from the cotton companies, and experiencing budget shortfalls that occasionally delayed salary payments for INERA employees (Dowd- Uribe, 2014a). This institutional situation meant that the opportu- nity to cooperate with Monsanto – and receive research funding from Monsanto – was an appealing opportunity for the Burkinabè cotton sector, research centers, and individual scientists.
The importance of Bt cotton funding for INERA highlights the power imbalances between African countries and the private and philanthropic organizations who fund biotechnology research (Ignatova, 2017; Rock &amp; Schurman, 2020; Schurman, 2017; C. B. Thompson, 2014). Funding from these entities is often portrayed as a much-needed lifeline for African research institutes. However, this funding also tends to come with explicit and implicit messages about the kind of research that will be done (Schnurr, 2013; Schurman, 2018), and often comes with Material Transfer Agree- ments, which may contain confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements regarding research processes (Mirowski, 2011; Tansey &amp; Rajotte, 2008).
It is in this political economic context that Monsanto-funded North American researchers and Burkinabè researchers from INERA collaborated to evaluate Bt cotton. Several academic papers and book chapters evaluating Bt cotton were even published with Monsanto co-authors, without accompanying ‘‘conflict of interest” statements (Vitale et al., 2008; Vitale &amp; Greenplate, 2014). Further complicating the institutional ties connecting researchers with Monsanto, INERA was also part of a contract with Monsanto. According to one scientist, ‘‘because INERA had signed a contract with Monsanto, Monsanto reviewed all our publications and pre- sentations.” This scientist explained that there were clear (if unstated) expectations for the kind of findings they should report, and felt that ongoing employment or promotion was implicitly dependent on meeting those expectations:
We saw photos of the Monsanto presidents with our president, and we knew they (Monsanto) had access to all of the ministers, but we do not. And so we self-censored. . . If you are in the good camp, you will be rewarded. If you are not, you will be set aside or marginalized.
Researchers in Burkina Faso – like other researchers worldwide – may also fear retribution or slander campaigns (Waltz, 2009). It
should be noted that there is a small community of research scien- tists in Burkina Faso, with revolving doors between INERA, SOFITEX, Monsanto (during its time in Burkina Faso), and related organiza- tions. Working for Monsanto was highly sought after since these positions had higher and secured pay, and international travel opportunities. These jobs are extraordinarily valuable in a country with few employment opportunities for specialized researchers.
Our point here is that there were significant conflicts of interest shaping the research context that produced the Bt evaluation liter- ature. Those charged with gathering and publishing data were not ‘‘independent” evaluators, which is ostensibly the role of state agencies and scientific researchers. Instead, they were dependent upon funding from a corporation that sought to sell the product they were evaluating, and bound by a contract that gave Monsanto oversight of their research. In addition to being constrained by this contract, many may have felt that their careers depended on facil- itating this partnership.
4.2. Silences
Building from this, we can also examine how this situation of institutional dependence shaped relationships between Burkinabè scientists and non-Burkinabè Monsanto employees. Several scien- tists and senior employees at various institutions in Burkina Faso said their knowledge and concerns had been sidelined by Mon- santo. In particular, Burkinabè scientists said they were aware early on of problems with Bt cotton’s ginning ratio and fiber length. Monsanto was also aware of these concerns, as revealed in inter- views with a Monsanto employee in 2008, and later by the fact that Monsanto paid financial compensation for the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 cotton seasons for these issues (AICB, 2015). These issues were thus known (on all sides), yet completely silenced in the success narrative of Bt. None of the Monsanto or INERA co- authored papers mentioned these issues, even in papers published as late as 2016.5
Some Burkinabè scientists felt that part of this silencing was due to a systematic – and potentially racialized – disrespect for Burkinabè scientists and their knowledge (also see Eddens, 2019; Luna, 2018; Rock, 2019; and see Ezezika et al., 2012 for similar comments from Burkinabè scientists). One senior scientist explained that he felt that non-Burkinabè Monsanto employees viewed African scientists as less qualified, and that because of this, Burkinabè scientists’ concerns were dismissed. In an interview, fol- lowing a discussion of the fiber-length issues, he explained:
Respondent: What happened, I don’t think it would have hap- pened if they had taken us seriously. Because we had the impres- sion that they underestimated the local (Burkinabè) researchers.
Interviewer: Who did?
Respondent: Monsanto. We had the impression that. . . so a PhD is a PhD. When we began to talk about problems (such as the short fiber length issue), they didn’t believe us. Otherwise, we could have found a solution much earlier.
Interviewer: So the Monsanto people weren’t believing local Burkinabè researchers.
Respondent: Exactly. . . I remember one time, I had to say to their director, I said, ma’m, you are a lawyer, when you speak, we lis- ten to you when you are talking about the law, correct? So why, when I talk about agronomy, why do you tell me that what I’m saying is false? Ma’m, you must respect me. Diploma for diploma.
5 More recent papers with INERA authors have been more critical of Bt cotton (Sanou et al., 2018; Vognan &amp; Fok, 2019). Interestingly, these were published after the end of Monsanto’s contract.
 
Another senior researcher recounted that many Burkinabè sci- entists were aware of fiber length issues early on, and also had con- cerns about high seed costs for farmers, but that their concerns and input were pushed aside. This researcher explained that:
In 2006, they backcrossed into Burkinabè varieties. In 2008, Monsanto said, ‘It’s ready.’ We (Burkinabè) scientists, we said no, we need to do more backcrossing. But Monsanto said there’s no problem...But in 2006, already, they knew that the fiber length was shorter. The ginning ratio was also a problem. But Monsanto said, when we make a few changes, and do it at a broader scale, it won’t be a problem. And the deals were done (gesture to indicate behind closed doors), and it was introduced. And the researchers didn’t have a whole lot of say in it. And we thought, well maybe this will work out. Maybe Monsanto knows how to fix the issue.
As both of these scientists indicate, there was a significantly unequal power dynamic between Monsanto and Burkinabè research institutions. Rather than this being a story of ‘‘knowledge sharing,” as is often promoted in discourses of bringing GM crops to Africa, many Burkinabè researchers felt that Monsanto side- stepped local actors, and in some cases, failed to heed their input. Of course, this wasn’t a simple power dynamic of Monsanto versus Burkina Faso. Local Monsanto employees were Burkinabè research- ers (most of whom previously worked for INERA or SOFITEX), and multiple actors and institutions were jockeying for influence (Compaoré Sawadogo, 2018). Nonetheless, our findings indicate that Monsanto’s substantial power in a country like Burkina Faso likely created a situation that silenced some voices and kept signif- icant issues with Bt cotton from coming to the public eye.
5. Apolitical knowledge production
In this section we examine how the knowledge produced to evaluate Bt cotton was partial and in some aspects even wrong, lar- gely because it was framed by an apolitical view that technology can – and should – be evaluated separately from the world in which it is embedded (Flachs, 2019; Glover, 2010; Luna, 2020a; Schnurr, 2019). This builds on our earlier analysis of the problem- atic methodologies and narrow epistemologies of the Bt evaluation literature. Here, we add an analysis of power, showing the addi- tional issues that resulted from a methodology that failed to acknowledge or examine the power dimensions affecting research processes as well as outcomes for farmers.
5.1. Power relations shape data collection
The social dimensions of the data collection process are almost entirely absent from the evaluatory literature. In fact, the pub- lished literature says very little about the data collection process in general. For the papers based on INERA surveys, authors simply note that data were gathered via household surveys and were col- lected by ‘‘local extension agents” (Vitale et al., 2010, p. 322, 2016; Vitale &amp; Greenplate, p. 256, 2014).
The lack of discussion around how data were collected is partic- ularly worrisome given the substantial literature documenting local-level power dynamics within the Burkinabè cotton sector. Power imbalances between cotton companies and cotton farmers have been at the center of cotton farmers’ mostly unsuccessful mobilizations to gain greater power (Dowd-Uribe, 2014b; Gray, 2008). A deep sense of mistrust and ‘‘demotivation” pervades the cotton sector and interactions between cotton farmers and cotton sector employees (Diallo, 2008), where many farmers feel marginalized, unheard, and exploited. Cotton extension agents reinforce a hierarchy that systematically marginalizes and dispar-
ages poorer and smaller-scale farmers (Luna, 2019). Other research points to how cotton sector re-organizations have favored wealth- ier producers to the detriment of small and poorer producers (Gray et al., 2018).
These power dynamics likely influenced the Bt cotton data col- lection process, particularly given that ‘‘local extension agents” were apparently the main data collectors. Many farmers have var- ious reasons to mis-report farm statistics to extension agents, and may have reported these same numbers when responding to these surveys. Our research identifies several circumstances in which farmers give false accounts of cotton acreage to extension agents. For example, if a farmer reports having a big enough field, they can get a truck to pick their cotton up directly from their field, rather than having to transport and weigh their own cotton. Sec- ond, farmers who report growing more than three hectares of cot- ton qualify for corn fertilizer and get additional inputs – and some farmers over-report acreage in order to obtain additional inputs for their corn. In the opposite direction, some farmers under-report cotton acreage because they want to purchase inputs on the mar- ket rather than receive SOFITEX insecticides (which they view as inferior quality), but which are mandatory and tied to acreage. Others simply want to limit debt, and spread inputs across a wider acreage and multiple crops. While these incentives to under- or over-report cotton acreage are not necessarily rooted in power dynamics, this information is channeled through extension agents, who hold substantial influence as the gatekeepers of resources. In other words, the hierarchical relationship between farmers and extension agents shapes the kind of knowledge farmers share with extension agents, complicating the ability of extension agents to conduct accurate surveys.
These critical dynamics are not acknowledged by the evaluatory literature despite their likely impacts on data validity. These arti- cles do not discuss how the social conditions of data collection may have influenced findings, or how such dynamics were (or were not) addressed in research protocols. We should be clear that these dynamics existed for both Bt and conventional farmers (though differences may exist that we are unaware of). We do not suggest that these dynamics necessarily produced exaggerated yield claims for Bt cotton. Rather, we argue that any data collected by extension agents in this setting should be treated with consid- erable skepticism, and in the least must be acknowledged, dis- cussed, and addressed in order to produce high quality data and comparisons. Our point here is that power-laden relationships between actors in the cotton sector may have shaped supposedly objective and neutral data, yet these very relationships were left invisible and unacknowledged.
5.2. Invisibilization of structural power: the case of fertilizer
The evaluation literature also overlooked how local-level power relations and structural inequalities shape farmer outcomes. We consider this in relation to fertilizer use and, in the following sec- tion, seed costs. Fertilizer rates influence Bt cotton profitability, and fertilizer application rates vary between wealthier and poorer farmers. However, none of the Bt cotton field trials or later studies assessed how fertilizer application rates would influence Bt out- comes. By assiduously ignoring the structural differences in farm practices for wealthy and poor farmers – differences which have been established in the social scientific literature in Burkina Faso (Gray, 2005; Gray &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2013) – apolitical evaluation studies produced knowledge that likely overestimated the benefits of Bt cotton, particularly for the poorest farmers.
Cotton production is linked to fertilizer use in several key ways. First, the cotton sector is the principal form of credit for Burkinabè farmers, and the main vehicle to receive fertilizers on credit. These fertilizers are then used not only on cotton but also other crops.

They are also sold, particularly by poorer farmers, as a way to gain access to money in times of need. The uneven access to and use of manures and fertilizers have been shown to be a primary mecha- nism by which social differentiation occurs at the village-level in rural Burkina Faso (Gray &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2013), particularly when wealthier farmers are able to purchase fertilizer at discounted rates from their poorer neighbors, who fall further into debt.
Differences in synthetic fertilizer (NPK and urea) application rates likely disproportionately benefited larger and more capital- ized Bt cotton farmers. A recent study by Vognan and Fok (2019) of the differentiated impacts of Bt cotton found that less- equipped farms (those with one pair of oxen or no oxen) used less fertilizer than better-equipped farms, and that conventional cotton fields received less fertilizer than Bt cotton fields. This study also found that well-equipped Bt farms (those applying higher rates of fertilizer) had the highest yields. Previous research by Gray and Dowd-Uribe (2013) also found that wealthier/larger farms had higher yields and applied more fertilizer. Additionally, numer- ous scientists at SOFITEX, INERA, and Monsanto indicated (in 2016) that lower rates of fertilizer use had produced differentially bad out- comes for poor farmers growing Bt cotton. One senior scientist at Monsanto explained it this way:
Respondent: Following the technical itinerary (official recom- mendations for input use) is even more important with Bollgar- d2 (Bt). Given that there is less insect damage, the cotton plant produces more capsules that need to be nourished with fertil- izer, at the very minimum the amount recommended . . ... . . With conventional, the insects will pierce some of the capsules so it will take less than Bollgard.
Interviewer: Less fertilizer?
Respondent: Yes, less fertilizer than Bollgard. . ... So if the farmer doesn’t apply much fertilizer (to Bollgard), it’s true that there will be a lot of capsules, but they will be tiny.
Interviewer: And thus the yield will be low.
Respondent: Yes, exactly.
This senior scientist (along with many others) thus explained that Bt cotton was more dependent on fertilizer than conventional cotton. This respondent also explained that farmers apply one third or two thirds of recommended inputs, and that the ‘‘smallest farm- ers have the lowest yields, because they use less fertilizer.” These observations also raise the important question of whether fertilizer use, not Bt seed, was driving observed yield differences between Bt and conventional, as Kranthi and Stone (2020) argue is the case in India. According to the AICB (2015), aggregate cotton sector data recorded an average conventional cotton yield pre-2008 (pre-Bt) of 1025 kg/ha, scarcely distinguishable from their data on Bt cotton yields (1034 kg/ha) from 2009 to 2015.
Given widespread awareness among Burkinabè cotton sector employees about differences between farmers in terms of fertilizer application rates, the question emerges: why were these differ- ences never incorporated into studies carried out in conjunction with INERA and Monsanto agronomists? Why were studies not done where fertilizer application rates were varied to account for farmer practices? Again, the problem is not that cotton sector employees were unaware of these inequalities between farmers. It is more likely that these issues were not considered to be within the purview of a ‘‘scientific,” meaning strictly apolitical, assessment of the technology (Kinchy, 2012), as the dominant epistemologies of agronomy and agricultural economics (and used in corporate- funded evaluation studies) tend to overlook social and power dynamics (Sumberg, 2017). Furthermore, despite the ‘‘pro-poor” discourses attached to crops like Bt cotton, cotton sector employ- ees are rarely interested in helping the poorest farmers, and tend to focus their efforts on ‘‘professionalizing” the larger-scale farmers
who are already well-off (Dowd-Uribe, 2011; Luna, 2019). Addi- tionally, recognizing and studying inequalities between farmers may have raised potential red flags and concerns about whether Bt cotton was as beneficial as claimed, or whether the seed price was too high. While some Burkinabè scientists were concerned about these issues, these questions were not in Monsanto’s interests.
5.3. Power relations shape outcomes: the case of seed cost
Our second case of how the evaluation studies overlooked local- level power dynamics examines the standard estimates of farmers’ seed costs. Many critics of GM crops have argued that high seed costs would disproportionately hurt small farmers. Part of this argument is that in rainfed agriculture, farmers risk losing a planted field due to gaps in rainfall and may have to replant – and thus repurchase – expensive GM seeds. However, proponents of Burkina Faso’s Bt cotton adoption noted its unique ‘‘per- hectare” pricing for seeds – which, in theory, meant that if seeds did not germinate uniformly, farmers could receive additional seed free of charge to complete the seeding process. This was viewed as a significant advancement, since farmers would not have to incur additional seed costs should their seeds not germinate uniformly.
The evaluation literature used the per-hectare price in calculat- ing Bt cotton’s profitability. Most cotton sector employees inter- viewed in 2016 also stated that farmers had access to free seeds for replanting should they need them. However, here, we show how power imbalances between farmers and cotton sector employees meant that in many cases farmers in fact had to pay to get additional seed. The omission of these ‘‘hidden” but alto- gether expected additional costs resulted in overestimates of farmer gains, while obscuring the power dimensions mediating farmer outcomes. Not surprisingly, given the overall slim margins of cotton production (Gray, 2008; Gray, Dowd-Uribe, &amp; Kaminski, 2018; Luna, 2020b), farmers explained that this extra cost had dra- matic effects on the profitability and risks of Bt cotton production.
To understand why farmers ended up paying more despite a ‘‘per-hectare” policy, we need to understand the context of cotton planting and the power relations shaping the process by which farmers obtain additional seeds. There are two categories for farm- ers to order additional seeds: re-semi (replanting, in the case of seed loss) and demande complementaire (additional order, in the case of wanting more seeds to expand acreage). Both orders are made through local extension agents (ATCs). These catch-up orders are placed in a context of utmost urgency: farmers are anxious to get cotton planted early, particularly given what farmers (and Burkinabè scientists) describe as increasingly variable rainfall and pest outbreaks in the late-season. Planting time is also a criti- cal labor bottleneck for families, as children are still in school, and families are rushing to get all their fields planted (Luna, 2020b). Germination problems are thus extraordinarily stressful and time sensitive.
According to many farmers, ‘‘early on” (2009, 2010), Bt seeds for re-planting were free, and the amount of original seed provided was more generous. However, farmers said that over time the orig- inal amount of seed was reduced. SOFITEX also got stricter regard- ing re-semi orders, telling farmers that they needed to take responsibility for their actions and that oftentimes poor germina- tion was the farmers’ fault or that farmers were lying. This is where power relations became a critical mediator shaping farmers’ seed costs, with SOFITEX employees shifting responsibility for germina- tion problems onto farmers. In order for a farmer to qualify for re- semi, the farmer needed to prove a legitimate loss of seeds, with the ATC inspecting the farmer’s field to verify. However, a single ATC is responsible for hundreds if not over a thousand farmers (the farmer to ATC ratio in SOFITEX is roughly 170,000: 200, or

850:1, according to 2016 SOFITEX data). Many smaller-scale farm- ers reported that ATCs would not verify their fields in the case of seed loss. Even if the ATC came, he might say the farmer had planted at the wrong time, or the density was wrong, and it was the farmer’s fault. Rather than go through this lengthy and poten- tially humiliating process, many farmers explained that – given the urgency of planting –they either purchased more seed from another farmer or ordered seed as a demande complementaire (ex- tra seed), which was more quickly and easily available, but was added – at full price, 27,000CFA per hectare – to their debts. In other words, these farmers’ lack of power meant that they paid more. Other actors in the cotton sector suggest that re-semi requests were written down by ATCs as demande complementaire, perhaps under orders from managers to reduce the quantity of re-semi. Other actors suggest explicit corruption.
These findings indicate that Bt seeds may have significantly increased some farmers’ risk of falling into debt – above and beyond recent studies finding that farmers viewed the basic seed cost as ‘‘barely acceptable” (Fok, 2016; also see Sanou et al., 2018) and that poorer farmers faced higher risks and negative outcomes with Bt (Vognan &amp; Fok, 2019). Additional per-hectare costs would only hap- pen when a farmer lost seed and purchased additional seed, but based on 2016 interviews, this was relatively common and a wide- spread concern for farmers. When repurchasing seed, a farmer could repeatedly lose 27,000CFA per hectare in one go, which was a poten- tially greater economic risk than the risks associated with conven- tional cotton (e.g. insecticide sprays can be washed off by rain, but this does not happen to all six sprays at once).6
These findings demonstrate the critical importance of paying attention to how power relationships between actors – in this case between farmers and cotton sector employees – shape both the research process, as well as how a technology plays out for differ- ently situated actors. Evaluation studies that assume a world with- out power overlook these critical dimensions. The lack of awareness of these power relations and their effects on both the data collected, and the profitability of the technology for farmers, likely produced skewed and overly optimistic estimations of the accumulation and distribution of benefits from Bt cotton.
6. Apolitical knowledge exacerbated power imbalances
In this last section, we explore the material consequences of the evaluation literature, which bolstered a broader success narrative that reproduced and exacerbated power imbalances. In other words, the success narrative not only relied upon and invisibilized relations of power, it also served to produce material outcomes that benefited those with vested interests. Optimistic yield claims produced by early studies were used to calculate royalty prices for Monsanto, and to promote the expansion of GM crops across Africa (Schnurr, 2012, 2013).
6.1. Skewed royalty distributions
The original 2008 agreement that brought Bt cotton to Burkina Faso stipulated a distribution of benefits whereby Monsanto would gain 28% of the value added, and its Burkinabè partners (cotton companies, cotton farmers, and INERA) would receive the remain- ing 72%. This agreement relied on a number of assumptions in order to calculate the added value of Bt cotton. It assumed yield increases of 30% and a reduction of four pesticide sprays, meaning lower pesticide costs and higher yields for farmers, and more cot-
6 Furthermore, farmers had some cost flexibility with conventional cotton since they could potentially reduce insecticide sprays in the event of low pest pressure, and sell their remaining insecticide.
ton to commercialize for cotton companies. The agreement used these estimated value additions to set the Bt cotton seed price paid by farmers, and to set the royalty payments for Monsanto. Royalty payments were first based on bags of seed, and in 2011 were fixed at 26 euros per hectare of planted Bt cotton. This unusual system was designed because individual royalty contracts were deemed unfeasible.
As we have shown in this paper, this use of the 30% yield esti- mate overestimates the actual yield increase, and thus overesti- mates the value being received by Burkinabè farmers and cotton companies from Bt cotton. Thirty percent yield gains are the high- est number that emerged from pre-commercialization studies, and yet this was the number that Monsanto mobilized in calculating its own monetary benefits. Later, aggregate data from the Burkinabè cotton sector found only a 13% yield advantage of Bt over conven- tional cotton between 2009 and 2015. The Burkinabè cotton body AICB thus argued in 2015 that the 30% yield advantage number was problematic and should be revised in any future calculations of seed price or Monsanto’s royalty payments (AICB, 2015). The fact that the 30% number was used provides a clear example of how Monsanto leveraged certain types of knowledge (knowledge which was produced through a particular set of power relationships) to further their own material interests. Here cotton seed prices (as an input cost), and the politicized assumptions that go into their creation, became a site for extracting more value from farmers than stipulated in the royalty agreement. This mirrors decades of scrutiny of seed cotton (farmgate) prices paid to West African cot- ton farmers, and how the lack of transparency surrounding price setting leads to farmers receiving a proportionally smaller percent- age of the total value of their labor (see Bassett, 2014).
It is also significant to point out that Monsanto was guaranteed payment, since their payment was based on the total area planted to Bt cotton. Yield increases could be lower than 30% – and indeed they were – but this did not affect the amount of money Monsanto received. The supposed ‘‘value-added” component for farmers and the cotton companies was dependent on what we have shown to be flawed assumptions about a fixed seed cost and consistently high yield gains (and ignored issues with fiber quality).7 This means that Burkinabè cotton companies and cotton farmers shoul- dered higher risk, needing to have optimal conditions to secure their negotiated percentage of benefits (also see Fok, 2016). In effect, although Monsanto only negotiated for 28% of the value, it received a much higher proportion of the total value generated by Bt cotton. Nonetheless, Monsanto and other pro-GM advocates claimed that farmers were capturing a majority of the benefits (James, 2010; Karembu et al., 2014).
6.2. Claims of success produce success
The success narrative – which relied upon the studies we have examined in this paper – helped pave the way for the expansion of GM crops in Africa, one of the central goals for agribusinesses in the African market (Schnurr, 2013; Schurman, 2017). This was achieved via the widespread promotion of the success narrative in news articles, briefings, press coverage, and by organizing tours and visits from other African countries. Yearly reports from the pro-GM crop group ISAAA put Burkina Faso front and center as an example of the rapid and successful expansion of GM crops in Africa. These reports drew on and reproduced the problematic claims that we have analyzed in this paper to promote GM crops more broadly to other African countries.
7 According to our fieldwork, the cotton companies also had unaccounted-for expenses in trying to manage two separate seed supply systems (Bt and conven- tional), keeping the Bt seed supply uncontaminated while processing both types of cotton through the same infrastructure of trucks and ginning facilities.

Burkina Faso’s success story rapidly replaced South Africa as the principal ‘‘showcase for how GM crops can perform in the hands of African smallholders” (Dowd-Uribe &amp; Schnurr, 2016, p. 165). The Burkinabè story was used to make a case for easing restrictions on GM crops across the continent, as when it was prominently fea- tured in debates over biosafety legislation in Nigeria. Additionally, Burkina Faso regularly hosted visiting delegations from other Afri- can nations. This included ‘‘Seeing is Believing” tours, organized by Monsanto and ISAAA, in which government and agriculture sector actors from more than 17 African countries were invited to Burkina Faso to ‘‘see for themselves” the successes of Bt cotton. These tours, also organized in South Africa, were used to promote and expand the success narrative throughout Africa (Schnurr, 2012). The expli- cit aim of these tours was ‘‘that the participants will use this expe- rience to expedite the commercialization process in their respective countries for the benefit of cotton farmers” (ISAAA, 2010).
However, the information, statistics, and narratives that tour par- ticipants received came from the problematic studies we examined in this paper. In other words, these studies were not only built upon (and disguised) relations of power, but they also served to reproduce power for the biotech industry by providing a model of success for the expansion of GM crops in Africa. We should also highlight the fact that many of the visiting delegations and field tours happened ‘‘well after Burkinabè cotton sector officials knew about cotton qual- ity issues with Bt cultivars” (Dowd-Uribe &amp; Schnurr, 2016, p. 165). This underscores the disjuncture between the prominent promotion of the success narrative and the other forms of knowledge that were known, but silenced or rendered less visible.
7. Conclusion
In the context of highly politicized GM crop introductions, many scientists and politicians assert that impartial scientific knowledge should drive decision-making (Gilbert, 2013; Herring &amp; Rao, 2012). This may explain why knowledge claims have been a cornerstone of GM crop advocacy. The ISAAA home page in 2020 features the heading, ‘‘We feed the world with knowledge.” Similarly, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Undersecretary of Agriculture rhetorically asked at a 2004 GM crop conference in Burkina Faso, ‘‘What is the best thing that this con- ference can bring to Africa? Knowledge” (Traoré et al., 2014). Per- haps the central form of knowledge regarding GM crops comes from pre- and post-adoption evaluation studies, which are ostensi- bly neutral and objective. In Burkina Faso, a small set of evaluation studies produced the knowledge used to create a broader success narrative, which claimed widespread and unequivocal gains from Bt cotton.
This paper untangles the puzzling disconnect between the visi- ble success narrative that surrounded the eight years of Bt cotton production in Burkina Faso, and the less visible (and invisibilized) knowledges of uncertainty, inequality, and problems that were present all along. Our close examination of the empirical basis for the success narrative reveals narrow evaluation epistemologies and methodological shortcomings similar to other GM crop evalu- ation studies in India and South Africa (Glover, 2010a; Schnurr, 2012; Stone, 2012), with major issues of farmer selection and cul- tivation bias that undermine the empirical validity of claims made about yield and profit increases. These shortcomings alone cast doubt on success narratives built upon narrow evaluation studies.
An analysis that ends at a methodological critique, however, would miss a more careful reading of the ways in which political-economic relationships shaped (while at the same time were rendered invisible in) Burkina Faso’s Bt cotton success narra- tive. We articulated three primary connections: how material rela- tionships such as funding structures and research contracts shaped
the context of knowledge production, how the resulting knowledge production process ignored local-level dynamics that shaped data collection and farmer outcomes, and finally, how the knowledge produced by this process served to reinforce the material benefits and favorable standing of the biotech industry. Each of these ways of thinking about the relationship between knowledge and power is distinct, but together help to explain why and how the success narrative was produced and why it endured.
First, the disproportionate power held by Monsanto produced a knowledge production context conducive to favorable findings. Monsanto funded the evaluatory research. The Burkinabè research organization (INERA) which executed these studies depended heavily on this funding and was confined by a contract with Mon- santo controlling their data and findings. The research scientists carrying out this work knew that favorable results (and certain kinds of methodological choices) were an expectation. This context helps to explain how the significant issues with Bt cotton – notably the inferior lint quality and corresponding significant economic losses, but also unequal outcomes between farmers and problems with seed cost – remained largely unknown to the public for nearly ten years, until Burkina Faso announced its phase-out of Bt cotton.
Second, evaluation studies invisibilized power at the local level, despite a significant literature demonstrating how local-level dynamics shape farmer outcomes. Studies did not acknowledge, nor apparently account for, how the hierarchical position of cotton extension agents could hinder their ability to generate valid data. Furthermore, in at least two cases – fertilizer application rates and seed costs – evaluatory studies overlooked how local inequal- ities between farmers and between farmers and extension agents could significantly affect the returns accrued by Bt cotton farmers. Importantly, the invisibilization of these dynamics likely caused the evaluation literature to over-estimate Bt cotton results in gen- eral, and in particular, overstate outcomes for marginalized farmers.
Third, the success narrative that emerged from these studies was then used to improve the material benefits Monsanto accrued and bolster the position of GM crops across the continent. The highest field trial yield numbers – over two times higher than later estimates – were used to calculate Monsanto’s royalties. Monsanto was guaranteed payment and received a higher percentage of the total value added than had been originally negotiated. Further- more, ‘‘Seeing is Believing” tours were organized to promote GM crops to other African decision-makers, all while knowledge of the problems with Bt was kept silent.
This analysis is important not just because it helps explain the puzzling persistence of the Bt cotton success narrative in Burkina Faso. It also reveals the implications of the careful construction of politics-free data – what we refer to as ‘‘apolitical knowledge.” Evaluation methodologies which invisibilize politics are an episte- mological choice, born from the asymmetric power held by Mon- santo. As we have shown here, the evaluatory studies conducted in Burkina Faso were funded by Monsanto, were shaped by a con- tract stipulating Monsanto’s control over the research, and findings were sometimes published with Monsanto co-authors. Monsanto has a real material interest in findings that benefit them yet appear neutral. Narrow, quantitative economic studies that focus solely on yields while ignoring the broader social and political landscape are best suited to do this, as these kinds of quantitative studies are broadly viewed as scientific, neutral, value-free, and objective, despite the studies themselves and the objects/processes they study being thoroughly shaped by power relations. Our point here is that broader power dynamics shape the very terrain on which evaluation methodologies are chosen. In theoretical terms, power- ful actors invisibilize power in order to reproduce their power.
As numerous African countries consider GM crop approvals and new biotechnologies such as CRISPR, the issues raised in this paper

will only become more pronounced and more important to address. Many of the dynamics reported here, from the conception of research protocols, industry control over research and findings, choice of evaluation approaches, collection of data, to representa- tion of findings to a broader public, are areas of concern and require critical attention. Our analysis offers several key consider- ations for these ongoing debates and, in particular, for efforts to evaluate these new technologies.
We recommend major revisions to the current paradigm of technology evaluation studies. This means greater transparency and accountability in the reporting of data and how data are col- lected, inclusion of critical qualitative literature which explores the social dimensions of production, and the integration of findings from this literature into research protocols to reduce forms of bias. We would also urge broader (open, transparent, reflexive) discus- sions of the knowledge production process itself (Stone, 2012). If indeed GM crop organizations and advocacy groups are committed to knowledge sharing and the scientific process, they should recog- nize that knowledge is partial and contains biases, and that such partiality and bias should be the subject of examination and critical scrutiny. Moreover, we argue for the need to critically examine how power dynamics shape knowledge production as well as agri- cultural outcomes. This would involve organizations – and scien- tific disciplines – scrutinizing epistemological choices made for evaluation studies, and could lead to multiple epistemological approaches being adopted and mutually considered. They must also address the clear conflict of interest inherent in industry con- tracts which limit the independence of scientific researchers. These suggestions do not undermine science. Instead, they would help produce a more self-reflexive and transparent science that takes into account how knowledge itself is produced (Neimark et al., 2019; Robbins, 2012), and would create a more nuanced space to debate and consider the relative merits of GM crops.

  Abstract Transgenic crops have been the recipient of strong support as well as vigorously opposed opinions since their appearance. In any case, their growth throughout the world has been remarkable, and the production and commercialization of transgenics in Latin America has been especially significant. The purpose of the present study was to analyze transgenic crop production trends around the world and the relationship between the area allocated to the cultiva- tion of transgenic crops and the profits generated by this activity. Data concerning Latin American coun- tries and their participation in transgenic crop produc- tion are addressed specifically. The present study used covariance analysis, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, time series analysis, Dicker–Fuller test, Durbin–Wat- son statistic, standardization, and different measures of central tendency. Results for the period between 1996 and 2016 show that, despite the significant increase in the area planted with this type of crops,

their production presented a deterministic growth behavior, which is explained using a non-stationary model. Current data are insufficient to establish a causal relationship between cultivated hectares and their derived profits. Finally, the present study showed that production increased considerably from 2004 to 2016 in the cases of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as well as a positive relationship between the global area planted with transgenics and the corre- sponding area in these selected countries.

Introduction
Genetic modification of plants to enhance their characteristics and bring increased added value to produce began early in the history of agriculture. Genetic engineering has significantly increased the possible changes and improvements to crops; never- theless, since the introduction of genetically improved seeds, the discussion between communities in favor and against this technology has failed to move forward. Those whose opinion is favorable argue that increased production and reduced costs are ultimately beneficial to consumers. On the other hand, those who are against it are concerned about environmental and health risks (Barrows et al. 2014).

 The first account of the use of genetic engineering for commercial purposes in agriculture—an RNA- mediated gene suppression technique—dates from 1994, and it resulted in the creation of the Flavr Savr tomato. Although less money is invested on biotech- nological horticultural crops than on agronomic crops, and the economic impact of the former is still lower, relevant applications are expected in the future, and they will have to face public opinion and meet regulatory and intellectual property requisites (Chi- Ham et al. 2010; Clark et al. 2004); thus, the advancement of transgenic crops depends on how well met are various demands to guarantee its biologically safe use and the preservation of local plant species, all of which are necessary to address the concerns expressed by society.
Concerning intellectual property protection, trans- genic plant patenting schemes represent an option, but given their relevance, scientists all over the world must develop a global vision allowing for ad hoc technological management to address different related aspects, such as comprehensive protection and respon- sible transfer of such inventions, especially when the technology is transferred from developed to develop- ing economies (Koo et al. 2004; Kowalski et al. 2002). In general, the protection of intellectual property over seeds has increased significantly. In addition, market leadership is limited to a very small group of agrochemical companies, which results in high prices and insufficient capabilities to conserve these seeds among farmers (Howard 2015).
The introduction of transgenic crops into the market is always mediated by regulatory criteria, market restrictions, and compliance-associated costs (Brad- ford et al. 2005a, b). The development of biotechno- logical intellectual property and its commercialization has clearly originated in developed economies, mainly the United States, although World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries have been strong supporters of the process (Wright and Pardey 2006). As a consequence of the increasing development and consumption of transgenic crops, the discussion on their benefits and risks has intensified, particularly regarding the risks derived from inadequate manage- ment of intellectual property rights (Lo ́pez 2004). Nevertheless, given the predominance of developed countries, the introduction of transgenics in develop- ing countries must be conducted after thorough
assessments orchestrated by government actors, stake- holders, and academic peers in recipient economies.
Herring (2008) points out that, although animosity is still active around the world (genetic engineering in agriculture has not been as welcome as in other areas, for instance in medical science), several agricultural issues have already been alleviated by genetic engi- neering. Although there are still critical pending challenges (drought-resistant crops, increased produc- tivity and nutritional value, and attention to problems derived from climate change, among others), progress has been made in different countries despite contro- versy; among the most important factors blocking the introduction of transgenic crops into the market are commercial interests, problems associated with intel- lectual property, and especially political problems. Among the most critical problems identified as caused by transgenic crop development are undesired polli- nation between transgenic and conventional varieties and inadvertent planting of transgenic seeds in inten- sive crops, which entail unplanned costs for producers (Smyth et al. 2002).
Even though globally, and particularly in Europe, public opinion is reluctant to accept the production and commercialization of genetically modified crops, they have been associated with environmental and eco- nomic benefits. Most of the production is focused on a few crops with limited genetically modified charac- teristics, especially in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Canada, and Brazil, where private investments have been the vehicle for this technology to be introduced. It has also been argued that the use of noxious pesticides and herbicides has decreased significantly as a result of the increased resistance of transgenic crops. Another argument indicates that production has increased since the emergence of transgenics in number of cultivated hectares and number of countries where they are used, as well as the economic benefits derived from these activities. In addition, the new generation of transgenic crops is expected to incorporate technological upgrades and biosafety evaluation methods and to address health- related issues more extensively (increased nutritional value) (Chen and Lin 2013; Traxler 2006).
There is considerable discussion about genetic manipulation techniques and the development of transgenic crops in which biotechnology and its relationship with agriculture have been described as resulting from a neoliberal approach to food that

 imposes regulations and responds to the interests of large transnational companies; if so, governments of recipient countries have a central role in regulating biotechnology to create an adequate balance among actors. Among other issues, the discussion grapples with economic matters and legal and ethical consid- erations in which productivity becomes the central concern, and the value of transgenic crops is chal- lenged based on their social, economic, and environ- mental effects (Azadi and Ho 2010; Otero 2012). For instance, it has been argued that the commercialization of transgenic crops has been hindered by the economic burden of regulatory requirements and the barriers imposed by the market itself. Nevertheless, the field of biotechnology has acquired experience in research and commercialization activities, and its body of knowl- edge has grown; these conditions could help the industry to meet its commercialization requirements while safekeeping consumer safety (Bradford et al. 2005a, b).
In this regard, in Latin America, biotechnology firms producing food and biofuels are facing important challenges and problems in terms of food and energy safety derived from the adopted investment strategies and the incentives provided by governments and markets, which define the dynamics of the industry and its impact on society, the economy, and the environment (Saravia-Matus et al. 2018). In Latin America, the landscape of human resources training, technological and scientific infrastructure, support programs, regulation, legislation, and in general, all activities associated with biotechnology (particularly agricultural biotechnology), is markedly heteroge- neous, although the largest economies, such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Colombia, have achieved important progress (Trigo et al. 2000); therefore, mapping the configuration and evolution of the field is essential to make decisions in the sector, but especially concerning the production and com- mercialization of transgenic crops, which have a strong presence in the region. The following section demonstrates the presence of an increasing global trend, verified by its being a deterministic series and its having a sustained growth factor from 1996 to 2016. In addition, relevant data on the dynamics of transgenic crop production in certain Latin American countries are presented.
Methods
The total global area used for biotechnological transgenic crops increased from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 185.1 million hectares in 2016. This variation represents an average annual growth of 45.3 million hectares. In other words, the world has increased the territorial area allocated to transgenic produce every year between 1996 and 2016. The total worldwide variation over these 21 years was 10,788.2%. This growth has been sustained over the period and it presents a positive trend (see Fig. 1).
It is important to point out that the behavior of the total area cultivated with transgenic crops is clearly associated with time; when the covariance1 between the two variables for the period from 1996 to 2016 was calculated, the statistic indicated a result of CovðX; YÞ 1⁄4 356:7, which suggests a positive asso- ciation between the two variables. The intensity of the linear relationship was calculated for each pair of variables defined between the set of total numbers of hectares cultivated with transgenic produce (Ix) and the set defined by the years (Iu) using Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient per the following formulation:
PIxIu
q 1⁄4 qffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiqffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
 Ix Iu
P I 2x P I 2u
I 1⁄4I 􏰁I􏰂, with x xi x
Thus, the result of the statistic was qIxIu = 0.9952, which indicates a strong positive relationship of a linear nature between the global area used for planting transgenic produce and the year. Similarly, based on the calculation of qIxIu, it can be argued that the global area allocated to transgenic produce increased 99.52% for each year considered in the present study. This deterministic growth (Chandler and Scott 2011) of the global area allocated to biotechnological transgenic crops was approached using time series analysis, which demonstrated that such growth was non-stationary from 1996 to 2016. In other words, the measures of central tendency (arithmetic mean and variance) associated with the annual records are not constant over time (Shumway and Stoffer 2006;

 Leybourne et al. 2005; Fuller 1996). To verify that the series did not remain constant over time (weak stationarity)2 (Steland 2007; Rodrigues and Rubia 2008; Mirakhor and Krichene 2014; Jannati et al. 2016), we carried out Dickey–Fuller test3 for the first lag and the series tendency (Tanaka 2017; Lu et al. 2013; Guntukula 2018; Arltova ́ and Fedorova ́ 2016). The results of this test are presented in Table 1.
Results presented in Table 1 were also analyzed using Durbin–Watson statistic (D–W) = 1.978326; since the value is in the interval between dL = 1.85 and dU = 2.15, the lack of autocorrelation was vali- dated (Greene 2003). Thus, the result of augmented Dickey–Fuller test was assumed as valid: the analyzed series contains a unit root, therefore, it is non- stationary. For its part, Table 2 presents results for the proposed linear regression model, and Fig. 2 shows both estimations based on the model and real values for the global area of transgenic produce from 1996 to 2016.
2 Weak stationarity is referred to mainly because the proba- bilistic distribution associated with the series analyzed in the present study is unknown, as well as any combination of observations and all of its moments, which are time- independent.
3 Augmented Dickey-Fuller test validated the null hypothesis H0 = The series contains a unit root (series is non-stationary) over the alternative hypothesis H1 = The series does not contain a unit root (series is stationary).

Another relevant aspect to be analyzed is the cost– benefit relationship of transgenic crop production within the agricultural industry and the global value of biotechnology in the market from 1996 to 2016. Data in Fig. 3 show that each hectare used to grow transgenic crops produced an average profit of 0.07 million USD per year in the global market of crops developed using biotechnological developments dur- ing the study period. In other words, during the study period, an average of 14.86 ha produced one million USD per year on a global scale. It is also important to highlight that the behavior of these two variables was quite homogeneous throughout the period. The Pear- son’s coefficient (first order) for the correlation of the variables was calculated at 0.9904.

  measurement scales, their trends can be used to reveal which variable increased the most during the study period. To this end, data were standardized4 so that the averages of these two variables could be compared.
The standardized average global area of transgenic crops was 0.863 (Z1), and the standardized average of the global value of biotechnology (in millions of USD) in the agricultural market was 0.874 (Z2). These values allow for two assertions: (1) The net increase in both variables was indeed homogeneous, and (2) growth in both variables was positive and sustained from 1996 to 2016. However, it should be mentioned that profits derived from developments in transgenic technology

failed to present multiple dividends as expected, at least during the study period.
Despite the simultaneous increase in the global value of biotechnology (millions of USD) in the produce market and area cultivated with transgenic crops at the global scale, as observed in Fig. 2, these variables were not correlated. In other words, a larger global surface planted with transgenic crops does not necessarily lead to higher profits derived from the global value of biotechnology in the produce market.
In Table 3, the participation of some Latin Amer- ican countries in the production of transgenic crops is expressed as a percentage of global area of transgenic crops (millions of hectares) during the 1996–2016 period.
The participation of Latin American countries in transgenic cultivation, shown in Table 3, was modest during the 1996–2016 period. Brazil was the country
with the highest number of hectares planted with transgenic crops (an average of 24.94 million hectares), while Argentina grew 16.28 million hec- tares,5 Paraguay 2.77 million hectares, Uruguay 0.97 million hectares, and Mexico 0.12 million hectares. However, Argentina showed the greatest rate of growth in cultivated area allocated to transgenic crops; from 1996 to 2016, the area increased by 23,700.90%. Meanwhile, transgenic crop area increased by 1536.7% in Brazil during the 2003–2016 period, in Uruguay by 333.3% during the 2004–2016 period, and in Paraguay by 200% during the 2004–2016 period. No increase in transgenic crop area was observed for Mexico during the 2004–2016 period. These results suggest that the internal policies of some Latin American countries have been more favorable toward

  the introduction of certain transgenic crops and, as a consequence, have led to an increase in the area allocated to transgenic crops. Several measures of central tendency were calculated to understand the relationship between the behavior of global transgenic crop area and transgenic crop area per country presented in Table 3 (see Table 4).6
The covariance statistic shown in Table 4 evinces a positive relationship between the global area culti- vated with transgenic crops and the corresponding area of each selected country in Latin America.
6 The selection of Latin American countries was based on the availability of data. Information is not available for all countries or records are only available for a distinct set of years.
Additionally, these statistics show that the area planted with to transgenic crops in Brazil during the 2004–2016 period has the greatest positive linear relationship with the global area allocated to these crops. In other words, as the global area planted with transgenic crops increases, Brazil allocates a greater number of hectares for planting these crops in comparison with other countries in Latin America;
Argentina allocated the second highest number of hectares to transgenic crops, followed by Paraguay, Uruguay, and Mexico. The linear correlation between global area of transgenic crops and area allocated to transgenic crop production in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay was confirmed by Pearson correlation coefficients, which were near 1. Therefore,
 123

398

 an increase in the global area allocated to transgenic crops is confirmed, and the above mentioned Latin American countries will present a similar increasing trend in their number of hectares planted with transgenic crops.
Conclusions
At present, the advancement in production and commercialization of transgenic crops is still a controverted issue; therefore, awareness of its pro- gress and dynamics throughout the world, and in specific regions such as Latin America, becomes a relevant endeavor to understand its evolution in the agricultural sector. Additionally, insights into the industry may support many actors in making decisions based on an adequate contextualization and identifi- cation of the problems and necessities characteristic of each specific region or country. These foundations lead directly to the discussion of issues associated with biosafety, conservation of local plant varieties, bioethics, promotion of endogenous capacities and technologies, legislation, and regulation, among other matters.
Time series analysis results helped to elucidate why the growth in the area of land allocated to transgenic crops around the world was deterministic and non- stationary from 1996 to 2016. On the other hand, the analysis carried out to find out the cost–benefit relationship between the global area of transgenic crops and the global value of biotechnology (in millions of USD) in the market during the same period revealed that an increase in the global area planted with transgenic crops does not necessarily correspond to increased profits derived from the global value of biotechnology in the agricultural market.
Finally, in the case of Latin America, results indicate that the internal policies of some countries have been more benevolent to the introduction of transgenic crops, which was directly reflected in the increased area used for planting transgenics in some of these countries. In other words, there is enough statistical evidence to assert that the global increase in the area allocated to transgenic crop cultivation is associated with an increase in such area in some Latin American countries.

Worldwide CRISPR patent landscape shows strong geographical biases
A survey of the CRISPR patent landscape shows the improvement of technology, a diversity of potential sectors of application, and a new geopolitical balance of forces in the field.
On 17 August 2012 Jennifer Doudna’s group at the University of California, Berkeley and Emmanuelle
Charpentier at Umeå University and formerly at the University of Vienna highlighted the underlying molecular mechanisms of the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system1. They demonstrated
that this system can be used to produce double-stranded cuts at any precise DNA
site in prokaryotic cells by combining a
RNA guide with an endonuclease protein, CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease, or Cas9. Prior to this publication, on 25 May 2012, Berkeley, the University of Vienna
and Jennifer Doudna had filed a patent application (2012US-61652086) describing the methods and applications for this RNA-directed site-specific DNA modification. Meanwhile, groups led by
Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University2 and George Church at Harvard3 demonstrated that the CRISPR system can be used to modify eukaryotic mammalian cells, including those of humans. On 12 December 2012 the Broad Institute, MIT and Feng Zhang filed a patent application (2012US-61736527) describing the invention of mammalian genome editing.
The legal battles around these patents have attracted media attention4–6. However, as pointed out by Parthasarathy, “besides innovation protection the patent system can lead to higher prices for products, reduce people’s access to important technologies if inventors use them to establish and maintain monopolies, and can shape innovation trajectories.”7 Thus,
a CRISPR gene-editing patent landscape8
is highly desirable for reasons that go far beyond intellectual property.
We present a compilation of relevant patents in this field and have classified them to shed more light on the technical fields concerned and on the geographical origins of these patents. This unique resource can
be screened for further parameters. The data confirm that CRISPR research has continued to spread rapidly and has revolutionized
the field of genome editing. Our data also

    Box 1 | Methodology
Patents related to the CRISPR system
of gene editing were obtained from the following databases: Orbit Intelligence (https://www.orbit.com; marketed by Questel), PatentPulse (https://www. patent-pulse.com) and the open database Patent Lens (https://www.lens.org/). The search strategy was based on keywords in the following query equation: CRISPR OR Cas9 OR Cpf1 OR gRNA(s) OR sgRNA(s) OR “RNA(s) guide(d)” OR “guide(d) RNA(s)”. Searches were also performed using other nucleases (namely CAS1 to CAS10, CSY1 to CSY3, CSE1, CSE2, CSA5, CSN2, and CSM2 to CSM5) but did not yield entries not already identified using the previous searches (yielding instead many false positives due to the use of the same acronyms in different contexts). The search was limited to patent priority dates up to 31 December 2017. Patent records were listed according to the databases’ grouping as patent families (i.e., all available worldwide patent applications and granted patents considered to cover
a single invention, as defined by the Documentation Database (DocDB) simple patent family classification).
A manual cleanup of these results was performed to remove duplicates and false positives, using patent titles, abstracts, applicants, inventors, earliest priority date and technology classification codes, and the full text of the patent when necessary. Some patents that were not correctly classified automatically by the databases
as belonging to a particular patent family were identified during this cleanup and were added to their patent family. Patent families selected manually as being directly related to the CRISPR system were compiled in Supplementary Table 1 and their features were added manually in the various columns, including technological categories and subcategories, as discussed in the text. (See the Supplementary Note for examples of criteria for patent rejection or inclusion during the manual cleanup.) A manual reconciliation of inconsistently spelled and formatted assignee names was also performed to harmonize presentation and facilitate further analyses. Although initiated before the publication of guidelines by Smith et al.9, the present patenting landscape study was revised accordingly.
While technical analyses used
all publicly available patents (i.e.,
those compiled in Supplementary
Table 1), meaningful comparison of
the geographical origins of patents
must take into account that a patent application will typically be published after a delay of 18 months but there may be exceptions: namely, that in some jurisdictions the applicant can request an earlier publication. To take into account these disparities, patents with earliest priority date at least 18 months ago (i.e., up to 31 May 2017) were considered for geographical comparisons (expressed as a percentage throughout this article).

can one create an exhaustive criSPr patent list?
We searched patents related to the CRISPR system by querying three databases using criteria9 listed in Box 1, up to 31 December 2017 as a priority date. This search was first limited to the patent title and abstract to maximize the relevance of the data. Patent families (containing all patent extensions
of a given invention) were first collected in Orbit Intelligence. A thorough manual cleanup of these results was performed
614
to eliminate duplicates and false positives
as described in Box 1 (using inclusion
and exclusion criteria exemplified in
the Supplementary Note). Entries were collected similarly from two other databases (PatentPulse and Patent Lens). A manual comparison of the datasets obtained showed that Orbit Intelligence provided the largest, although not completely exhaustive, set (only 1% of the patent families were not obtained via Orbit Intelligence but were identified in at least one of the other two databases). A total of 1,469 patent families was thus compiled at the end of this first patent search step. However, to ensure maximal exhaustivity, we conducted a second search querying descriptions and claims of the patents (excluding titles and abstracts). As expected, this second search yielded many more entries (&gt;10,000), of which a large majority were false positives. A first manual cleanup removed entries
unrelated to gene editing. A second sorting separated the remaining patents into two groups using the same exclusion/inclusion criteria as for the first search. The group
of excluded patents contained 709 entries. Typically these patents focused on a new phenotype or production method for which CRISPR gene editing was simply mentioned as one possible means (among others) to implement the invention. These excluded patents, whether from the first or second search, are not further analyzed here. After removing redundancies, the second group (included patents) contained 603 patent families, which were collated with the 1,469 patent families selected from the first search. These 2,072 patent families are considered as bona fide CRISPR gene editing patents since their descriptions or claims specifically focus on a CRISPR-type system, including
a more or less detailed description on
how to use this system to implement the described invention (see the Supplementary Note for inclusion criteria for this group). Their compilation (Supplementary
Table 1) includes patent titles, abstracts, inventors, applicants, priority dates and
the various reference numbers of a given patent (including international extensions). Whether these patents and their extensions will finally be granted or not has not been included in this table since it would not
yet be known.
In summary, in such a dense patenting landscape, defining bona fide CRISPR-type gene editing inventions, is a challenging task relying on defined exclusion and inclusion criteria. Establishing such a patent list necessitated searching several databases. One cannot rely on searching titles and abstracts alone, and a careful manual cleanup of false positives is required.
In addition, proper integration of entries in their patent families is necessary.
This compilation includes the milestone patents discussed above (which can be found by searching on the patent numbers) and others that have attracted attention as part of the CRISPR-related patent struggle (see https://www.broadinstitute.org/crispr/ journalists-statement-and-background- crispr-patent-process), including those rejected by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) (e.g., Northwestern University’s application 2008US-61099317 and ToolGen’s application 2012US- 61717324).
criSPr patent distribution: a diversity of fields but a strong geographical bias Supplementary Table 1 also compiles the country of invention and reveals that CRISPR patents were originally filed by
28 countries (Fig. 1a). The United States NAture BiotechNology | VOL 37 | JUNE 2019 | 601–621 | www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology

   and China lead with 872 and 858 patents, respectively. Strikingly, European countries as a whole filed only 194 such patents, followed by the Republic of Korea
(75 patents) and Japan (48 patents). Twenty-six patents were co-deposited by inventors from the United States and other countries (Switzerland (6), Japan (4), the Netherlands (3), Germany (2), Russia (2), Austria (1), Belgium (1), Canada (1), China (1), France (1), Israel (1), New Zealand
(1) and the United Kingdom (1). Six
patents were co-deposited by other pairs
of countries (China/Israel, China/United Kingdom, China/Taiwan, Denmark/Canada (2), and Switzerland/Germany).
To evaluate more accurately the respective weight of each country, it is necessary to take into account the delay of 18 months before publication of a patent (see Box 1) and the fact that many Chinese patents were actually published before this delay, thus artificially increasing their weight in Supplementary Table 1. Therefore, we compared patent numbers per country at two different time points (Fig. 1a). One
was priority date 31 December 2017, which actually reflects those patents publicly available on 30 November 2018, the latest update of Supplementary Table 1. The second is priority date 31 May 2017, the most recent date for accurate geographical comparisons since it takes into account the 18-month delay in publication with respect to the latest update of Supplementary
Table 1. At this latter time point, inventors from the United States had filed 47.8% of the patents, China 34%, Europe 10.4%, the Republic of Korea 3.8% and Japan 2.6%. Thirty-three percent of these patents
(up to 31 May 2017) were deposited by private firms.
Patenting rate per year (Fig. 1b)
shows that the United States had an
early leadership, as expected, but that
the patenting rate from China is steadily increasing. In this criterion, China took the lead over the United States in 2016.
As previously shown8, major patent holders in the United States include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT; 113 patents), Harvard College
(109 patents, 34 co-deposited with MIT), the Broad Institute (86 patents, most of them co-deposited with MIT), the University of California (73 patents) and Editas Medicine (43 patents). We further find that China takes an important place in this ranking:
the Chinese Academies of Sciences and Agricultural Sciences (182 patents filed), China Agricultural University (35), Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences (27), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (24), Sun Yat Sen University (17), University of
Beijing (17) and Second Peoples Hospital of Shenzen (14). Regarding private firms well known for their marketing of transgenic products, we note that DuPont-Pioneer filed 20 patents, Monsanto 4, Bayer 1 and Syngenta 1.
To refine this patenting landscape from a technical point of view, we manually sorted these patents into various categories (see color codes in Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). It was obvious that many patents describe technical improvements at large
in the CRISPR system, which could potentially be used for many practical purposes. Thus, we classed such patents
in a ‘technical improvements’ category, which contains 942 out of the 2,072 patent families. A second important category relates directly to medical purposes. Other patents describe industrial applications or agricultural applications; the latter can be subdivided as either related to plants or farm animals/aquaculture. An additional
set of patents were classed in a category describing ‘other in vitro use’ of components of the CRISPR system (for example, DNA assembly, splicing, analysis, isolation or linker removal, or Cas9 assays). Using this type of categorization, only 7 patents were allocated to two categories (identified in Supplementary Table 1 by a gradient in the corresponding color codes).
A technological field still in quest of technological improvements Admittedly, there is a certain level of subjectivity in this classification since
all CRISPR patents can be considered
as providing ‘technical improvements.’ However, patents included in this category focus their claims on general methods
(often for research), while patents with claims directly related to one of the above- mentioned specific applications (i.e., medical, industrial or agricultural) were excluded. Inclusion and exclusion selection criteria are exemplified in the Supplementary Note.
The United States not only has been a pioneer in gene editing using CRISPR but
is still a leader for improvements of this technical development, with 479 patents compiled in this category (Fig. 2b). China is the second largest depositor (306 patents), while European countries again trail with only 91 such patents. Some patents were co-deposited by inventors from the United States and from other countries: Japan (4 patents), Switzerland (4), the Netherlands (2), Austria (1), France (1), and Germany (1). One patent was co-deposited by Switzerland and Germany, and 1 patent by China and Thailand. When patents in this category are compared up to the priority date of 31 May 2017 (Fig. 2b), the respective
weights of the United States, China and Europe are 57%, 24.9% and 10.5%. The private sector filed 32% of these patents (up to 31 May 2017).
By nature, this category is diverse, and it merited further sorting into subcategories (see Supplementary Table 1 and its color codes). They consist of either general methods for improving CRISPR–Cas9- mediated genome editing, without species restriction, or those linked to a given species or a group of species (namely, mammals including humans, fish, other animals, fungi, microalgae or prokaryotes) or to mitochondria, or methods to favor either knockout or homologous types of editing, or chromosome translocation. Other subcategories were created as follows. Although most patents in the previous subcategories include methods for delivery to cells, some patents specifically focus
on improvements of such delivery. Other patents describe Cas9 variants or the use
of other nucleases (including Cpf1) or improvements in the guide RNAs and multiple gene editing (multiplexing). Importantly, some patents claim the reduction of off-target editing (or detection of off-target editing). Other applications are also described, such as epigenome editing, RNA editing or other miscellaneous uses (including genomic screening and gene detection, cell sorting, and gene drive).
Patents filed before the milestone inventions mentioned in the first paragraph above were also included as a subcategory (termed ‘early development’ in Supplementary Table 1). These include descriptions of Cas nucleases, guide
RNA delivery vehicles, or use of CRISPR sequences. Included in this subcategory
is Vilnius University’s patent (2012US- 61613373) describing in vitro “RNA- directed DNA cleavage by the Cas9-crRNA complex” (which was filed just before the Berkeley patent mentioned above).
Note that we have chosen to include technical improvements directly related to agricultural organisms (131 patent families) as a subcategory in the agricultural category for reasons explained below. However, when added to the ‘technical improvement’ category, the total number of patents in the latter category is then 1,073 patents out of 2,072 in Supplementary Table 1.

   classification of diseases (http://www.who. int/classifications/icd/en/) are concerned with CRISPR technology patents (see color codes in Supplementary Table 1). Cancer alone represents 131 patent families,
of which 31 describe immunotherapy approaches (for example, using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T lymphocytes10) for selectively eliminating cancerous or other pathogenic cells. Fifty- nine patent families on cancer applications of CRISPR technology were filed by China, dominated by the public sector (Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities, and research institutes). It is important to note the recent creation of around 15 Chinese private firms (such as Anhui Kedgene Biotechnology, Biotowntek, Chengdu Keli Bo Biotechnology, Chongqing Gaosheng Biological Pharmaceutical, Guangzhou Huiyuanyuan Pharmaceutical Technology, Nanjing Kaidi Biotechnology and Yuan Biotechnology) that have filed patents concerning cancer applications of CRISPR technology since June 2015. The United States ranks second in filing cancer patents (54 patent families), mainly represented
by universities or research institutes, but also by private firms such as Agenovir,
Batu Biologics, Editas Medicine, Intima Bioscience, Juno Therapeutics, Grail, Nantomics, Nuon Therapeutics and Sandia Corporation. Europe is represented only by Denmark (1 patent filed by Frost Habib), France (4 patents filed by Cellectis, 1 patent filed by Inserm/Rennes and Bordeaux Universities/Institut Bergonié), Germany
(1 patent filed by Amgen Research Munich), Switzerland (1 patent co-deposited
with US Novartis/Intellia Therapeutics) and the United Kingdom (1 patent filed by PhoreMost).
One hundred and twelve patents in Supplementary Table 1 describe methods for treating viral infections: cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, herpes simplex,
HIV, human papilloma virus, human T-cell leukemia virus, influenza B, polyomavirus, varicella zoster and Zika virus. An often- used strategy is the ex vivo modification
of T cells to knock out the CCR5 gene, resulting in resistance to HIV infection.
Out of the patents claiming treatment of viral diseases using CRISPR technology,
62 originated from the United States,
well distributed between the public sector (with Temple University alone holding
18 patents) and private sector (Agenovir,
11 patents; Editas Medicine, 7 patents; Excision Biotherapeutics, 6 patents; Nantomics, 1 patent). Forty-one such patents originate from China, mostly
filed by the public sector, but also
by private firms such as Biotowntek,
Guangdong Chi Meng Medical Technology, Guangzhou Zeesan Biotechnology, Shanghai Jie Yi Biotechnology, Shanghai Jinwei Biotechnology and Wuhu Inno Biotechnology. Only five other countries are included in this subcategory: France (Cellectis, 3 patents; Inserm/Nantes University, 1 patent), Canada (Protiva Biotherapeutics, 1 patent), Japan (Aichi Prefecture, 1 patent), the Republic of Korea (Yonsei University, 1 patent) and Russia (Federalnoe Byudzhetnoe Uchrezhdenie Institute Epidemiologii, 1 patent).
Other patents describe gene therapy methods, such as gene replacement in somatic cells. They concern Alzheimer’s disease and other nervous system disorders, such as Huntington’s disease, autism and psychiatric diseases; autosomal dominant diseases; blood diseases (for example, β-thalassemia and anemia); diseases of
the musculoskeletal system (for example, bone diseases and rheumatoid arthritis) and muscular dystrophies (for example, Duchenne’s disease); nucleotide repeat disorders; and retinal or other ocular diseases (for example, glaucoma). Some patents describe induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) modifications for
ex vivo therapy11.
Other patent claims include gene
knockout use—for example, to treat allergic, endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (diabetes, cystic fibrosis, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, obesity, etc.), to prevent coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and other cardiovascular disease, to destroy senescent cells, or to target metastasis-related genes. Still other patents concern treatment of infection by resistant bacteria. Some patents claim improved delivery to cells of gene editing components, or transplantation improvements.
The United States and China again dominate these medical patent subcategories (excluding cancer or virus applications), with 134 and 113 patents filed, respectively. As in the cancer and virus subcategories,
the United States and China are represented mainly by public research institutes or universities, but also by private firms, such as Editas Medicine, Sangamo Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics (United States) and Beijing Biocytogen, Generos Biopharma
and Suzhou Tongshan Biotechnology (China). Forty-five such patents were filed by European countries, mostly represented by Switzerland, with 33 patents filed (CRISPR Therapeutics, 29 patents for several neurological, blood and metabolic diseases; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, 1 patent for Huntington’s disease; University of Basel, 1 patent on cell
therapy; University of Lausanne, 1 patent
for DNA-triplet repeat diseases; Novartis/ Intellia Therapeutics (co-deposited with the United States), 1 patent for blood disease). The Republic of Korea has 19 patents recently filed by members of the public and private sectors, concerning a wide range of diseases (Industry Academic Cooperation Foundation, Institute for Basic Science, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Moogene Medi, MGEN Plus, Seoul National University Hospital, Toolgen and Yonsei University). Canada is also represented, with 8 patents (University of Laval, Hospital for Sick Children and Protiva Biotherapeutics) concerning neurological and muscular diseases and delivery of CRISPR therapeutics.
In addition, 187 patent families in the subcategories ‘mammals, including humans’ or ‘knockout technique (mammals)’ of the above-mentioned ‘technical improvements’ category of Supplementary Table 1 may have implications for human health (although less direct ones, hence their classification as ‘technical improvements’). This also holds true for a subcategory in the ‘industrial applications’ category (see below) describing a number of pharmaceutical applications (65 patent families). These health-related subcategories can be identified by the same color code as the patents in the ‘medical’ category in Supplementary Table 1. Taking into account all these patents leads to a noteworthy number of 806 patent families out of 2,072 directly or indirectly related to human health.
industrial applications for criSPr
Industrial applications of the CRISPR system through metabolic engineering have been reviewed12. In our compilation, this category contains fewer patents (167 patent families; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1) than the previous ones, likely because it often involves microorganisms for which there are many other effective methods of genome modification, including homologous recombination. These microorganisms are either fungi or bacteria (Lactobacillus buchneri, Riemerella anatipestifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Salmonella, Streptomyces virginiae).
Patent claims include the identification of serotypes, growth of microorganisms and suppression of resistance to antibiotics, biofuel production or increased production of molecules of interest. Two patents classed in an ‘aroma/taste’ subcategory involve mammalian cells: one, filed from Switzerland, describes the use of human embryonic kidney cells to functionally express odorant receptor proteins on the cell surface for high-throughput screens of

  volatile flavor and fragrance compounds, and another, filed from Germany, describes the activation of taste receptor genes in mammalian cells. Use of animal cells is
also described for manufacturing skeletal muscle for dietary consumption, as well as a method using edited mouse or human cells as part of a kit for detecting pyrogen, and even the production of hypoallergenic cats. Some patents are also related to silk production. Pharmaceutical applications (65 patent families) relate to the production of antibodies, vaccines or other products; a majority, 31 patents, originated from China, and only 18 from the United States, 7 from Europe, 6 from the Republic of Korea, 1 from Israel, Japan, and Singapore. Nine patents are related to nutrition: 5 from China, 2 from the United States and 2 from the Republic of Korea.
Examining all patents in this ‘industrial’ category shows that they originated from China, the United States, Europe and six countries from elsewhere in the world (Fig. 2d). When comparing up to 31 May 2017 as a priority date (148 patents), China leads this category (38.5%), followed by the United States (33%), while patents of European origin represent only 15.5% (of which Denmark alone contributes 5.4%). One patent was co-deposited by inventors from the United States and New Zealand. Private firms filed 34.5% of these patents.
criSPr patents in relation to agricul- tural organisms
Since the GMO controversy has largely limited agricultural applications of biotechnology and is similarly threatening CRISPR use13, we decided to analyze,
as a distinct category of patents in Supplementary Table 1, those related either to ‘farm animals,’ including aquaculture
(a total of 85 patent families), or to ‘plants’ (267 patent families). Only 5 of the plant patents have a dual categorization (3 in both ‘plants’ and ‘medical,’ 1 each in both ‘plants’ and ‘farm animals’ and in both ‘plants’
and ‘technical improvements’). CRISPR patents in relation to agricultural organisms appeared from September 2012 for plants (Dow Agrosciences/Sangamo Biosciences) and from February 2014 for farm animals and aquaculture (Qingdao Institute of Animal Husbandry Veterinary Medicine). As expected, the number of such patents published since has grown steadily: 11 in 2013, 35 in 2014, 63 in 2015, 112 in 2016 and 128 (data incomplete) in 2017.
As mentioned above, some patents describe general ‘technological improvements,’ that is, those not linked to a precise applied goal, but which nevertheless can relate to a given species (predominantly
pigs for animals, but also cows, buffalo, goats, sheep, chickens, birds and fish, and mainly rice for plants but also 11 other
plant species). The reason for not grouping these agricultural technical improvements with the above-mentioned ‘technological improvement’ category is that agricultural biotechnologies may be more controversial than other biotechnologies, and this could translate in differential involvement of countries. Some other patents without direct agricultural application, such as the use of plants for molecule production or specific metabolic changes, or as a research model (Arabidopsis, barley and rice) were also grouped in the ‘plants’ category.
The largest plant subcategory describes direct claims for plant breeding (130 patents), with rice being dominant
(64 patents). Only 11 patents were filed
for maize, 5 for wheat, 4 for tomato, 3 for potato, 2 for tobacco and 1 each for cotton, nut grass, oilseed plants, sorghum, and pasture plants. These patents concern male sterility (16 patents), herbicide tolerance (6 patents), virus resistance or detection
(9 patents, including 1 for detection and 2 for tobacco and tomato), fungi, bacteria and pest resistance, plant stature or architecture, flowering time, pollination and fertility parameters, plant aging and fruit shelf-life, haploid breeding, seed quality or shattering, metabolic changes, yield, stress resistance and plant crossing. Considering the potential of genome editing for improved animal breeding14, it was to be expected that the largest animal subcategory also relates
to breeding (50 patents), with pigs being dominant (22 patents), followed by sheep (12 patents), mammals in general
(5 patents), fish (4 patents), birds (3 patents), goats (2 patents), cows and rabbits (1 patent each). Applications concern fertility, meat production, milk quality, resistance to various diseases including viruses, and
sheep wool color.
The geographical origins of these patents are shown in Fig. 2e. Upon analysis up to the priority date of 31 May 2017 (215 ‘plants’ patents and 64 ‘farm animal’ patents),
China leads the plant category (60.5%), followed by the United States (26%), while patents of European origin represent only 8% (17 patents, of which Germany and the Netherlands contributed 6 and 5 patents, respectively). Japan and the Republic of Korea represent 2.3% each (5 patents). For farm animals, China leads with 87.5%, with 8% for the United States and a single patent each for Australia, Israel, Japan and the United Kingdom. Three patents for ‘plants’ were co-deposited respectively by inventors from China and the United Kingdom, from Denmark and Canada, and the United States
and the Netherlands. One was co-deposited for ‘farm animals’ by inventors from the United Kingdom and United States. Private companies filed 27% and 5% of these ‘plant’ and ‘farm animal’ patents, respectively. Private companies with the most deposits are DuPont-Pioneer (United States; 12 patents), KWS Saat (Germany; 5 patents), Keygene (the Netherlands; 4 patents), Dow Agrosciences (the United States; 3 patents) and Beijing DBN Technology (China;
3 patents). Public depositors are mostly represented by Chinese public organizations: China Agricultural University and the Institute of Genetics and Development Biology/Chinese Academy of Sciences
(14 patents each), Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences (11 patents) and the Institute of Crop Science/Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (10 patents).
The University of California is the most important US depositor for agricultural sector, with 9 patents filed.
Discussion
The CRISPR system is at the center of a growing influx of patented inventions. Compiling all CRISPR-related patents is of obvious importance for industrial strategical planning and other reasons discussed below, but has proven excessively difficult. The method described here for CRISPR patent compilation highlights the challenges of reaching exhaustivity. Consequently, most previous CRISPR patent compilations have relied on a small subset of such patents. The present compilation independently yielded a patent family number close to that of Egelie et al.8 up to 2015, and extended the list up to the 31 December 2017 priority date (as publicly available on 30 November 2018). A second challenge, of a semantic nature, concerns the definition of a bona fide CRISPR-related gene editing invention: many patents seem to mention CRISPR and other related keywords to extend the scope of their claims, although the technology itself is not central to the described invention. Therefore, our detailed analysis focused on what we considered bona fide CRISPR patents: namely, ones whose claims specifically focus on a CRISPR-type system to implement the invention (see our criteria in the Supplementary Note).
A more detailed analysis of these patents revealed a rush to improve the technology itself (942 patent families out of a total
of 2,072), while other patents claimed a direct, specific applied purpose. Therefore, we classed the first group as general ‘technical improvements’ and subdivided the other CRISPR patents as directly related to medical purposes, to industrial (including pharmaceutical) applications,
618
NAture BiotechNology | VOL 37 | JUNE 2019 | 601–621 | www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology

feature
   or to agricultural purposes, following the criteria explained above. Such a separation is inevitably a matter of interpretation, but
a classification into categories and then into subcategories appeared useful to highlight the diverse applications of CRISPR gene editing. Note that Supplementary Table 1 contains specific color codes which help
the visualization of related patents despite the fact they were classed in different categories (for example, for health, medical and pharmaceutical patents share the same color code; farm animal and plant patents with technical improvements share the same color code as the technical improvements category). It should also be noted that the categorization chosen here on a technical basis is not at odds with our geographical comparison (for example, ‘medical’ patents are dominated by the United States, while ‘industrial’ patents are dominated by China, as are pharmaceutical patents, which we chose to add to this ‘industrial’ category).
In our opinion, these inventions are
also revolutionizing the plant and animal breeding sectors. Note, for example,
that CRISPR patents involve polyploid organisms such as wheat (resistance to a geminivirus) or autopolyploids such as
carp (resistance to KH virus). However, the CRISPR system still has limitations. Our study shows that, to date, the modifications concern primarily single-gene characters, which are often inactivated (by knockout
of the responsible gene). However, some patents do describe gene insertion or gene overexpression (for example, by insertion
of a particularly strong promoter or intervention on regulators or promoters, such as the suppression of an interfering RNA). Although the CRISPR system is
very effective for this type of operation, the number of interesting monogenic traits to be modified for agriculture remains limited. Indeed, most characters of an organism
are controlled by a multitude of genes (and with quantitative effects), and, as such, the CRISPR system cannot effectively act on the character given the present state of art, as a better knowledge of the relevant genes is required. In this context, we note that while the keywords “knockout” or “knock- out” appear 28 times in the ‘plants’ category (Supplementary Table 1; titles and abstract alone), “multiplexing” or “multi-target” (i.e., the simultaneous modification of several loci of the same genome) appear only 4 times, highlighting the further necessity for technical improvements.
The current licensing strategy of various companies regarding patents in the CRISPR field has already been analyzed12 and will not be discussed here. The fact that this molecular chisel operates directly on the
genome raises ethical issues that will affect the development of CRISPR research and the publication of patents, particularly
in animals (http://nuffieldbioethics.org/ project/genome-editing). Regarding public health, Sherkow argued that health-related patents may contribute to high prices for novel therapies, which may limit their availability for patients and may also lead to the allocation of research and development resources to profitable diseases15. The
same author also discussed the ethical implications of CRISPR patenting16 and “lessons about science and society”17. The present compilation and further updates will allow documented discussions about these ethical issues.
Obviously, the regulatory status of gene- edited organisms will influence further developments of the technology. The recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union that precise gene-editing technologies, such as CRISPR–Cas9, would not be exempted from European GMO law will be detrimental to this respect18. Their marketing as GMOs will be very costly
and be subject to political opposition. This will limit public laboratory research, which resulted in most CRISPR patents to date (1,344 patent families out of 2,072; 70 by individuals and 64 by both public and private sectors).
More and more voices are asking for
a revision of the current European GMO Directive13. However, our present analysis shows that the damage has already been done in Europe: the number of CRISPR patents originating from this continent
is trailing far behind those of the United States and China. This trend concerns all patent categories defined here, including those related to health (despite the fact that it is not the most controversial). Rodríguez-Navarro and Narin showed
that “Europe lags far behind the USA in the production of important, highly cited research.”19 They concluded that “there
is a consistent weakening of European science,” which they attribute to the funding systems. The problem may be more widespread and could be attributed to a hostile cultural (“precautionary”) climate against innovations, including biotechnology20. It would be a delusion not to consider the GMO bans in Europe as having had a strong negative impact on the future of biotechnology on the continent (including in relation to health aspects). The definition of what is patentable (which includes “ethical” considerations) in Europe versus in other parts of the world may also add to European cultural naivety in the current economic competition. The cost of EU patent protection was estimated
to be 18–20 times more than in the United States. Although this may no longer be the case with the new European unitary patent system21, a reluctance to file patents may persist for all the above-mentioned factors. Whatever their relative contributions, an overall consequence is a long-term trend of patent numbers for all types of patents granted by the European Patent Office to trail far behind the number granted by
the USPTO (http://www.wipo.int/edocs/ pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_941_2017.pdf). Thus, the differential trend in the US versus Europe in the case of CRISPR was not unexpected.
Regarding China, its patent office surpassed the European Patent Office in 2005 and the USPTO in 2011 in terms
of patents granted per year. In addition, Chinese patent owners are overwhelmingly Chinese, while the ratios between ‘resident’ and ‘non-resident’ are about equal for
the European Patent Office and USPTO (see link above). However, it was unexpected that this general trend
would reflect in CRISPR patents so soon: previous CRISPR patent landscapes have considered geographical aspects8,12,22,
but to our knowledge none have pointed out that China has taken the lead over the United States in terms of patents per year. This can be explained by China’s massive investment in biotechnology. One example (in the agricultural field) of a technical incentive for China’s investment could be the national importance of pig farming and rice cultivation, and the fact that they are threatened by diseases and pests. It
is also likely to be the product of China’s new patenting strategy. China issued its first patent law in 1984 and revised it in 1992, 2000, 2008 and 2016 (http://www. ipwatchdog.com/2015/12/18/chinese- patent-law-amendments-proposed/ id=63981/). China enacted a patent
system that can be considered an economic protectionist tool23. The essentially domestic purpose of their patents is corroborated by the fact that Chinese CRISPR patents are rarely extended
to other countries. In a dense patent landscape, foreign companies operating
in this field could be deterred from exporting to China, or at least would
have to pay royalties to access the
Chinese market.
In conclusion, this compilation and classification of CRISPR-type gene editing patents worldwide shows an impressive stream of highly diverse applications and an unexpected switch in the balance of forces in favor of China, while providing no indication that Europe, which has lost the GMO battle, is in a position to regain

  its footing in this new biotech battlefield. The information provided here makes it possible to identify key inventors, to identify the most prolific actors, and to further analyze innovative environments. It could be complemented by analyzing the maturity of the technology, the strategic trajectories of the actors in the field and the strategic trajectories of those who fund these actors. It also remains to be determined how many of these patents will actually be exploited. Since many inventions listed here are improvements of prior inventions, it will interesting to see how these improvement patents lead to litigation, especially in the context of the legal battle surrounding the original inventions. Regulation should ideally be particularly responsive to adapt

            <Text> GM food and crops: what went wrong
in the UK?
Many of the public’s concerns have little to do with science
Derek Burke
Genetically modified (GM) crops are now being grown extensively in North and South America and
China, although not in Europe. Food pro- duced from these crops has become a part of the normal diet in North and South America and in China, but not in Europe, where contention continues despite the fact that millions of US citizens eat GM soya without any ill effects in a very liti- gious society, and many Europeans have eaten GM soya while in the US without any adverse consequences.
European consumers’ continuous and ardent opposition to GM crops and foods has had serious repercussions for plant research, for the commercial develop- ment of new crops and, most importantly, for developing countries that could bene- fit most from GM crops. Several countries in Africa and elsewhere have resisted growing such crops, mainly for fear of being unable to export them to the European market (The Economist, 2002). It is therefore worthwhile to investigate what actually went wrong in the debate about GM food and crops in Europe and how these foods have earned such a bad name. Such an analysis could not only help to overcome public fears of this
technology, but also help scientists and policy makers to address similar concerns in the future, such as the growing debate over nanotechnology.
The concerns of European consumers about the potential health and envi- ronmental threats of GM crops have resulted in an unprecedented effort to investigate those anxieties and communi- cate with the wider public, particularly in the UK, where the use of public consulta- tion has been extensively developed. The first of these initiatives was the extensive Farm Scale Evaluations of three GM crops (herbicide-resistant beet, oil seed rape and maize), whose results were published last year (Firbank, 2003 and articles cited within; Turner, 2004), followed by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment’s report to the UK govern- ment (ACRE, 2004). There has also been a major review of the science relevant to GM crops and food, chaired by the Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government (GM Science Review, 2004). In addition, the UK Agricultural, Environmental and Biotechnology Commission has produced a series of reports on the scientific, social and ethical implications of sowing GM crops (www.aebc.gov.uk). The Nuffield Council on Bioethics’ paper on ‘The use of genetically modified crops in develop- ing countries’ (2004) reaffirmed its earlier conclusion that “there is an ethical oblig- ation to explore these potential benefits responsibly, in order to contribute to the reduction of poverty and to improve food security and profitable agriculture in
developing countries” (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 1999). Finally, the British Medical Association recently stated in its report ‘Genetically modified foods and health’ (BMA, 2004) that “The BMA shares the view that there is no robust evi- dence to prove that GM foods are unsafe” and that “genetically modified food has enormous potential to benefit both the developed and developing world in the long term.”
The British government has now made a decision on the basis of this mass of evi- dence. On March 9 this year, Margaret Beckett MP, UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, made a statement in the House of Commons saying inter alia that “There was no scientific case for ruling out all GM crops or products” (Beckett, 2004) and announced agreement in principle to the commercial cultivation of GM herbicide- tolerant maize, subject to some condi- tions. Beckett further said that “There is no scientific case for a blanket approval of all uses of GM, and equally there is no scien- tific case for a blanket ban on the use of GM,” although she took into account pub- lic concerns. “Most people believe that the use of genetic modification should be approached with caution. They want strong regulation and monitoring and in addition, some want a framework of rules for coexistence of GM and non-GM crops, and customers want a clear regime for traceability and labelling so that they can make their own choices.”
This was all to no avail. On March 31, Bayer CropScience (Monheim, Germany)

  announced that it was giving up attempts to commercialize its GM maize in the UK—the only transgenic plant approved for widespread cultivation (Mason, 2004). The company explained that its herbicide- tolerant maize variety Chardon LL had been left “economically non-viable” because of the conditions imposed by the Govern- ment on its growth in the UK. After the Farm Scale Evaluation trials showed that it caused less damage to wildlife than con- ventional varieties, Beckett had given the crop limited approval, but had not yet decided rules for mixing GM and non-GM crops, and for compensation for “contami- nation” by GM pollen. Bayer pointed out that Chardon LL had been developed for approval in 1999, but in the interim had lost its competitive edge against rival vari- eties as the controversy over GM crops continually slowed its introduction. It also warned that the UK’s tough regulations on GM plants could put at risk the adoption of this new technology.
Bayer’s decision to withdraw Chardon LL from the UK and other European mar- kets means that UK farmers will not grow GM crops until GM oil seed is approved for cultivation; this will not be before
2008. The moral is obvious: States that procrastinate and prevaricate over new technologies lose it. Decisions such as this will only accelerate the flight of both sci- entists and companies from the EU to countries that are more accepting of new technologies.
So, despite all these scientific activities, there is still considerable antipathy to the introduction of GM crops and food. Why has the British public, who normally so pragmatically welcome scientific advances, resisted the introduction of genetically modified crops? What went wrong in the past few years and what lessons can we learn from this experience that might be helpful elsewhere in Europe and in future debates about new technologies?
In fact, the British public has not been proactive on the GM question. It does not crop up spontaneously either in gen-
eral polls about voting issues, or in more detailed questionnaires about family and social matters. One recent consumer sur- vey (FSA Public Attitudes to GM, 2002) commented that “In normal circum- stances, GM [is] very far down the list of considerations with regard to food; [it] is a
tiny feature on the mental map of food issues, [and] does not figure at all for some”, while GM safety was not among the top ten sources of information most used when selecting food. During the ‘GM Nation? The Public Debate’ (2004), the website received interest from only 0.035% of the population and letters and emails from 0.0002% (Myram, 2004). When people were asked whether they are in favour of GM foods or planting GM crops, 36% answered “No”—with 13% supportive and 39% neither for nor against—so it might be better to describe the public as unpersuaded by the benefits (Poortinga &amp; Pidgeon 2004; Cordon, 2004). However, in another survey (Consumer Watch, 2003), only 13% of consumers said they actively avoid foods with GM ingredients, while 13% said they would welcome these products on the supermarket shelves, and 74% were not sufficiently concerned about GM food to actively avoid it. It was not seen as a priority when compared with other aspects of the purchase decision. It seems as if consumers prefer to go along with what appears to be the easiest course, which in this case is a precautionary approach. This attitude, dri- ven in part by the press, campaign groups and government equivocation, is indeed resistance, but it is important to emphasize that it is not public-led.
It is also puzzling that there has never been any public concern about the fact that, for the past 50–60 years, plant breed- ers have used chemical and radiation mutagenesis to create new varieties, involving major and quite unknown genetic modifications followed by selection of useful outcomes. So why is there so much opposition now? It is as if GM is a light- ning rod for a whole series of consumer concerns, already present but unexpressed. Let me suggest some of them.
Consumers assess risk in a different way to scientists. The technical def- inition of risk is ‘the likelihood of
adverse consequences from any hazard’, but that is not the way the public sees risk. It does not explain why some risks trigger so much more alarm, anxiety or outrage

 than others, seemingly regardless of scien- tific estimates of their seriousness. Research over many years has identified several ‘fright factors’, which affect the way the public sees risk (Bennett, 1999). People are generally more worried if they perceive a risk to be involuntary, for example, exposure to pollution, rather than voluntary, such as smoking. Risks are also seen as more serious if they are inequitably distributed, inescapable by taking personal precautions, if they arise from an unfamiliar or novel source or if they cause hidden and irreversible dam- age. Danger to small children, pregnant women or future generations also arouses particular dread, as does the possibility of certain forms of death, injury or illness. Risks are perceived to be more threatening if they damage identifiable rather than anonymous victims. Finally, public fears also increase if the issue seems to be poorly understood by science and is subject to contradictory statements from responsible sources. GM soya scored positively on many of these factors.
One explanation for conflicting views about GM is that scientists and the public work under different value systems. Scientists and technologists see novel applications from new discoveries as logi- cal and reasonable, and characterize all opposition as unreasonable: “If only they understood what we are doing, the public would agree with us.” This is often untrue. Indeed, the public’s reaction to risk is often rather different to that of scientists, and can occur as outrage (the way the public regards Monsanto), dread (as many would regard a nuclear power station explosion) and stigma (the way the public regards food irradiation).
Peter Sandman, an expert on risk com- munication at Clark University (Worcester, MA, USA) points out that the risks the experts think will cause problems are not usually the risks that upset people (www.psandman.com). He outlines four traditional responses to public fears: the conservative’s answer is that the public is stupid and irredeemably irrational on risk issues, so we must protect public health but ignore public opinion; the liberal’s
answer is that the public is educatable but ignorant, so we must explain the data bet- ter; the company’s answer is that the pub- lic is manipulated by sensational mass media or radical activist groups, so we must fight the propaganda battle better; the activist’s answer is that the public is right—the experts have been misled or bought off—so we must base public policy on public opinion.
Sandman thus suggests a new way to look at risk: experts respond to hazards, but the public responds to outrage. Experts often define risk as probability multiplied by consequences. In contrast, Sandman defines risk as hazard plus outrage. Scientists may wonder why the public responds as it does to some risk issues— and it is usually caused by outrage. It is therefore not possible to predict how the public will react to new risks by consulting only scientists and technologists; percep- tion of risk is as important as any technical assessment of a new technology.
Ethical issues also have an important role. For example, UK regulators were asked about sheep that were
genetically modified to carry the human gene for factor IX, about normal animals that contained no gene but had been part of an experiment, and about animals that contained an inactive gene or part of a gene. There were no food safety issues involved; but would consumers object to eating an animal that had been part of a scientific experiment, or an animal con- taining an inactive human gene? Was this gene just a stretch of DNA or was it special because it came from a human being? Was it even cannibalism? Would Muslims or Jews be concerned about pork genes in lamb, and vegetarians about animal genes in plants?
Public consultation revealed a variety of concerns, many of an uneasy nature, sometimes called the “yuk” factor. Some individuals were very much opposed to the idea, and none were moved by the fact that there was effectively no chance of eat- ing the original human gene; they remained concerned even if the gene was completely synthetic. The Jewish reaction in contrast was refreshingly straightfor- ward: “If it looks like a sheep, then it is a sheep.” I suggest some of these concerns stem from a deep antipathy to meddling with ‘Nature’. Prince Charles objected to “...taking into the realm of man what
rightly belongs in the realm of God.” For him and some others, genetic modifica- tion is ‘unnatural’, articulating a romantic view of nature that regards everything ‘natural’ as good and anything tampered with by humans as bad.
This argument is based on an interpre- tation of ‘natural’ as not merely a descrip- tion of the world around us, but as a value in itself. In our post-modern Western world, which has largely abandoned con- ventional religions, ‘natural’ has often become synonymous with ‘good’. The question then is why opponents to GM regard it as ‘unnatural’. Possibly, GM came to be seen as an offence to nature by those very people who promote natural- ism. However, under other circum- stances, it could have become part of the organic movement to reduce the use of chemicals in agriculture, and as such would have been seen as ‘natural’. Thus, people with pre-existing agendas projected their value judgements onto the GM debate. In contrast, few scientists see genetic modification as unnatural, but agree that some things are unethical and that not everything that is possible should be done.
The conclusive influences on the GM debate in the UK were those of the media and the non-governmental organizations (NGOs). British newspapers run campaigns in the fierce competition for circulation, readers like scare stories although they may not believe them and scientists do not understand the workings of the media; the stage was set for trouble. In fact, the media had a field day when Árpád Pusztai claimed on television on 10 August 1998, and later in a press con- ference in the UK House of Commons on 12 February 1999, that feeding rats with genetically modified potatoes caused them damage. Despite its eventual publi- cation in a peer-reviewed journal (Ewen &amp; Pusztai, 1999), the Royal Society (1999)

 stated, after a careful investigation by a peer group, that “we found no convincing evidence of adverse effects from GM potatoes.” Although Pusztai’s claim was not supported by evidence (Chen et al, 2003), the headlines of many newspapers from that period stagger the imagination (see sidebar).
This was not the only newspaper cam- paign run against GM foods and crops. Just before the results of the Farm Scale Evaluation were released on 16 October 2003, a large number of anti-GM head- lines appeared in several British newspa- pers, clearly aiming to influence public opinion. Even after the report was pub- lished, many newspapers stated the results as “the end of GM in the UK”. In fact, the trials did not assess the effects of geneti- cally modifying crops but rather the effect of different types of weed control. They had almost nothing to do with genetic modification.
In addition to the hostile attitude of many newspapers, the NGOs involved in the GM debate in the UK have proved themselves to be very skilled at presenting their position to the media. They are highly organized, have clear points of view and are well funded. They know how to ‘spin’, or change the way journalists approach a story. Their mission is not to debate facts and findings but to influence public opin- ion, and any debate with them is unlike a standard scientific debate. NGOs are not looking to find a mutually agreed solu- tion, but rather to promote a single uncom- promising message. As soon as one objec- tion is dealt with, they move on to the next, never admitting that they might be wrong. Scientists, in contrast, know that science at the cutting edge is not always able to provide clear conclusions. But that does not mean “We shall never know”, or even “It is impossible to find out.” In that sense, scientific findings are always provi- sional, but faced with the crisp, clear and often outrageous claims of NGOs, they are unimpressive in the public debate.
So, what lessons have we learned from the GM drama in the UK? First, scien- tists have to organize themselves. In
the debate following Pusztai’s claim, the scientific community was continually los- ing out, while the pressure groups released one news story after another, winning new headlines about every three days. Scientists were always on the defensive,
and often too busy to respond quickly to news stories.
Thus, a rebuttal group is invaluable. For instance, the media reaction to the Farm Scale Evaluations infuriated the sci- entific community in a way I have never seen before. As an interested but indepen- dent scientist I felt we had to respond, so I decided to write to the Prime Minister telling him of widespread demoralization in the scientific community and the dan- ger of losing new technologies, and ask- ing for an assurance that when making his decision about the future of GM, he would take the scientific evidence fully into account. I sent colleagues a draft let- ter, asking whether they would sign it, and within a few days there were 120 signa- tures from men and women working right
across the biological sciences, including a Nobel Laureate, nearly 40 Fellows of the Royal Society and several academics who had helped to start new companies. The letter was delivered to Prime Minister Tony Blair on 30 October 2003, and he replied on 7 November: “I believe that the technology has great potential in the UK [and the Government] will take decisions on the basis of scientific evidence ... and will not react to scare mongering, but will continue to build a firm evidence base.” It is important that a rebuttal group must be able to react quickly to any new develop- ments. They need to stay in constant con- tact and must be prepared to react within 24–48 hours. It is no good waiting until the weekend. Nor is it any good asking a professional society to conduct a “proper review to allay the fears of the public”. It will be too slow, too late and will not influence events.
Scientists must accept the media as it is. What can they do about it? One thing is to get some media training; many scien- tists in the UK have already done this. Another is to get involved, and that means being available at very short notice to respond to requests from radio and TV sta- tions, to have the facts at your fingertips and to be ready to be subjected to hostile, in some cases brutally hostile, question- ing. None of us in the UK have enjoyed this, but many have felt that it is absolutely necessary. Scientists also need a series of ‘good news stories’, not stories about splendid new scientific advances, but realistic, honest stories about how a new technology can benefit the public, and particularly the consumer. I believe that we also have to consider the wider impli- cations of research, recognizing that our work may have ethical implications, and that we should start thinking them through. Most scientists do not have the training, the skills or frankly the right to speak out on these issues. Instead, we need to work with social scientists, philosophers and theologians to adopt a credible stand in the public’s view. It will be an education.
Importantly, we must not adopt the strategies of NGOs, which means that we must not hype. But we also have to get the message across that change is necessary if, to take but one example, we want to feed the burgeoning world population without changes in agriculture. Without such initiatives, scientific research is

 endangered, for it is very easy now to per- suade the public that science for its own sake is risky, even dangerous, and that society does not need it.
None of this is good news. Many a sci- entist will resent the loss of time and the way in which their honest efforts for soci- ety will be twisted, and they may even face personal recrimination. But there is no other way.

GMOS AND ORGANIC AGRICULTURE: SIX LESSONS FROM AUSTRALIA
SUMMARY
GMO moratoria are in place in Australia, in some states and not in others. Is co-existence possible between organic farming and GMO farming? And if so, under what circumstances? Australia has more certified organic land than any other country, with a reported 12.0 million hectares of certified organic land compared to the world total of 37.5 million hectares. In a recent court case, an organic farmer lost his organic certification because of GMO contamination. A total of 325 hectares of his 478 hectare farm were contaminated with GM canola blown from a neighbouring property, and this resulted in the decertification of most of the farm. The organic farmer sued his neighbour, a GMO farmer, on the basis of nuisance or negligence, he sought damages for loss of income, and he sought an injunction to rein in his neighbour‟s future GMO farming practices. The case ran before the Supreme Court of Western Australia over three weeks and it generated more than 1000 pages of transcript. The case was dismissed in its entirety, in a 150 page judgment, and is now subject to an appeal. This paper examines the judgment, in the light of the trial transcript of this landmark case, with the view to determining the implications for the future of organic farming and GMO farming, and in particular to ascertain what lessons can be learned from this litigation.

INTRODUCTION
Australia leads the world in terms of agricultural land certified as organic, and it accounts for nearly a third of the world‟s certified organic agricultural land (Willer &amp; Lernoud, 2014). Organic agriculture is globally important as a method of “sustainable and environmentally friendly production” (Cukur &amp; Celik, 2014) and it has evolved to exclude genetically modified organisms (GMOs) from its production systems (Paull, 2014a).
In Australia, the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) “must assess and license a GM [genetically modified] crop before it can be grown commercially in Australia” (DAFF, 2008). Current commercial-release approvals

are limited to only GM varieties of cotton and canola (OGTR, 2014). The Regulator must be “satisfied that any risks can be managed to protect the health and safety of people and the environment” (DAFF, 2008).
Australian states and territories have some prerogative in allowing or disallowing GMO crops and, with the exceptions of Queensland and Northern Territory, all states and territories have imposed some level of moratorium on the planting of GMO crops (DoA, 2008). Tasmania and South Australia maintain robust moratoria against GMOs, while Victoria, New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australia (WA) allow GM canola.
According to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry: “Growers planting GM canola are required by the technology provider to undertake stewardship training to enable the co-existence of GM and non-GM canola” (DAFF, 2008). Of concerns about the coexistence of GMO agriculture with the organic sector: “ABARE found that GM canola production will have little if any effect on the organic sector” (DAFF, 2008).
In 2003, WA passed the Genetically Modified Crops Free Areas Act 2003 (Calcutt, 2009). In 2008, WA exempted GM cotton in the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) from the moratorium (WADAF, 2010). In January 2010, WA exempted GM canola from the moratorium despite that “since the advent of GM canola in Canada farmers can no longer grow organic canola in Western Canada” (WADAF, 2010) and declared that “common law allows for effective remedies for persons incurring damage from GM crops” (p.3).
Stephen Marsh and Michael Baxter have adjacent farms (Eagle Rest of 478 hectares and Sevenoaks of 700 hectares, respectively) in the Kojonup region of WA, about 256 km south east of the state capital city of Perth. Marsh‟s farm is certified organic by the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture, Australia (NASAA). His neighbour, Baxter, farms chemically and took advice of an agronomist employed by Farmanco, a rural advisory company (Martin, 2014).
Shortly after the moratorium was lifted for GM canola in WA, Farmanco Facts stated that: “The health, safety and environmental risks of adopting GM crops have been dealt with by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator ... Production and economic risks of adopting the GMO lies with the producer” (Pritchard &amp; Trezise, 2010). Adopters of Monsanto‟s GM canola were to “Complete a Technology User Agreement (TUA) including PRAMOG (paddock risk assessment and management option guide)”. The TUA requires “a minimum five metre (5m) separation between GM and non-GM crops”. The transfer of GM material into a neighbour‟s field was anticipated by Farmanco in that initial advisory: “Where your GM crop is on a boundary fence you will need to discuss management options for this scenario and also for the possibility of strong winds moving swaths into your own and your neighbour‟s paddocks” (Pritchard &amp; Trezise, 2010).
In that first year of legalisation in WA, Baxter planted out his paddocks adjacent to Marsh with Monsanto‟s Roundup Ready canola which was genetically engineered to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate (marketed by
 
GMOs and Organic Agriculture: Six Lessons from Australia

Monsanto as Roundup) using genes from bacteria. Marsh had previously alerted Baxter to his concerns that GMO contamination from Baxter‟s GMO crop may put his organic certification in jeopardy (Martin, 2014).
In late November and early December 2010 Marsh discovered GM canola swathes (Paull, 2014b) in some of his paddocks to a distance of 1.2 km into his farm; this was reported to his organic certifier and subsequently most of his farm was decertified (Martin, 2014).
Marsh sued his neighbour claiming common law negligence or private nuisance, he sought damages for loss of income, and an injunction to curtail his neighbour‟s GMO farming practices. The case was heard over the three weeks of 10-28 February 2014 and the judgment was delivered on 28 May 2014. The case was dismissed in its entirety. Organic certification was reinstated over the Marsh farm in October 2013. This case is the most expensive mounted to date by the organics sector, and this paper examines what lessons may be learned from it.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The Marsh v. Baxter case generated a substantial corpus of paperwork including the trial bundle (over 3000 pages), the trial transcript (over 1000 pages), and the judgment (150 pages). There was a general consensus about the facts of the case and the present paper draws particularly on the judgment to reveal what lessons can be drawn from the case. The present account is informed by a site visit to the Kojonup region and the road forming the common boundary of the Marsh and Baxter farms, by personal attendance for some days of the trial, and by informal encounters with the parties and their legal representatives at the Supreme Court of WA.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Contamination
The judge wrote of “the airborne incursion of approximately 245 GM canola swathes, which I have found were blown into some Eagle Rest paddocks from Sevenoaks in late November or early December 2010”. Marsh described this as GMO “contamination” of his farm and so did his organic certifier. The media of various persuasions also characterised this event as “contamination” (e.g. Crothers, 2014; Hamlyn &amp; Trigger, 2014; Jones, 2011; Peckham, 2014) although Forbes proclaimed “„No Such Thing As GMO Contamination‟ Rules Australian Court in Landmark Decision, Rebuffing Organic Activists” (Entine, 2014).
While finding that the Marsh organic farm had been peppered with GM canola from Baxter‟s farm, the judge however did not accept that this amounted to “contamination”. He wrote of “the late November/early December 2010 airborne incursion of GM canola swathes into Eagle Rest (described by the Marshes in their pleadings and submissions in tendentious fashion as a 'contamination')” (Martin, 2014). The judge declared that: “Much of the difficulty ... (... for Mr Marsh) seemed to stem from the fact that the term
 
10 John Paull
'contamination' is not defined in the National Standards or in the NASAA standards” (Martin, 2014).
Marsh v. Baxter failed to get to first base in convincing the judge that there had been a „contamination‟ of the organic farm, and this was likely fatal for a determination of either negligence or nuisance. There being an agreed “incursion” but not an agreed “contamination” the judge suggested that Marsh should take the matter up with his certifier (and outside of the present action) (Martin, 2014).
Lesson 1: Agree the terms underpinning an action, or produce substantiated definitions.
Mitigation
The judge commented unfavorably on the fact that the offending GM canola swathes arrived at Eagle Rest from November 2010 but were not removed until April 2011. There is a general principle in law that an injured party ought to act in a timely manner to mitigate the loss incurred from a harm.
The Judgment states that: “Surprisingly, it appears to have taken Mr Marsh until April 2011 to gather up and remove all the swathes and their (attached) canola seed pods. The gathered swathes then filled two drums ... But between late November 2010 to April 2011, the swathes just appear to have been left in situ, whilst photographed, plotted and even fenced off. Surprisingly, nothing timeous happened about getting rid of them, so as to inhibit any wider dispersal of canola seeds from their shattered seed pods across Eagle Rest's paddocks. In this period the 245 swathes appear to have been rather afforded the status of infamous celebrities ... and then made the subject of media releases ... Asked in cross-examination why it took so long to gather up and remove the canola swathes, Mr Marsh, I thought, gave a very unconvincing response for the inertia. He said that he had been „too busy‟ ... Part of what supposedly occupied his time appears to have been issuing media statements in liaison with NASAA. That is hardly an acceptable explanation. If there was a serious incursion problem of GM material at Eagle Rest to be dealt with, as Mr Marsh evidently felt there was, clearly it ought to have been addressed immediately, as a matter of high priority, rather than the swathes just being left to blow around in the paddocks of Eagle Rest for a period of about five months” (Martin, 2014).
Lesson 2: Mitigate losses as a priority and be seen to do so rather than to publicise them.
Dispute resolution
Invoking the apparatus of the law to resolve a business dispute - a civil matter - is wisely regarded as an action of last resort, for at least three reasons: (a) the cost; (b) the locus of control is shifted to a third party; and (c) the law is an adversarial process which produces win/lose outcomes. The outcome is somewhat
 
GMOs and Organic Agriculture: Six Lessons from Australia
11
unpredictable and is outside of the control of the parties. In contrast, dispute resolution via negotiation or mediation offers the potential of a win/win outcome, and win/win outcomes are the raison d'être and the everyday currency of business. Tradeoffs are made until a transaction materialises where, for example, for the trader the cash is more valued than the goods and for the purchaser the goods are more valued than the cash.
In Marsh v. Baxter the amount raised by the plaintiffs for the action is stated to be AU$750,000 (c.€535,000) (Kinnear, 2014) whereas in contrast “$85,000 [c.€60,000] is the agreed figure for the net loss ... arising by reason of the absence of NASAA certification ... for approximately 70% of the area of the Eagle Rest farm - assuming that liability at this trial is ultimately established against Mr Baxter. That agreed sum has been derived as losses claimed across three successive financial years up to 30 June 2013, by the Marsh farming partnership” (Martin, 2014).
The judge comments on the lack of proportionality between the loss claimed and the potential cost of the recovery: “the $85,000 damages claimed is, in the context of the costs of Supreme Court litigation these days, a demonstrably uneconomic amount of money to be litigating over” (Martin, 2014).
Lesson 3: If the principle is more important than the money then „go for it‟, otherwise consider the proportionality between the known loss versus the unknown cost of the recovery along with the uncertain surety of any recovery.
Injunction
Given the obvious discrepancy between the damages sought and the cost of mounting an action in the Supreme Court the judge observed that “For the present action, a perpetual injunction is the significant remedy that is claimed against Mr Baxter” (Martin, 2014). “Injunctions are orders given by a court requiring a party to refrain from performing an action” (Saligari, 2013).
The injunction sought was a cornerstone of the case, it was the significant remedy claimed, and, that being the case, one might expect that the terms of the sought injunction would be clearly stated. Despite such an expectation, the terms of the sought injunction were in a continuous state of flux right up to “the last breath” of the trial (Martin, 2014).
Originally sought was a permanent injunction against the planting of GM canola within 2 km of the Marsh farm. In the course of the trial this proposed injuncted distance fluctuated until finally being relinquished entirely as was any injuncted planting of GM canola. The various iterations of the „strong‟ anti-GMO injunction eventually evaporated to be substituted with a „weak‟ anti-GMO injunction that only sought to restrain the method of harvesting (swathing) and only in paddocks adjacent to the Marsh farm. It was a muddled retreat, and even a victory (had there been one) would in these final terms have delivered only an eviscerated shadow of the original.
The judgment relates: “The linear dimensions of the area of permanent
 
12 John Paull
restraint as sought ... had shrunk considerably in the period prior to trial ... the plaintiff ... sought permanent restraints against planting GM canola against Mr Baxter on the cascading descent basis of within 2 km, alternatively 1.5 km, alternatively 1.1 km of Eagle Rest. A permanent restraint was also sought against swathing on an unlimited basis but, in the alternative ... it was sought that Mr Baxter be permanently restrained from swathing GM canola ... on the same alternative descending basis ranging between 2 km to 1.1 km” (Martin, 2014). There was no empirical substantiation: “in this trial the plaintiffs led no expert evidence concerning any underlying empirical basis for buffer zone restraints at any distance from Eagle Rest” (Martin, 2014).
The judge comments on the indeterminacy and vacillation of the plaintiffs: “Fluctuations by the plaintiffs over buffer zone distances, as regards inhibiting swathing on Sevenoaks carry ... a revealing insight for ... what was, or was not, reasonable conduct by Mr Baxter in November 2010 as regards his swathing ... More than three years after the 2010 incident, the plaintiffs plainly struggle to identify and to set down any fixed linear buffer distance. They finally reach a point where in the last breath of trial they seek a permanent injunction against swathing of GM canola in the (eastern) boundary paddocks of Sevenoaks.” (Martin, 2014).
The judge delivered his coup de grace: “In circumstances where a court is asked to exercise a discretion to grant permanent injunctive relief, the absence of an empirical basis to support any buffer distance sought (in perpetuity) is a negative consideration of some moment” (Martin, 2014).
Lesson 4: When seeking to limit other‟s actions have well substantiated reasons.
Novelty
Despite the fact that Baxter‟s own agronomic advisory company, Farmanco, had alerted farmers in their Farmanco News to the risk of GM canola swaths blowing onto neighboring properties (Pritchard &amp; Trezise, 2010) the judge saw novelty as an excuse for Baxter.
The judgment states: “Given that growing novelty for GM canola in WA, there was necessarily a certain amount of initial learning associated with the first planting, nurturing and then harvesting such a GM canola crop. Although Mr Baxter had grown canola crops for approximately 10 years before 2010, he had never harvested any of these crops by swathing ... it should be fairly recognised that there was something of an unknown position ... as the first commercial GM canola crops were planted, then harvested by farmers” (Martin, 2014).
Novelty ultimately trumped negligence in the judge‟s determination: “the common law duty of care as contended for by the Marshes ... is conceptually misconceived and cannot be made out. This is for many reasons. Not the least is, in a wholly novel case, the absence of a duty of care to avoid a foreseeable economic loss” (Martin, 2014).
 
GMOs and Organic Agriculture: Six Lessons from Australia Lesson 5: Novelty may support a defence against negligence.
Nuisance
13
 The events precipitating this court case were a nuisance to Marsh in any common usage of the word. However “there is a difference between what is annoying and what is legally classed as a „nuisance‟ ... Private nuisance ... is essentially a dispute between two individuals ... It is enough to show that you have been affected by some act or omission of another person. The effect must be that your enjoyment and use of your land has been interfered with ... you must show that the nuisance complained of is not trivial or unreasonable ... Examples of interference that have been found to be private nuisances include: noisy animals, loud air-conditioners, smoke, overhanging tree branches, tree roots growing into neighbours' land and interfering with drainage, vibrations and dust” (Saligari, 2013).
The judge quoted Pullin that: “Nuisance is a cause of action directed at the harm caused ... proof of nuisance does not involve a failure to exercise reasonable care” (Martin, 2014). The judge observed that a determination of nuisance is about balancing “the right of Mr Baxter to commercially utilise his rural land against the rights of his neighbours, Mr and Mrs Marsh, not to be unreasonably interfered with in their enjoyment and use of Eagle Rest” (Martin, 2014). He found that “there was no unreasonable interference with the Marshes' enjoyment of Eagle Rest” (Martin, 2014). He argued that: “there was no physical damage from the 245 swathes to persons, animals, land or chattels at Eagle Rest. The character of the damage contended for by the Marshes is purely financial, arising out of a private contractual relationship the Marshes voluntarily entered into with ... an organic status certifying organisation” (Martin, 2014). So despite the low hurdles to jump to establish nuisance, in this case they were not low enough.
Lesson 6: Nuisance may be in the eye of the beholder.
CONCLUSIONS
This case has provided no assurance that organic farming and GMO farming can happily coexist under the current legal framework. The organic farmer in the case has regained his organic certification after a three year decertification, but there is no constraint on GM farmers to contain their crops within their boundaries, and no recognition in the case that GM crops are a source of contamination for organic farmers. As for the decertification, the judge suggested that the plaintiff take it up with his certifier and seek relief in that direction, rather than from the farmer of the errant GM canola. There was no recognition of the special interests of organic farmers, and a rejection of the notion that wind-blown GM canola plants landing on an organic farm are in any way „contamination‟, nor that the neighbour‟s actions that led to the „incursion‟ of the GM plants are either a matter of private nuisance or of common law

negligence. The matter is subject to an appeal and so there is a faint hope that some or all of the judgment may be reversed.

            <Text>Why the resistance of Presidents of southern African countries to food aid in 2002?


There was a food crisis in southern Africa 2011-2003, due to drought and bad public policy.

&gt; 15 million people were “dangerously hungry in Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Lesotho. Up to 3 million people faced starvation.

Maize is the staple.

In the summer of 2002, despite their need for food aid, these six nations rejected food aid.
September 2002: WHO convinced Lesotho, Malawi, and Swaziland to accept grain, but Zimbabwe and Mozambique required milling of GM-containing grain before import. This is inconsistent with the concern with the maize as being poisonous as Zambia’s President Mwanawasa characterized it.
The governments refused GM corn because they feared Europe would ban their agricultural exports if they became contaminated with transgenic materials from Bt corn.

Authors’ thesis:
1. NGOs let by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are disseminating information claiming that GM foods are dangerous to human health and are “Frankenfoods.” 
2. People in European Union countries, who are not in any danger of starvation, have strong preferences for non-GM foods, which they can easily afford. </Text>

Abstract
With dengue virus (DENV) becoming endemic in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, there is a pressing global demand for effective strategies to control the mosquitoes that spread this disease. Recent advances in genetic engineering technologies have made it possible to create mosquitoes with reduced vector competence, limiting their ability to acquire and transmit pathogens. Here we describe the development of Aedes aegypti mos- quitoes synthetically engineered to impede vector competence to DENV. These mosquitoes express a gene encoding an engineered single-chain variable fragment derived from a broadly neutralizing DENV human monoclonal antibody and have significantly reduced viral infection, dissemination, and transmission rates for all four major antigenically distinct DENV serotypes. Importantly, this is the first engineered approach that targets all DENV serotypes, which is crucial for effective disease suppression. These results provide a com- pelling route for developing effective genetic-based DENV control strategies, which could be extended to curtail other arboviruses.
           Author summary
With limited success of traditional vector control methods to curb dengue infections and more than half of the world’s population still at risk, there is a need for novel strategies to reduce its impact on public health. Recent advances in genetic technologies has allowed for precise modifications of mosquito genome to make them resistant to infections, thus breaking the transmission cycle. Here we generated engineered Ae. aegypti mosquitoes

Introduction
Dengue fever is a devastating viral disease caused by several antigenically distinct dengue viral (DENV) serotypes that are all dangerous to humans but cannot be readily controlled using broad-spectrum techniques [1,2]. Transmitted by infected mosquitoes, DENV infection typi- cally manifests as severe fever, headaches, and myalgia[3] and can advance to the life-threaten- ing dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome[4]. Global incidences of DENV and its associated economic burden have increased dramatically in recent years [5,6], with over 50% of the world’s population now at risk of infection[7] and 390 million documented infections per year[6] for an estimated $40 billion in economic losses annually[8,9]. Moreover, there are currently no specific treatments nor preventive prophylactic measures [10] because the single commercially available vaccine [11] is only partially effective [12], and due to increased risk of severe dengue illness and hospitalization among certain groups, its use is pre- vented in many contexts [13–15]. Therefore, control of the disease-spreading mosquitoes is currently the best option for preventing DENV transmission [13].
Aedes aegypti [16], the main vector of DENV and other epidemiologically significant viruses such as chikungunya (CHIKV), yellow fever (YFV), and Zika (ZIKV), is a domestic endophilic mosquito[17] that has expanded its habitable range in recent decades[18] and will likely continue to spread[19]. Current control measures including the removal of standing water and the use of chemical insecticides have had limited success in reducing Aedes popula- tions [20] and, thereby, incidences of DENV[21], and can instead cause insecticide resistance and behavioral changes such as a shift in biting times[22,23]. Therefore, novel vector control strategies[24], like the use of genetically modified mosquitoes to either suppress mosquito pop- ulations or render mosquitoes unable to transmit pathogens[25], are increasingly needed. For example, the development and deployment of a genetic Sterile Insect Technique (SIT)-like sys- tem termed Release of Insect Dominant Lethal (RIDL) has had some success in reducing Aedes mosquito populations in the wild[26,27]. Moreover, releases of mosquitoes artificially infected with the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia, which can make infected males inca- pable of successfully mating with uninfected females in an SIT-like manner and can inhibit mosquito infection with pathogens such as DENV and ZIKV[28,29], have also been carried out. These have been intended to either suppress mosquito populations or make them less likely to transmit pathogens, and may hold promise for reducing the incidence of disease [30,31]. However, these technologies require releases of large numbers of insects—and must be carried out on an ongoing basis for RIDL and Wolbachia-based SIT—for continued vector control, which is laborious and expensive.
 efficiently expressing a DENV-targeting single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a previously characterized broadly neutralizing human antibody, which blocked infection and transmission in these mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first exam- ple of an engineered transgene capable of rendering Ae. aegypti mosquitoes 100% refrac- tory to all four serotypes of DENV. The engineered mosquitoes, in future, could easily be paired with a gene drive, capable of spreading the transgene throughout wild disease- transmitting mosquito populations and preventing further DENV transmission. Since a number of diverse and well-characterized antibodies exist against other arboviruses (eg chikungunya and Zika, this work also provides a proof-of-concept principle for develop- ing similar genetic strategies for reducing the impact of these arboviruses.

 Broad dengue neutralization in mosquitoes expressing an engineered antibody
 Therefore, there has been increasing interest in the development of engineered gene-drive technologies, which are able to rapidly transmit themselves and any linked “cargo” genes, such as anti-pathogen effectors, through wild disease-transmitting populations [25,32–35] such that only a few releases of modest amounts of engineered insects could drive desirable cargo genes through wild populations, making them efficient and cost effective for vector control. To achieve disease reduction, such gene-drive systems need to be linked to useful “cargo”, such as effective anti-pathogen genes, and several approaches for engineering Ae. aegypti resistance to DENV have been attempted. For example, one study used RNA interference by employing inverted RNA repeats to target DENV-2 in a conditional and tissue-specific manner[36,37], while another described miRNA cassettes targeting DENV-3 that reduced viral transmission rates[38]. In addition to using synthetic small RNAs, others have taken advantage of the mos- quito’s innate antiviral JAK/STAT pathway to increase resistance to DENV-2 and DENV-4 [39]. However, all previous approaches have been limited by their ability to target only one or two—not all four—major DENV serotypes. Because hyperendemicity of DENV in tropical areas is frequent[5] and secondary DENV infection has been linked to severe dengue disease (SDD), refractory mosquitoes should be capable of blocking all serotypes or risk being ineffec- tive in controlling dengue epidemics. Therefore, better anti-DENV effectors are needed.
Broadly neutralizing antibodies may be especially promising as anti-DENV effector gene candidates because of their ability to neutralize antigenically diverse viruses[40]. However, while engineered monoclonal antibodies that confer resistance to Plasmodium, a protozoan parasite that causes malaria, have been expressed in Anophelene mosquitoes[41–43], none tar- geting a virus have been described in any mosquito species. Previously, a DENV-targeting 1C19 monoclonal antibody (MAb) was identified from a large panel of naturally occurring MAbs from human subjects following vaccination or natural infection[44]. In vitro studies demonstrated that this antibody neutralized viruses from all major DENV serotypes and was capable of significantly reducing viremia in a mouse model after DENV-1 and DENV-2 infec- tion[44]. Here, we engineer Ae. aegypti to express a 1C19-based, broadly neutralizing, single- chain variable fragment (scFv) that is capable of neutralizing all four DENV serotypes[44]. Crucially, we demonstrate that mosquitoes expressing this anti-DENV scFv cannot be infected with or transmit any of the four DENV serotypes and have few significant fitness costs con- ferred by the presence of the antibody. These results provide a promising route for developing effective DENV control strategies using genetically engineered mosquitoes.
Materials and methods
Anti-DENV scFv design
Sequences for the 1C19 variable heavy and light chains were obtained from hybridoma cells expressing the human monoclonal antibody [44] that had been cloned biologically by flow cytometry. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen #74104), and RT-PCR amplifica- tion of antibody gene cDNAs was performed using primer sets designed to detect all human antibody variable gene sequences [44]. The sequence of the antibody cDNAs was determined by automated Sanger sequence analysis. The sequence analysis of the antibody variable gene sequences in the cDNAs was performed using the international ImMunoGeneTics informa- tion system (IMGT).
The variable regions of 1C19 were joined by a 15-amino-acid repeating glycine-serine [G (4)S]3 linker[45] to encode a scFv form of the antibody[46]. These chain regions were codon optimized for Ae. aegypti expression and then gene synthesized into a vector (GenScript, Pis- cataway, NJ). For OA984-HA, a 3’ 30-amino-acid human influenza hemagglutinin (HA)

 epitope tag with a G(4)S linker[47] was added to the carboxy terminus of the single chain anti- body for protein expression verification.
Plasmid assembly
To generate vector OA984 (the anti-DENV scFv-antibody transgene), several components were cloned into the PiggyBac plasmid pBac[3xP3-DsRed] (a kind gift from R. Harrell) using Gibson assembly/enzymatic assembly (EA) cloning [48]. First, a Drosophila codon-optimized tdTomato marker was amplified with primers 984.1A and 984.1B (Supplementary S2 Table for all primers) from a gene synthesized vector (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) and cloned into a XhoI/FseI-digested pBac[3xP3-DsRed] backbone using EA cloning. The resulting plasmid was digested with AscI, and the following components were cloned in via EA cloning: the predicted Ae. aegypti carboxypeptidase promoter [49] amplified from Ae. aegypti genomic DNA using primers 984.2A and 984.2B, a GFP sequence amplified from vector pMos[3xP3-eGFP] [50] with primers 984.3A and 984.3B, and a 677-bp p10 3’ untranslated region (UTR) amplified with primers 984.4A and 984.4B from vector pJFRC81-10XUAS-IVS-Syn21-GFP-p10 (Addgene plasmid #36432). The anti-DENV scFv was then subcloned into the final vector from a gene-synthesized plasmid (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) using PmeI and PacI sites and traditional ligation cloning. Annotated plasmid sequences and plasmid DNA are available via Addgene (plasmid #120363).
To generate vector OA984-HA (anti-DENV scFv with HA-epitope tag), the G(4)S linker and HAx3 tag were amplified with primers 984B.C1 and 984B.C2 from the ninaE[SBP-His] vector containing these components [51] and cloned into the PacI digested OA984 backbone using EA cloning. Annotated plasmid sequences and plasmid DNA are available via Addgene (plasmid #120362). All primer sequences used to generate these plasmids are listed in S2 Table.
Generation of transgenic mosquitoes
Germline transformations were carried out largely as described [52]. Briefly, 0–1 hr old Higgs wildtype (WT) Ae. aegypti pre-blastoderm embryos were injected with a mixture of vector OA984 or OA984-HA (200 ng/μL) and a source of PiggyBac transposase (200 ng/μL)[50]; the injected embryos were hatched in deoxygenated H2O. A total of 127 surviving WT adult G0 males and 115 surviving WT adult G0 females were recovered after the injection. Microin- jected WT G0 adults were assigned to 48 pools and outcrossed to WT of the opposite sex in medium-sized cages. Larvae were fed ground fish food (TetraMin Tropical Flakes, Tetra Werke, Melle, Germany) and adults were fed with 0.3 M aqueous sucrose. Adult females were blood fed three to five days after eclosion using anesthetized mice. All animals were handled in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as recommended by the National Institutes of Health, and the methods were supervised by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A total of 38,177 WT G1s were screened. G1 larvae with strong positive fluorescent signals (3xp3-tdTomato) were selected under the fluorescent stereomicroscope (Leica M165FC) and were separated into six individual groups characterized by fluorescence patterning and intensity. One single transgenic male from each group was then allowed to separately mate with 10 WT females to isolate each independent line. Three independent lines, TADV-A (vector OA984), TADV-B (vector OA984-HA), and TADV-C (vector OA984-HA) with the strongest fluorescence expression patterns were selected for fur- ther characterization. To determine whether these lines represented single chromosomal inser- tions, we backcrossed single individuals from each of the lines for four generations to WT stock and measured the Mendelian transmission ratios in each generation; in all cases, we

 observed a 50% transmission ratio, indicating single-chromosome insertion. For one of the three lines (TADV-A), transgenic mosquitoes were inbred for at least 20 generations to gener- ate a homozygous stock. Mosquito husbandry was performed under standard conditions as previously described [53].
Characterization of insertion sites
To characterize the insertion site of vector OA984 or OA984-HA in transgenic mosquitoes, we adapted a previously described inverse polymerase chain reaction (iPCR) protocol [54] as fol- lows. First, genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from 10 transgenic fourth instar larvae using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen #69504) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Two sepa- rate restriction digests were performed on the gDNA (at 100 ng/μL) to characterize the 5’ and 3’ ends of the PiggyBac insertion using Sau3AI (5’ reaction) or HinP1I (3’ reaction) restriction enzymes. A ligation step using NEB T4 DNA Ligase (NEB #M0202S) was performed on the restriction digest products to circularize digested gDNA fragments, and two subsequent rounds of PCR were carried out per ligation using the corresponding PiggyBac primers listed in S3 Table. The final PCR products were cleaned up using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen #28004) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol and were sequenced via Sanger sequencing (Source BioScience, Nottingham, UK). To confirm the transgene insertion locus and orientation via PCR, primers were designed based on iPCR-mapped genomic regions and used in tandem with PiggyBac primers based on their location as listed in S3 Table. Sequencing data then was blasted to the AaegL5.0 reference genome [55]. The sequenc- ing data was aligned with SeqManPro (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) to determine the orientation of the transgene insertion site. Analysis of the sequencing data indicated that the insertion site for TADV-A is on chromosome 2 (approximate position 310,340,476), the insertion site for TADV-B is on chromosome 2 (approximate position 301,489,980), and the insertion site for TADV-C is on chromosome 1 (approximate position 30,451,048) when aligned to the AaegL5 assembly (GenBank assembly accession: GCA_002204515.1)[56].
Total RNA extraction, isolation, and sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from the midguts of non-blood-fed and 24-hours post-blood-fed TADV-A, TADV-B, TADV-C or WT adult females using the Ambion mirVana mRNA Isola- tion Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific #AM1560). Following extraction, the RNA was treated with Ambion Turbo DNase (ThermoFisher Scientific #AM2238). The RNA quality was assessed using an RNA 6000 Pico Kit for Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies #5067–1513) and a Nano- Drop 1000 UV-vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies/Thermo Scientific, Wilming- ton, DE). mRNA was isolated using an NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB #E7490), and libraries were constructed using an NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB #E7770). The libraries were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific #Q32854) and a High Sensitivity DNA Kit for Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies #5067–4626) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 in single-read mode with a read length of 50 nt and sequencing depth of 30 million reads per library following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reads were mapped to the Ae. aegypti genome (AaegL5.0) supple- mented with the 1C19 cDNA sequence using STAR aligner [57], and the expression levels were determined with featureCounts [58] (S4 Table). Correlation coefficients of the tran- scripts-per-million (TPM) values between WT and transgenic animals were calculated in R [14] and plotted with ggplot2 (S1 Fig). Differential expression analysis between transgenic and WT sample pairs of the same feeding status (NBF or PBM) for each line using DESeq2 [59] identified no significantly changed genes (padj &lt; 0.05) for all six comparisons (data not

 shown). To increase the sensitivity of the assay, two factor analysis using both NBF and PBM samples per line with design = ~ feeding + genotype was also performed and identified a num- ber of differentially expressed genes for each line (S5 Table). However, expression of only nine genes was consistently altered in all three lines (S6 Table), suggesting that expression of the 1C19 scFv transgene had minimal impact on overall expression patterns of endogenous genes. All sequencing data can be accessed at NCBI SRA (study accession ID PRJNA524725).
Western blot assays
The general western blot protocol was adapted from CSH Protocols: SDS-PAGE of Proteins [60]. Briefly, 5–7 days post eclosion, midguts from 25 non-blood-fed and 16-hour post-blood- meal heterozygous TADV-A transgenic and WT mosquitoes were dissected and collected in 1x PBS. Protein samples from dissected tissues were extracted with ice-cold radioimmunopre- cipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% Na-deoxy- cholate, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA). The protein concentration was measured using Protein Assay Dye (Bio-Rad, Cat. No#5000006) and multi-detection microplate readers (Molecular Devices, SpectraMax M2). Next, 40 μg of total protein were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a 0.45 μm Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane (Merck Millipore, Cat. NO#IPVH00010). The membrane was hybridized with a custom antibody at a 1 μg/mL dilu- tion (GenScript, Item number: U3233DA170_2) to directly recognize the 1c19 scFv peptide (26.3KDa) as well as a monoclonal antibody specific to the HA tag for lines TADV-B and C (Cell Signaling, #3724S) at a 1:1,000 dilution; these were subsequently detected by using rabbit IgG antibody (HRP) (GeneTex, Cat. No#GTX 213110–01) at a 1:10,000 dilution. Images were generated by applying the chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore, Cat. No#WBKLS0500) to the blots.
DENV infection of mosquitoes and virus determination
All experiments were performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions in the insectary at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. The following DENV strains were used for all viral challenge experiments: DENV-1 (isolate ET243, GenBank EF440432), DENV-2 (isolate ET300, GenBank EF440433), DENV-3 (isolate ET209, GenBank EF440434), DENV-4 (isolate ET288, GenBank EF440435). The virus was passaged in Vero cell monolayer cultures before use for mosquito infections. WT or transgenic (confirmed by red fluorescence in the eye) mos- quitoes were exposed to DENV as described previously [61]. Briefly, female mosquitoes were challenged with an infected blood meal (TCID50 /mL) through membrane feeding using chicken blood and skin. For infection frequency and virus titer, mosquito midguts were col- lected at 4 dpi. For dissemination and transmission frequency, mosquito saliva, midguts, and carcasses were collected at 14 dpi. Mosquito saliva was used to determine viral titers using a TCID50 assay on Vero cell monolayer cultures. Midguts and carcasses were used to determine the presence of viral RNA using RT-qPCR against NS5. Mosquito viral challenge, processing, saliva testing, and molecular analyses of infection and dissemination were carried out as previ- ously described [61]. DENV infection frequency was defined by the number of midguts (day 4) found positive for viral nucleic acid. Similarly, the dissemination frequency was calculated by the number of carcasses (day 14) found positive by qPCR. Transmission frequency was defined by the number of TCID50-positive saliva samples over the number tested. These differ- ent frequencies and average TCID50 values were compared by the Student’s two-tailed t-test.

 Confirmation of transgene zygosity
Both homozygous and heterozygous (generated by crossing out homozygous individuals to WT) mosquitoes were used for assays. To confirm the zygosity of tested transgenic mosqui- toes, mosquito heads were homogenized using a bead-beater device for DNA extraction in
30 μL of extraction buffer (1x Tris-EDTA, 0.1 M EDTA, 1 M NaCl, and 2.5 μM proteinase K) and incubated at 56 ̊C for 5 minutes and then at 98 ̊C for 5 minutes. The first round of PCR was performed to test for the presence of the anti-DENV transgene using primers 991.3F1 and 1018.S19 (S3 Table). Another round of PCR was then performed using primers 1018.S19 and 1018.S21 (S3 Table) to amplify the WT insertion locus (i.e., locus lacking transgene insertion) and thus determine zygosity. For TADV-B, primer set 991.3R2 and 1018.S73 was used to amplify the anti-DENV transgene and primer set 1018.S73 and 1018.S74 were used to amplify the WT insertion site. For TADV-C, primer sets 991.3F2 and 1018.S80 and set 1018.S80 and 1018.S82 were used to amplify the anti-DENV transgene and WT insertion site, respectively. WT mosquitoes served as controls to ensure that the WT locus was successfully amplified in the genetic background. A PCR kit (ThermoFisher Scientific #F553S) with a 57 ̊C annealing temperature was used for all PCRs following standard protocols.
Generation of wMel Wolbachia line and infection assay
Eggs of Ae. aegypti infected with the Wolbachia strain wMel were obtained from the World Mosquito Program (Prof. Scott O’Neill, Monash University). WT mosquitoes infected with wMel were generated by crossing wMel+ females with males from the WT line, and the result- ing offspring were used for DENV infection experiments. At the end of the experiment, the Wolbachia infection status of these mosquitoes was tested using PCR with primers specific for wMel detection [62] (S3 Table). The PCRs indicated the presence of wMel in &gt;90% of mosqui- toes, and only results from these positive mosquitoes were used for further analysis.
Fitness evaluation on transgenic anti-DENV mosquitoes
To determine if the anti-DENV transgene conferred a fitness cost, several fitness parameters were evaluated in TADV-A transgenic heterozygous and sibling WT mosquitoes. The evalua- tions of all experimental and control replicates were performed simultaneously. Insectary con- ditions were maintained at 28 ̊C and 70 to 80% in relative humidity with a 12 hr light/dark cycle. To assess the larval to pupal development time, the eggs were vacuum hatched, and the larvae were distributed into pans (50 larvae per pan) containing 2.5 L of ddH2O and 0.6 mL of fish food slurry. To determine the larval to pupal development time of transgenic and WT con- trol mosquitoes, the larvae were allowed to pupate, and pupae were collected and counted every day until no pupae were left. To assess female fertility and fecundity, 90 WT and trans- genic females were mated to 20 WT males in a cage. After four days, the females were blood fed and individually transferred into plastic vials filled with water and lined with egg paper. After three days, egg papers were collected, and the eggs were counted and vacuum hatched in nine-ounce plastic cups. Starting on the fourth day, the larvae were counted every day until no larvae were present. Female fecundity refers to the number of eggs laid per female, and fertility reflects the number of eggs hatching to produce larvae. To measure male mating success, fecundity, and fertility, one TADV-A transgenic or WT male was mated to five WT females in a single mesh-covered cup filled with water and lined with egg paper. Three days post blood meal, the cups were checked for the presence of eggs, which were collected, counted, and hatched. Hatched larvae were then counted every day until no larvae were present. Male mat- ing success was calculated as the percentage of single male outcrosses that produced larvae. Fecundity was measured as the number of eggs laid per cup; fertility was determined by the

 number of hatching larvae in each cup. Finally, to assess mosquito longevity, equal numbers of male and female TADV-A transgenic or WT mosquitoes were placed in medium-sized cages (in triplicate). Mosquitoes that died were counted and removed daily until all mosquitoes had died. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA). The means were compared using unpaired t tests with Welch’s cor- rection, with the exception of male mating success that did not use Welch’s correction. The analyses of mosquito survivorship used the Mantel-Cox test. P values &gt; 0.05 were considered not significant.
Results
Generation of DENV-resistant mosquitoes
To determine whether expressing an anti-DENV antibody in mosquitoes could confer resis- tance to DENV, we first needed to engineer a broadly neutralizing antibody that was compati- ble with mosquitoes and could be expressed in vivo in its desired form. We chose 1C19 as our model due to its ability to cross-neutralize multiple DENV serotypes in humans[44]. As it is a human monoclonal antibody, however, it cannot be unobtrusively expressed in mosquitoes, so a new form that is both compatible with mosquitoes and maintains its neutralization capabili- ties had to be designed. We then choose to engineer an scFv comprising the linked variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains because this format removes the human-specific constant region that could impart difficulties in a mosquito and it can be expressed in one “chunk” in an organism without the need for additional in vivo processing. To do this, sequences for the 1C19 VH and VL chains were obtained from hybridoma cells expressing the human monoclo- nal antibody[44]. We then engineered a scFv comprising the VH and VL domains of 1C19 linked using a 15-amino-acid repeating glycine-serine [G(4)S]3 linker[45] that was codon- optimized for Ae. aegypti. We also engineered a version of this 1C19 scFv that was fused with a 3’ 30-amino-acid human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, commonly used as a gen- eral expression tag, reasoning that it might be useful in downstream expression analyses. To conditionally drive expression of the 1C19 scFvs in the midgut of female mosquitoes following a blood meal, which would ensure 1C19 expression any time the mosquito was in contact with DENV, we used the Ae. aegypti carboxypeptidase (CP) promoter [49], which should induce expression in the midgut following blood ingestion (Fig 1A). (Previous findings determined that the CP promoter induces enhanced transcription of Aedes aegypti CPA mRNA after a blood meal and a somewhat moderate expression in sugar-fed mosquitoes [63].)The engi- neered anti-DENV transgenes (termed plasmid OA984 for the untagged version and plasmid OA984-HA for the HA-tagged version) also contained an eye-specific 3xP3 promoter[64], driving expression of tdTomato as a fluorescent transgenesis marker. Following the typical transgenesis procedure in mosquitoes, consisting of embryonic microinjection and G0 out- crossing, multiple independent transgenic lines (n = 6) were readily identified in the G1 gener- ation via the robust expression of tdTomato fluorescence; three of the lines with the strongest marker expression (termed Transgenic Anti-DENV [TADV]-A, containing OA984; and TADV-B and C, containing OA984-HA) were selected for further experiments. We carried out inverse PCR (iPCR) on genomic DNA extracted from the transgenic mosquitoes to verify the transgene insertion site and performed backcrosses to WT for multiple generations to ensure that the transgenic lines represented single chromosomal insertions, and were able to confirm that, in all three independent lines, the anti-DENV transgenes were stably integrated into single chromosomes.

TADV-A mosquitoes were generated via transgenesis with the anti-DENV construct, and TADV-A, wMel, and WT mosquitoes were then challenged with a blood meal infected with one of four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, isolate ET243; DENV-2, isolate ET300; DENV-3, isolate ET209; or DENV-4, isolate ET288). After the infected blood meal enters the mosquito midgut, there are two potential outcomes: in the first (applies for all tested strains), the virus replicates and disseminates past the midgut to become transmissible; in the second (applies to TADV-A mosquitoes), the anti-DENV transgene expresses scFv antibodies in the midgut that bind to the virus and neutralize it. (B) Plots depicting viral titers. To determine if the anti-DENV transgene confers resistance to all four DENV serotypes, we determined viral titers in extracted midguts, carcasses, and saliva from WT, TADV-A (homozygous [Hm] and heterozygous [Ht]), and wMel infected mosquitoes. Viral genome equivalents (GE) from mosquito midguts (at 4 days post infection [dpi]) and carcass (at 14 dpi) were determined using RT-qPCR and calculated using previously published methods.

 Expression of 1C19 scFv antibody
Robust expression and processing of 1C19 scFv transcripts is required for proper neutraliza- tion of DENV, and it is important to know if such expression perturbs global gene-expression patterns, which might interfere with the fitness of the mosquito. To confirm this, we sequenced total RNA populations from dissected midgut tissues isolated from both blood-fed and non- blood-fed female Higgs wildtype (WT) or TADV-A, B, or C mosquitoes using an Illumina platform. We detected robust expression of the 1C19 scFv mRNA in both non-blood-fed and 24-hour post-blood-fed transgenic mosquitoes of all three lines, with clearly increased expres- sion levels at 24-hours post-blood meal, while no expression was observed in the midguts of female WT mosquitoes, suggesting that expression of the 1C19 scFv antibody is transgene- dependent and blood-meal-inducible (~2.35–14.45 fold) as was intended. Importantly, while there were some changes in expression of some genes in transgenic mosquitoes when com- pared to WT, these represented a small fraction of the genome and, with a few exceptions, did not appear to be consistent between the three transgenic lines (S5 and S6 Tables). This suggests that the 1C19 scFv expression does not affect gene-expression patterns in a major, global way (S1 Fig, S4–S6 Tables).
To confirm the proper expression of the 1C19 scFv, we performed western blots on dis- sected midgut tissue from non-blood-fed and blood-fed WT and TADV-A as well as blood- fed TADV-B and TADV-C female mosquitoes using either a custom anti-1C19 scFv antibody, or an anti-HA antibody. Blot analyses revealed that the 1C19 scFv peptide was efficiently expressed following a blood meal exclusively in transgenic mosquitoes (S2 Fig). Altogether, these results suggest that the anti-DENV transgene is stably integrated into the mosquito genome and that the DENV-targeting 1C19 antibody is expressed in an appropriate context (i.e., in the midgut following a blood meal) for DENV suppression.
Engineered mosquitoes are resistant to infection with all four DENV serotypes
To determine the functional significance of anti-DENV 1C19 scFv expression on vector com- petence, the DENV-2 infection rates of the three transgenic TADV lines were first compared to that of WT. To do this, adult females (WT or TADV-A, B, or C) were exposed to serotype DENV-2 (isolate ET300, Genbank EF440433) via membrane blood feeding. At 4 days post infection (dpi), midguts from blood-fed mosquitoes were dissected, and DENV RNA copies were measured using RT-qPCR. All three lines showed a significant reduction in midgut infec- tion rate (45 to 71%) and viral RNA levels (2 to 3 log lower) compared with WT control mos- quitoes (infection rate 92%) (S3 Fig; S1 Table). Since no significant difference in DENV-2 midgut infection levels was detected between the three transgenic lines, TADV-A, which exhibited the strongest antiviral phenotype (S3 Fig; S1 Table), was selected for further compre- hensive characterization.
For a more detailed study of the TADV-A DENV vector competence, the effect of transgene zygosity on the infection rate was determined by exposing additional adult females (WT or TADV-A) to serotype DENV-2 and analyzing the dissected midguts at 4 dpi. Results from three biological replicates revealed that none of the TADV-A mosquitoes homozygous for the transgene (n = 35) were positive for DENV-2 infection in the midguts (Fig 1B). DENV-2 infec- tion was detected in 85.4% (35/41) of the TADV-A mosquitoes that were heterozygous for the transgene; however, these mosquitoes had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) lower (~3 log10) viral RNA levels (8.20 x 101 genome equivalent [GE]) than the WT (4.25 x 104 GE) (Fig 1B, Table 1).
To assay for viral dissemination to the rest of the mosquito body, total RNA was collected from whole TADV-A mosquito carcasses (without midguts) and dissected midguts from both

homozygous and heterozygous mosquitoes at 14 dpi. The results from three biological repli- cates indicated that none of the homozygous TADV-A mosquitoes (n = 30) were positive for viral replication (dissemination) in either the midgut or the midgut-free carcass (Fig 1B,
Table 1). DENV-2 prevalence was detected in 86.6% (26/30) of heterozygous TADV-A mos- quitoes in both the carcass and midgut; however, they also had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) lower levels of viral RNA (~3 log10) compared to the WT (Fig 1B, Table 1). Finally, as transmission occurs through the saliva, viral transmission rates were determined by collecting the saliva from individual mosquitoes at 14 dpi and measuring the DENV-2 titers using an assay for the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). No DENV-2 was detected in the saliva of homo- zygous TADV-A mosquitoes (n = 30) (Fig 1B), though it was detected in 83.3% (25/30) of het- erozygous TADV-A mosquitoes; however, here again the DENV-2 titers were significantly
(p &lt; 0.001) lower (3.56 x 102 TCID50/ml/mosquito) than the WT mosquitoes (2.70 x 105 TCID50/ml/mosquito) (Fig 1B, Table 1).
To determine whether the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv is broadly inhibitory for other DENV serotypes, the vector competence of TADV-A mosquitoes was assessed using DENV-1 (isolate ET243, GenBank EF440432), DENV-3 (isolate ET209, Genbank EF440434), and DENV-4 (iso- late ET288, Genbank EF440435). Tests for infection, dissemination, and transmission were

 carried out as above, and the results, presented together in Fig 1B and Table 1, were compara- ble to those obtained with the DENV-2 serotype. In short, the TADV-A mosquitoes homozy- gous for the transgene proved to be refractory to infection with all three additional serotypes also showing no infection in their midguts at 4 dpi (DENV-1 n = 28; DENV-3 n = 30; DENV- 4 n = 27). Even at 14 dpi, there was no sign of viral replication in the midgut or carcass for all tested specimens, and none of the saliva samples (DENV-1 n = 28; DENV-3 n = 30; DENV-4 n = 28) were positive for the virus. As with DENV-2, the mosquitoes heterozygous for the transgene still tested positive for the virus in most specimens, though the overall DENV titers were significantly lower than compared to the WT in all cases (Fig 1B; Table 1).
Engineered anti-DENV mosquitoes outperform Wolbachia
To compare the inhibitory effect of the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv to DENV inhibition through Wolbachia[65–67] infection, we challenged WT mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia (wMel) with DENV-2. Vector competence results revealed that midguts from mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced DENV-2 RNA levels (4.75 x 101 GE) at 4 dpi compared with the WT (4.25 x 104 GE) (Fig 1B, Table 1). Similarly, viral dissemination at 14 dpi was also reduced (p &lt; 0.001) in wMel mosquitoes (~3 log10), and DENV titers in mos- quito saliva at 14 dpi were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) lower (~3 log10) in wMel mosquitoes (4.90 x 101 TCID50/ml/mosquito) than in the WT (2.70 x 105 TCID50/ml/mosquito) (Fig 1B, Table 1). Importantly, a direct comparison revealed that the TADV-A mosquitoes are significantly
(p &lt; 0.001) more effective as homozygotes, and similarly effective as heterozygotes, at blocking DENV infection as Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.
Transgene impact on fitness
To determine whether the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv had any significant fitness effects on trans- genic mosquitoes, we assessed several fitness parameters including larval to pupal development time, male and female fecundity and fertility, male mating success, and longevity (Table 2). No significant differences were observed between WT and TADV-A mosquitoes when examining male mating success and fecundity and fertility in both males and females (p &gt; 0.05). However, we noticed a significant difference in larval to pupal development times (p &lt; 0.0001), with WT mosquitoes developing, on average, 0.8 days faster than TADV-A mosquitoes. When assessing mosquito survivorship, there was no significant difference between WT and TADV-A males (p &gt; 0.05; S4 Fig), though WT female mosquitoes lived, on average, 4.5 days longer than TADV-A females (p &lt; 0.05; S4 Fig). The longevity of infected mosquitoes was also assessed. Transgenic, WT, or wMel mosquitoes were infected with four DENV serotypes and their sur- vivorship was assessed 14 dpi (Table 2). No significant (p &gt; 0.01) differences between WT and TADV-A longevity upon infection with serotypes DENV-2, -3, and -4 were observed. How- ever, there was a significant difference in survival upon infection with serotype DENV-1, with a higher proportion of WT mosquitoes surviving at 14 dpi (p &lt; 0.01; Table 2, S4 Fig). In addi- tion, a significant difference in survival between wMel mosquitoes and WT and TADV-A mosquitoes infected with serotype DENV-2 was observed (p &lt; 0.0001; S4 Fig).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that conditional expression of the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv renders mosquitoes refractory to all four major DENV serotypes and therefore appears to be a potent viral inhibition strategy. While mosquitoes homozygous for the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv showed complete refractoriness to DENV infection, heterozygous mosquitoes were still partially refractory to DENV infection, dissemination, and transmission, with significant, several

Comparisons of several fitness parameters (left-most column) between WT (second column from left) and TADV-A mos- quitoes (third column from left) suggest that there are few significant differences (right-most column) between the two groups, indicating that the anti-DENV scFv does not have a major impact on mosquito fitness. The survivorship of infected and non-infected mosquitoes is also shown. The median survival in days was determined for non-infected mosquitoes, and the percent of surviving mosquitoes separately infected by four DENV serotypes was assessed at 14 dpi.

 orders-of-magnitude reductions in viral titers in the saliva. Given previous characterizations of the 1C19 scFv antibody, we presume that it achieves this refractoriness because, when it is secreted into the epithelium of the posterior midgut in mosquitoes [63], it binds to the exposed fusion loop of DENV and inhibits the virus particle from releasing its genome into the cyto- plasm for replication. Based on previous findings, it is likely that this significant reduction in viral titers would be sufficient to render heterozygous mosquitoes unable to transmit DENV to a susceptible host[68]. Though this remains to be demonstrated, our results show that hetero- zygous 1C19 scFv antibody-expressing transgenic mosquitoes are just as efficient at viral sup- pression as—and homozygous mosquitoes are significantly more efficient than—Wolbachia- infected mosquitoes, which are currently being released for DENV control because they are known to be refractory to DENV[65].
The difference in refractory levels in the homozygous versus heterozygous mosquitoes also suggests that the refractory phenotype is particularly sensitive to scFv antibody expression lev- els, a phenomenon previously observed with anti-malarial scFv transgenes [41] and anti-ZIKV synthetic small RNA transgenes [69]. If this means that complete refractoriness is susceptible to positional effects, e.g., not refractory when the scFv antibody transgene is expressed from a different, possibly more weakly expressing genomic insertion position, the identification of more robust midgut-specific promoters may help to ensure sufficiently high expression levels from a single copy of the transgene regardless of insertion site, as can the use of multiple anti-

 DENV scFv antibodies in a single transgene [41,43]. Additionally, while we observed no signif- icant reduction in multiple fitness parameters in transgenic mosquitoes when compared to WT, some differences in fitness were observed, and more extensive analyses on fitness of both infected and uninfected transgenic heterozygotes and homozygotes (possibly after introgres- sion with a field-collected mosquito strain) would have to be performed before use of such mosquitoes in the field.
The strategy we describe here provides an efficient “cargo” gene that can be coupled with a gene-drive system to reduce or eliminate the risk of DENV transmission by mosquitoes. In fact, previous efforts have demonstrated effective Cas9-mediated homing-based gene drives in malaria vectors [70–72], and even Ae. aegypti [34]. Additionally, since homing-based drive sys- tems quickly convert heterozygotes to homozygotes [25], linking the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv antibody described here to such a drive system could, in theory, rapidly convert wild mosquito populations into transgenic homozygotes that would be completely resistant to DENV trans- mission. Of paramount importance to the viability of such an approach is the evolutionary sta- bility of the refractory transgene, specifically in terms of the likelihood of viral-resistant evolution. Indeed, several studies have shown that, in some contexts, DENV can rapidly evolve resistance in response to neutralizing antibodies [73,74], and this may be especially likely in the TADV-A heterozygotes described in this study. However, this potentially can be managed through the selection of antibodies with mechanisms/epitopes that minimize the chance of evolved resistance and the use of a combination of distinct anti-DENV antibodies (many of which have been described, e.g.,[44,73–76]), as well as a combination of antibody and non- antibody based DENV refractoriness transgenes (e.g., [36,37]; [38]; [39])). The deployment of such a pan-serotype-targeting strategy could serve as an effective component of a comprehen- sive program to reduce the incidence and impact of DENV.
Due to similarities within viral families, this research could have far-reaching consequences for rendering mosquitoes resistant to other arboviruses like ZIKV and CHIKV by using similar genetic engineering strategies to develop scFv-based transgenes. Multiple potent antibodies that effectively neutralize these various mosquito-borne viruses have also been identified in the last decade[77–81]. Although not all of these will confer robust viral resistance when expressed in vivo in mosquitoes, the availability of diverse, well-characterized antibodies of this sort, largely as a result of antibody therapeutic development efforts[78], should allow for the identi- fication of those that function within the desired context. Given the increasing incidence of disease caused by these viruses and the resulting global health implications, such scFv-based transgenes coupled with gene-drive systems[34] can provide an effective, sustainable, and comprehensive strategy for reducing the impact of arboviral mosquito-borne diseases.

The y- axis corresponds to TPM values in WT samples, and the x-axis corresponds to TPM values in respective transgenic samples. Blue-colored points represent endogenous genes, and red-col- ored points represent the 1C19 scFv. Comparisons between WT and TADV samples suggest that 1C19 scFv expression is transgene-dependent and does not appear to significantly affect global expression levels of endogenous RNAs. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between gene expression levels in WT versus transgenic samples are reported in bold in their respective graphs.

 S2 Fig. Western blot analyses to probe for the presence of the 1C19 scFv antibody protein in WT and transgenic midgut samples. Western blots were carried out utilizing a custom antibody specific for the 1C19 scFv protein, as well as an antibody to recognize the 3xHA tag, on dissected midgut tissues from non-blood-fed or 16-hour post-blood-meal WT or TADV-A, TADV-B, or TADV-C mosquitoes. An anti-GAPDH antibody was used as a control. The pres- ence of a 26.3-kDa band confirms the expression of the 1C19 scFv protein in transgenic, but not in WT, mosquito midgut samples. The presence of a 30 kDa band indicates the presence of the 3xHA tag in TADV-B and TADV-C but not in WT or TADV-A mosquitoes.

Sig- nificant differences in survivorship were observed between WT and TADV-A females, with WT females surviving, on average, 4.5 days longer (p � 0.01).

The survivorship of infected mos- quitoes was determined over the course of 14 days (the time it takes for the virus to dissemi- nate past the midgut and eventually become transmissible). No significant differences in survivorship were found between WT and TADV-A mosquitoes when infected with DENV-3 and DENV-4, but significant differences were observed upon infection with DENV-1, with more WT mosquitoes (80%) surviving at 14 dpi than TADV-A mosquitoes (~40%; p � 0.01). When infected with DENV-2, more wMel mosquitoes (&gt;90%) survived at 14 dpi compared to WT and TADV-A mosquitoes (both ~70%; p &lt; 0.0001).

Foreword by Sir David King, Government Chief Scientific Adviser
The GM Science Review was commissioned as part of the wider GM public dialogue by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; with the agreement of the responsible Ministers in the devolved administrations. This report which supplements our earlier publication in July last year has, like the First Report, now been formally submitted to Mrs Margaret Beckett MP, Mr Allan Wilson MSP at the Scottish Executive, Mr Carwyn Jones AM at the National Assembly for Wales, and Mrs Angela Smith, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office, to help inform government’s decision making on GM crops and food.
The Review has continued in its endeavour of taking an open look at the science relevant to GM crops and food, and to do so in a way that recognises the interests and concerns of the public as well as the science community.
The Science Review Panel’s First Report was published in July 2003 and attracted wide public and media interest, both in the UK and abroad, with over 20,000 copies downloaded from the Review website. The Panel invited comments on the report and we entered the second phase of our Review. During this second phase, the Panel met on four occasions to discuss comments received on our First Report and the extent to which these altered our conclusions. We also examined the report of the GM Public Debate ‘GM Nation?’, to consider whether there were any further issues we should address and we also looked to see if there had been significant developments in GM science over the summer that we should report on. In particular, we considered the results of the UK Farm-Scale Evaluations of GM crops.
Once more, I extend my thanks to the Panel members for the time they have given and the cooperative way in which they have worked on this Second Report. As with the First Report, we have respected differences in views and recognised that that Panel members do not individually cover all the areas of expertise. On this basis, I am pleased to say that as with the First Report, the Panel has taken collective ownership of the Second Report.
On behalf of the Panel, I would also like to thank all those who submitted comments. We have sought to take account of your submissions. And I know that the Panel would wish to acknowledge the dedication of the Secretariat, in bringing this Second Report to print.
Finally, the publication of this Second Report marks the end of the GM Science Review and its Panel. Science moves on and the scientific debate over GM issues will continue. Scientific GM advisory committees such as the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE), the Advisory Committee on Novel Food and Processes (ACNFP) and the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs (ACAF) will continue in their task of advising the UK government on the safety of GM food and feed and impacts on the environment and we hope this Review facilitates their work. We also hope that we have succeeded at least in part, in our ambition of engaging in scientific issues of public interest to raise the level of discussion about GM matters in the UK. In conclusion, I note that the GM Science review process, taken in the context of the UK Government’s wider GM Dialogue, has been generally regarded as a very positive and useful exercise. I believe this initiative provides important lessons and a positive model for any such exercise in future.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The GM Science Review Panel’s First Report was published on 21 July 2003 and attracted wide public and media interest, with over 20,000 copies downloaded from the Review website. The second phase of the GM Science Review had three main purposes:
• to consider the issues raised in the Public Debate held in the summer of 2003 in the context of our First Report;
• to address new scientific developments that had taken place since the publication of our First Report, including the publication of the GM Herbicide-Tolerant Crop Farm- Scale Evaluations (FSEs) on 16 October 2003; and
• to consider reactions to the First Report received by letter and through the Review website and to consider to what extent these altered our conclusions.
Section 1: The significance of the Public Debate for the Science Review
We reviewed the Public Debate Report: ‘GM Nation?’, and consider that our First Report covered those scientific issues raised by the public that were relevant to our remit. See Section 1.2 for an analysis of points raised and for relevant references to the First Report. The GM Science Review Panel and the Public Debate Steering Board were assisted by the foundation discussion workshops1. These helped to frame the issues both for the Public Debate and for our Review. We noted that some of the concerns expressed in the course of the Public Debate coincided with scientific uncertainties already identified and discussed in our First Report. Far from being ‘anti-science’, there was a strong theme in the Public Debate for further research to be done.
Section 2: New published research
Any review can only be based on the state of knowledge and understanding at the time it is carried out, and new research results have continued to emerge since the First Report was published. In addition to our consideration of the FSEs in Section 3, we reviewed a number of other important recent scientific papers, concentrating on their possible impact on our conclusions. None of this newly published research significantly altered our earlier conclusions.
Section 3: The GM Crop Farm-Scale Evaluations
The FSE results were published after our First Report, and we considered them in detail in the second phase of our work. Our conclusions were submitted to the Advisory Committee on
1 Organised by Corr Willbourn Research and Development. 5
 
Releases to the Environment (ACRE) for consideration before ACRE put its advice to Government. We judged the FSEs to be work of high scientific calibre. In essence, the experiments compared the impacts on aspects of biodiversity of herbicide regimes used on three GM herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops (maize, sugar beet and spring oilseed rape) with those used on conventional equivalent crops.
Our conclusions from the FSEs are as follows.
• If all else remains constant and the three crops are introduced and managed in the way they were in the trials, then for GMHT beet and spring oilseed rape a significant reduction would be expected in weed biomass and weed seed return resulting in fewer nectar resources for pollinators and fewer weed seed resources for granivorous birds. For GMHT maize the opposite is expected.
• These effects arise from the crop management regimes (i.e. the herbicide applications) associated with these GMHT crops, and are not a direct consequence of the way the crops have been produced.
• These data, and more that will follow, offer modelling opportunities to assess the longer-term and large-scale implications of this work, and will inform debate on broader agricultural issues related to societal choices and the balance of natural resources.
• That the findings of the experiments were different for different crops with GMHT traits reinforces the general conclusion in our First Report that impacts of GM crops must always be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
Section 4: Feedback on the First Report
We reviewed the substantial range of comments and questions received by letter and on the website concerning the First Report, and considered to what extent these altered our conclusions. We were gratified to receive a broad range of responses, and pleased that respondents had the opportunity to raise new interpretations of the evidence or literature. We have responded when the feedback we received provided new information and/or extended the range of views previously discussed in the First Report. As part of the aspiration of the GM Science Review to provide a reference point/information source for the ongoing scientific and public consideration of this issue, the Second Report also provided an opportunity to clarify some of the points in the First Report.
Conclusion
Our First Report stated that we had found no scientific case for ruling out all GM crops and their products, but nor did it give them blanket approval. We emphasised that genetic modification is not a single homogeneous technology and that its applications need to be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Whilst our Second Report does not alter this general conclusion, we have been prompted to clarify a number of points and explore some issues in more detail. For that we are grateful to
6

all those who provided us with feedback. This feedback and newly published research has helped us refine a number of arguments and has taken the process forward in terms of the science. In as much as we have systematically examined the issue of GM crops in the UK and have looked for areas of uncertainty and risk that may be addressed by research, we hope the Science Review will inform present policy debates and future research agendas.

Section 1
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PUBLIC DEBATE FOR THE SCIENCE REVIEW
1.1 THE THREE STRANDS OF THE ‘GM DIALOGUE’
The decision to have a ‘GM Dialogue’ was announced by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mrs Margaret Beckett MP, in July 2002. The three strands of the dialogue were: a Public Debate, as recommended by the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission (AEBC); a study of the possible costs and benefits of GM, undertaken by the Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit; and a review of GM Science undertaken by an independent science review panel, chaired by the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir David King.
There was interaction between the three strands at an official level, so that each understood the intentions and progress of the other, but there was limited interaction at a public level. Neither the Strategy Unit nor the Science Review Panel reported in time to inform the Public Debate, ‘GM Nation?’. However, the Science Review drew explicitly on preparatory work for the Public Debate (as described below) and our First Report was published in July 2003 to allow comments from organisations and individuals to be considered in a second phase (see Annex 1), and to be able to take on board the results of ‘GM Nation?’.
1.2 THE KEY MESSAGES FROM THE PUBLIC DEBATE
The report from the Public Debate Steering Board ‘GM Nation?’ identified seven key messages:
(1) People are generally uneasy about GM.
(2) The more people engage in GM issues, the harder their attitudes and more intense their concerns.
(3) There is little support for early commercialisation.
(4) There is widespread mistrust of Government and multi-national companies.
(5) There is a broad desire to know more and for further research to be done.
(6) Developing countries have special interests.
(7) The debate was welcomed and valued.
Of these, points 4 &amp; 5 are most relevant to the Science Review process, and are discussed further below. Point 2 may also be relevant. Public concerns about scientific uncertainty were central to the task of the Science Review Panel.
9

The Science Review was framed to reflect public concerns by using the same foundation discussion workshop results (the Corr Willbourn Report) as used by ‘GM Nation?’ as well as issues raised on the Science Review website and discussions at open meetings. This appears to have been broadly successful. The main scientific issues raised in the ‘GM Nation?’ Report are treated in depth in the Science Review and are as follows:
• ‘Risk of contamination’, and ‘freedom of choice’, are both addressed in Chapter 7.2, looking at gene flow between crop varieties and co-existence1.
• ‘Exercising precaution’, which is addressed in Chapter 3.2 as a regulatory issue.
• ‘Lack of reliable, independent scientific evidence’ – the Science Review was designed to address this question by reviewing available evidence and identifying gaps in knowledge and understanding, uncertainties and possible areas for further research.
• ‘Questioning the need for GM crops’ – the Science Review included information on potential benefits in Chapter 6.6 (horizon-scanning) and in other Chapters. The Strategy Unit Report covered this subject in more detail.
• ‘Environment at risk’ was addressed in Chapters 6 and 7 of the Science Review.
• ‘Health at risk’ was addressed in Chapter 5 of the Science Review.
• ‘Power of the multi-nationals’, ‘non-material values’, ‘doing right by developing countries’ and ‘labelling and liability’ are issues beyond the scope of the Science Review, except where labelling issues bear on co-existence, as discussed in Chapter 7.2.
• ‘Experience overseas’ – some of the emerging evidence of experience in other countries has been included in the Science Review, as has discussion about the extent to which use of GM in other countries constitutes evidence of safety.
• ‘Most resistance to trans-species applications and GM food’. The extent to which GM is ‘different’ and raises new issues, as well as the appropriateness of a ‘case-by-case’ approach to address any potential risks and benefits of GM products, are discussed in Chapter 4. The safety of GM food is discussed in Chapter 5.
1.2.1 Public Debate message 4: ‘There is widespread mistrust of Government and multi-national companies’
The ‘GM Nation?’ report claimed that this mistrust extended to scientists. People were concerned ‘that Government may not have adequate knowledge and advice to help them take the right decisions’.
1 The AEBC has recently published a Report on co-existence: ‘GM Crops? Co-existence and Liability’. November 2003.
 10

An important outcome of the Science Review is that many of the uncertainties and gaps in knowledge it addressed, for example in long-term impacts on health or the environment and the co-existence of GM crops with other crops, coincide with concerns expressed during the Public Debate. What the Science Review has done is make clear the extent of the uncertainties and their importance, and places them in the context of uncertainties associated with conventional crops and food. This confirms the importance of the Science Review’s explicit treatment of uncertainty in its process and indicates that continued open public discussion of the nature and significance of uncertainties is crucial in re-establishing trust in science and its use in Government.
An important message from the Strategy Unit Report was that ‘the overall balance of costs and benefits (of GM commercialisation in the UK) will depend on public attitudes, market demands, and on the ability of the regulatory system to manage uncertainties’.
1.2.2 Public Debate message 5: ‘There is a broad desire to know more and for further research to be done’
Although often characterised as being ‘anti-science’, one theme throughout the Public Debate was for more research to be done. Our First Report highlighted areas where further research could contribute to greater understanding (on allergenicity, invasiveness, impact on farmland ecology, impact of geneflow to other crops or wild relatives, effects on soil ecology). The GM Crop Farm-Scale Evaluations (FSEs) are an example of current research to assess potential impacts of different weed management regimes on wildlife during cultivation of particular herbicide tolerant GM crops. The FSEs represent pioneering experiments which raise important broad issues about the way that the impact of agriculture on the environment is evaluated, and how a particular type of GM crop may influence this.
Research funding bodies in the UK and EU are continually identifying and sponsoring relevant scientific research on a broad front. This includes research relevant to assessing the environmental impact of crops and the safety of their products. We hope that the Science Review will influence their agendas.
‘GM Nation?’ also identified a desire for a body of factual scientific information about the production, cultivation, risks and benefits of GM crops. One of the primary aims of the Science Review was to discuss the status of our scientific knowledge, and agree, where possible, on the level of understanding. Where there was disagreement, this was outlined in our Report, together with ways this might be resolved. Our First and Second reports form a contemporary body of knowledge on GM crops and food. Further investigation and research will add to this, but one of the strengths of the Science Review process was that it also illustrated the potential to resolve divergent interpretations of scientific evidence, and divergent views on the adequacy of evidence, among its broad membership of scientists and non-scientists. Open acknowledgement of a divergence of views, as well as uncertainty, are important components of public trust in science as used by policy-makers.
11

1.2.3 Public Debate message 6: ‘Developing countries have special interests’
The role of GM crops in developing countries was raised repeatedly during the public consultation carried out in preparation for our First Report. This was one topic of discussion in the debate, but as it was beyond our remit, we could not treat it in detail. The outcome of the Public Debate suggests that the role of GM in developing countries is a subject of special interest, which may be judged on risks/benefit criteria and ethical issues that are different from those for GM crops in the UK. We hope that the scientific information gathered in the Science Review and subsequent assessment of the evidence will prove helpful to other countries in their own scientific deliberations and assessments (See also Section 4.3.1.).
1.3 IN CONCLUSION
In drawing conclusions concerning the significance of the Public Debate for the Science Review, we would like to return to some issues discussed in our First Report. We highlight there (page 8), that some of the questions over GM crops are not of a purely scientific nature, or even scientific at all but may be economic, social, ethical or even personal. Of those that are scientific, as in any field, the answers given by science will typically depend on the particular questions that are asked, the way they are framed and the assumptions that are made in analysis. Of course, scientific discipline and rigorously gathered data can narrow down the range of possible answers, and make an important contribution to various issues, but the science will often support more than one interpretation and may raise new uncertainties or reveal new gaps in knowledge. It is for these reasons that the provision of robust scientific advice to policy making, depends not only on the involvement of a wide range of specialist disciplines, but also on in-depth critical engagement with public values and concerns.
The Science Review was explicitly structured according to questions posed at an early stage in the Public Debate. The public also had an opportunity via the Science Review website to have an input into the Review, to engage with us and raise some concerns which we have addressed in our Second Report. Considerable efforts were made to ensure that the Science Review was as open as possible to inputs from stakeholders, interest groups and the wider public, as well as practising scientists. The conclusions contained in our First Report were carefully considered in relation to the findings of the Public Debate and other responses. Thorough attention was given to the diversity of scientific interpretations. In the end, conclusions drawn from the Science Review form one, albeit important, element to inform Government policy on the release, cultivation and consumption of GM crops. We believe there has been real value in the linkage between the Public Debate and the Science Review.

2.2.1 Agrawal AA &amp; Kotanen PM (2003) Herbivores and the success of exotic
plants: a phylogenetically controlled experiment. Ecol. Lett. 6, 712-715
Abstract: ëIn a field experiment with 30 locally occurring old-field plant species grown in a common garden, we found that non-native plants suffer levels of attack (leaf herbivory) equal to or greater than levels suffered by congeneric native plants. This phylogenetically controlled analysis is in striking contrast to the recent findings from surveys of exotic organisms, and suggests that even if ëenemy releaseí does accompany the invasion process, this may not be an important mechanism of invasion, particularly for plants with close relatives in the recipient flora.í
In our First Report (Section 6.2.5, pp. 116-117) we considered the invasiveness of alien species in the UK. We felt that: ëalthough a GM plant could theoretically become invasive, there was general agreement that equating current GM crops to exotic plants provides a very limited model for predicting the effects of gene flow and GM cropsí.
The particular sample of alien plants considered by the authors did not have significantly lower rates of attack by native herbivores than matched native species. But equally, the list of alien plants did not contain any species that are regarded as serious invaders of natural habitats, many (if not most) of which do show lower rates of herbivory than native plant species. In Britain, garden plant species of alien origin have much lower rates of herbivory than do native plant species. The ëenemy releaseí hypothesis is still the most plausible explanation of why some alien plants become highly invasive in alien environments, where they are freed from their specialist herbivores and prove (serendipitously, of course) to be unpalatable to the native generalist and specialist herbivores. ëEnemy releaseí is not the only factor involved, because many species freed from their enemies still do not become invasive. This study does not change the conclusions in our First Report.
2.2.2 Bais HP, Vepachedu R, Gilroy S, Callaway RM &amp; Vivanco JM (2003) Alleopathy and exotic plant invasion: from molecules and genes to species interactions. Science, 301, 1377-1380
Abstract: ëHere we present evidence that Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed), an invasive species in the western United States, displaces native plant species by exuding the phytotoxin (ñ)-catechin from its roots. Our results show inhibition of native species' growth and germination in field soils at natural concentrations of (ñ)-catechin. In susceptible species
14

such as Arabidopsis thaliana, the allelochemical triggers a wave of reactive oxygen species (ROS) initiated at the root meristem, which leads to a Ca2+ signaling cascade triggering genome-wide changes in gene expression and, ultimately, death of the root system. Our results support a ënovel weapons hypothesisí for invasive success.í
We considered whether GM plants could be invasive or persistent in Section 6.2 of our First Report. On page 112, we said that there was no evidence for allelopathic effects (or production of noxious products in general) in GM herbicide-tolerant crops studied so far.
Centaurea maculosa is highly invasive and this study shows it also to be allelopathic. But we don't know that it is invasive because it is allelopathic, it may for example be because it is unpalatable to cattle. A convincing case would be made by a phylogenetically controlled comparison of many plant species, which indicated that the allelopathic member of the pair was significantly more likely to be invasive than the non-allelopathic member. Such a study has not been done. This study does not change the conclusions in our First Report.
2.2.3 Chowdhury EH, Kuribara H, Hino A, Sultana P, Mikami O, Shimada N, Guruge KS, Saito M &amp; Nakajima Y (2003) Detection of corn intrinsic and recombinant DNA fragments and Cry1Ab protein in the gastrointestinal contents of pigs fed genetically modified corn Bt11. J. Animal Sci. 81, 2546-2551
This paper describes the fate of corn DNA fed to pigs and investigates both genes from the normal genome of maize and transgenic DNA. In both cases PCR methods demonstrated that DNA degradation was incomplete in the pig GI tract. The survival of 242 bp gene fragments of corn zein, 226 bp fragments of invertase, 1,028 bp fragments of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase were detected in the GI tracts of pigs fed both GM and non-GM corn. In the case of the transgene crylAb, 110 bp and 437 bp gene fragments were detected only in pigs fed GM maize.
We considered the fate of transgenic DNA in the GI tract in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 of our First Report. These additional observations do not change our original conclusion that DNA is incompletely degraded in the animal GI tract.
2.2.4 Defra (2003a) Quantifying landscape-scale gene flow in oilseed rape (OSR). Research Report RG0216 http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/research/epg-rg0216.htm
This report covers work at the Scottish Crop Research Institute on hybridisation rates in a landscape in eastern Scotland where oilseed rape (OSR) is widely grown. The results confirm earlier work by this group and others that show considerable site to site and year to year variation in patterns of cross pollination; with rates dropping rapidly over the first few tens of metres but declining only slightly with distance beyond that. Long distance pollination occurred on male sterile plants at 5 and 26 km from the nearest known pollen source (thought to be due to normal events but difficult to verify). Insects (including bees and pollen beetles) are the main agents of long distance pollination. The study reports that male-sterile 'bait' plants overestimate crossing in male fertile plants by an order of magnitude.
15

The study adds detail but does not materially affect the conclusions in Section 7.2 of our First Report: that separation will not guarantee seed purity, but might be used to reduce cross pollination levels to below 0.1%.
2.2.5 Defra (2003b) Gene flow monitoring from the GM crop FSE sites: monitoring gene flow from the GM crop to non-GM equivalent crops in the vicinity. Part 1: forage maize. Research Report EPG 1/5/138 http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/research/epg-1-5-138.htm
This study takes advantage of the GM Crop Farm-Scale Evaluations (FSEs) to monitor actual rates of hybridisation in the non-GM crops adjacent to the GM herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) maize crops. The findings are in line with expectations and confirm the statements in our First Report (Section 7.2). Rapid decreases in cross-pollination occurred within 20 metres and low levels were found at 80 and 200 metre separation distances. Patterns varied from site to site, but not significantly across sites between years. Separation distances of 24.5 metres would be required to reduce GM presence below a 0.9% threshold, and 80 metres is sufficient to achieve a threshold below 0.3% in maize crops.
2.2.6 Defra (2003c) The potential for oilseed rape feral (volunteer) weeds to cause impurities in later oilseed rape crops. Research Report RG0114 http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/research/epg-rg0114.htm
The Scottish Crop Research Institute and Central Science Laboratory undertook this study. The project examined whether feral OSR could persist in the environment for long enough and in high enough numbers to cause impurities in later crops.
There was a range of scientific objectives for the project. However, they can be summarised as follows:
(1) To consult widely with the industry and review the literature to define the perceived implications of introducing GM crops and the current situation with feral OSR.
(2) To develop existing model systems and operate them to produce output to demonstrate likely implications to the seedbank, emerging plants and harvested yield over a series of years.
(3) To compare the outputs of the model with measurements on feral populations in the field.
Feral OSR has become common in arable seedbanks since its introduction in the 1970s and appears to have persisted in some cases for 10 years. The typical seedbank population density of feral OSR is 100 m-2, which is small when compared to total weed seedbanks, but similar to the established stand density of an OSR crop. With OSR grown only every two to four years, as a break crop in a cereal rotation, and if only 1/100th of the feral seedbank germinated it would have a large impact on the impurity in the OSR crop (with a current EU threshold of 0.9%).
16

There is currently little information available on the persistence time and population density of feral OSR arising from GM varieties. Therefore, the models were developed and employed to examine the effects of various management practices on impurity in the seedbank, emerging feral plants and harvested yield.
The study modelled the arable system of two years of winter wheat and one year of winter OSR, with no attempt to control the feral population after the first harvest. It took 16 years after the initial OSR crop for impurity in yield to fall below 1%. However, the sensitivity of the system is such that if maximum germination were reduced from 90% to 80% the impurity after 16 years would be 10%. However, these suggested outcomes need to be seen as what could occur but would be unlikely in practice. It is highly unlikely that broadleaf weeds (including feral OSR) would not be managed during the winter wheat years of the rotation, except in field margins, which are not included in the model.
Where rigorous controls of the feral OSR were introduced into the model (involving complete eradication of emerged plants and prevention of seed production during wheat crops), the seedbank contamination, interpreted as yield contamination, was 0.01% after the 16th year and below the 1% threshold by the 10th year. Reducing seed lost at harvest from 5% to 1% could achieve this threshold within five years. However, as impurities also arise through sown seed, by gene flows between fields, and via survival of volunteer plants in field margins, thresholds of this order and timeframe would be difficult to attain in practice.
The model is being tested and refined against data collected in fields in which GM crops have been grown, ie the FSEs.
This study adds to the evidence discussed in Section 7.2.3 of our First Report, but does not change our original conclusions on crop to crop gene flow.
2.2.7 Defra (2003d) Modelling the effects on farmland food webs of herbicide and insecticide management in the agricultural ecosystem. Research Report EPG 1/5/188 http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/research/epg-1-5-188.htm
The objective of this report is to provide the framework for predicting the consequences of changes in farmland management and especially the introduction of GMHT crops. It also points out the areas where there are gaps in our knowledge and where further information is required.
It reviews the available literature on factors determining the seed and invertebrate availability for farmland birds; summarises the available information on the dynamics of the common farmland weeds; reviews the diet of each farmland bird species and collates the available information on functional responses.
It reviews the possible approaches for predicting the responses to the changes in agricultural practice such as the introduction of GMHT crops, changes in rotation and changes in the abundance of stubbles.
The main model within the report incorporates six weed species (Alepecurus myosuroides, Chenopodium album, Fallopia convolvulus, Papaver rhoeas, Poa annua, and Stellaria media)
17

within three possible rotations and with varying degrees of overwinter stubble. It then explores the consequences of changes in weed seed density on the abundance of generalised granivorous birds.
The report was written prior to the release of the FSE data, so the approach taken was to consider the extreme case of 100% weed mortality associated with GMHT crops in order to provide an upper bound on the possible response. The next stage is clearly to incorporate the full FSE data within such models. Such an approach is clearly essential to determine the long- term consequences of GMHT crops and place these changes within the context of other changes in the landscape such as agri-environment schemes.
We considered the ënew weed control strategies offered by GM herbicide-tolerant cropsí in Section 6.5 of our First Report and we noted the need for more studies on the impact of GMHT crops on farmland biodiversity in the UK. Since then the FSE results that have been published have helped to address this lack of knowledge (see Section 3). This study provides the basis for further work to help reduce uncertainty in this area.
2.2.8 Jackson AL, Bartz SR, Schelter J, Kobayashi SV, Burchard J, Mao M, Li B, Cavet G &amp; Linsley PS (2003) Expression profiling reveals off-target gene regulation by RNAi. Nature Biotechnology, 21, 635-637, Brief Communications
Abstract: ëRNA interference is thought to require near-identity between the small interfering RNA (siRNA) and its cognate messenger RNA (mRNA). Here, we used gene expression profiling to characterize the specificity of gene silencing by siRNAs in cultured human cells. Transcript profiles revealed siRNA-specific rather than target-specific signatures, including direct silencing of non-targeted genes containing as few as eleven contiguous nucleotides of identity to the siRNA. These results demonstrate that siRNAs may cross-react with targets of limited sequence similarity.í
Whilst this paper addresses siRNA in mammalian systems it draws attention to the possibility that the expression of genes other than the intended target may also be inhibited. In some cases this was explained on the basis of chance sequence similarity. 21-23 nucleotide siRNA has been widely used for inactivating gene expression in mammalian cells because introduction of large RNA molecules into mammalian cells often triggers cell death (apoptosis). In this regard, it is not unexpected that such small siRNA could silence off-target gene expression. However, this is not really relevant in plant systems where, broadly, the RNA-interference (RNAi) approach is used to silence a specific target gene. We mention gene silencing and RNAi in our First Report, mainly in Section 7.5, and this study does not change our conclusions.
Although specific RNA silencing can be induced by the shortest siRNA of 23 nucleotides in plant cells, suppression of plant gene expression is always achieved by long sequences (often more than a hundred nucleotides, and in many cases the whole target gene sequence), which have high specificity to the target gene. As a consequence, no off-target gene down-regulation by RNA silencing has been reported in plants, as the long RNAi molecules do not signal cell death in plants. For example, 700-nucleotide green fluorescent protein (GFP) works well in plants to silence a GFP gene but would kill animal cells. A good example of the use of RNAi in plant systems is the development of delayed ripening tomatoes in which the gene for
18

polygalacturonase is targeted so as to reduce pectin degradation during the fruit ripening process.
2.2.9 Kleter GA &amp; Peijnenburg AACM (2003) Presence of potential allergy- related linear epitopes in novel proteins from conventional crops and the implication for the safety assessment of these crops with respect to the current testing of genetically modified crops. Plant Biotech. J, 1, 371-380
This paper by Kleter and Peijnenburg indicates that there may be allergy-related linear epitopes in proteins in the mitochondria of non-GM male sterile plants due to rearrangements within the mitochondrial genome. Most of the protein sequences used in this paper had been predicted based on DNA sequences. In mitochondria, however, many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are modified ('edited') so that the sequence of the DNA does not at all represent the actual sequence of the mRNA and the protein. The authors therefore also included protein sequences derived from the edited forms of the corresponding mRNAs that had previously been described in literature. If one analyses the sequences of the DNA of the mitochondria of the male sterile plants examples can be found of stretches of six or seven amino acids that are identical to linear epitopes in some recognised allergic proteins. Essentially, the paper makes the point that these potential proteins are not subject to the same scrutiny as GM transgenic proteins. Furthermore, in our First Report we did indicate that conventionally bred crops are not subject to the same degree of scrutiny as GM ones. So, this paper does not appear to shed new light on the allergenicity issue.1
2.2.10 Lin H-X, Rubio L, Smythe A, Jiminez M &amp; Falk BW (2003) Genetic diversity and biological variation among California isolates of Cucumber mosaic virus. J. Gen. Virology, 84, 249-258
The data presented in this paper provide further evidence in support of the wider molecular virological principles and conclusions contained in our First Report (Section 7.5, pp. 235- 249).
GM plants resistant to virus diseases have been available since 1986 and, despite numerous actual research and commercial benefits, concerns have been raised over the possible development or emergence of new viruses that could overcome the genetically engineered resistance and affect virus and/or host plant ecology. It has been proposed that this could occur either through genetic recombination between an infecting mutant or related virus and the virus-derived transgene in the plant; or that a pre-existing natural sub-population of the target virus could exploit the new niche created by the GM resistant plants. Alternatively, since RNA viruses have a high rate of error-prone replication and hence genetic variation/evolution, the resistant GM plant could exert a strong selection pressure on the replicating population of viral RNAs (itself a ëquasi-speciesí) to favour one sequence variant which then dominates the virus population. This detailed and systematic study by Lin et al. addresses these possible scenarios.
Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is one of the most economically important plant viruses, with a wide range of hosts in over 365 genera, in over 85 families. CMV is endemic in all cucurbit- growing areas of the world and effective ëconventionalí genetic resistance is lacking in most varieties. Transgenic yellow crookneck squash plants expressing the coat protein (CP) genes
19

of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus and Watermelon mosaic virus (ëPrelude IIí), and CMV strain C (ëDestiny IIIí/íLiberator IIIí) were developed and marketed in 1995 and have shown good field resistance against their target (two or three) viruses.
No symptoms were seen, or CMV recovered from any transgenic Destiny III or Liberator III plant in two separate replicated field trials in 1999, despite widespread CMV-infections in adjacent non-GM susceptible or naturally resistant cucurbits, or in GM squash plants resistant to viruses other than CMV. Thus, 63 field isolates of CMV were obtained and compared with three ëstandardí CMV strains (Fny, Q and Ls) and 18 CMV field isolates collected between 1985-1994 (before transgenic CMV-resistant squashes were available) from various plants and areas of California. All 81 field isolates were later used for extensive CMV CP gene and downstream RNA sequence comparisons by single-strand (RNA) conformation polymorphism (SSCP); however, only 68 of the isolates could be purified from other co- infecting plant viruses.
The packaged genome of CMV consists of three different RNA components, a sub-genomic RNA that codes for the coat protein (CP), and (occasionally) one of several small ëparasiticí satellite RNAs. CMV thus has a complex genetic structure ideally suited to all manner of genetic reassortment, recombination and variation/mutation during RNA replication and/or (mixed) infections in susceptible cells. It is therefore notable that the authors found no correlation between CP gene sequence, geographical origin, collection year, original host plant species, or the ability of an isolate to overcome ëconventionalí or transgenic resistance in melon or squash.
The genetic diversity of all 81 Californian field isolates of CMV was analysed by SSCP, which classified them into 14 groups.
The 68 purified CMV isolates fell into five pathotypes based on their ability to infect and cause particular symptoms on three different cucurbit test plants (Dixie, a susceptible yellow crookneck squash; Destiny III (CMV-C CP transgenic Dixie) and Freeman (a conventional resistant cucumber variety)). The authors showed that 33 out of the 68 purified Californian field isolates of CMV could indeed infect young transgenic yellow crookneck squash plants (ëDestiny IIIí) when inoculated mechanically, at artificially high virus concentrations (c.f. normal aphid transmission). Significantly, 16 of these 33 isolates had been collected and stored between 1985-1994, before any genetic selection pressure to evade GM resistance existed. The remaining 17 isolates came from plants infected naturally in the field trials described above. No association was found between CMV CP gene sequence and biological characteristics such as the ability to infect natural (Freeman) or GM (Destiny III) resistant plants.
SSCP analysis was shown to be very sensitive for minor sequence variations, and that 32 out of the 33 CMV isolates were indistinguishable for a given isolate whether it came from Dixie (non-GM) or Destiny III (GM) isogenic hybrid pumpkins. One isolate (CK41) did show different but overlapping SSCP profiles between the two pumpkin types that may have been due to some selective effect of the transgenic resistance. However, further detailed analysis of CMV CP sequences from different plants revealed that the original CK41 had consisted of two sequence variants (differing by 7 nucleotides) in the CP gene region. One variant (A) dominated in both GM and non-GM pumpkin, while the other (B) appeared in conventionally resistant (Freeman) plants.
20

Thus the authors conclude that the anomalous SSCP profile seen for CK41-infected GM Destiny III plants was not due to recombination between the transgene (CMV-C CP) and the infecting virus. (CMV-C and CK41 in fact differ in their CP genes by 4.06 nucleotides per 100 nucleotides, as the authors show.) Nor was CK41 due to any selection pressure by the transgenic resistance because the same sequence changes were seen in non-GM pumpkin plants. CK41 most likely arose in the field through a mixed infection by two CMV isolates.
The conclusions presented in Section 7.5 of our First Report remain valid and are supported by these recent data.

In our First Report we made the point that effects of transgenes on non-target organisms should be investigated before commercial release (Section 6.3, Executive Summary page 14, and pp. 119-135). And we identified the need for better protocols to test, on a case-by-case basis, GM crop impacts on non-target species. This paper presents an example of this type of study. A virus of the fungus maize smut (Ustilago maydis) carries a gene for an anti-fungal protein (KP4), which has been transferred to transgenic wheat and gives the plants resistance to smut. Romeis et al. carry out a series of bioassays and a glasshouse plant study to see if the transgenic wheats have any effect on Folsomia candida, a representative of an important group of soil microarthropods that decompose organic matter in soil and are exposed to crop residues. A number of ëvery sensitive parametersí including insect development, egg cluster size and egg viability were measured. None of the parameters were affected when feeding on dried roots of KP4-transgenic wheat compared to untransformed controls, and there were no differences in the arthropod population development in pots of transgenic and control wheat grown in the glasshouse. Differences were detected between wheat varieties and between feeding on wheat and yeast.
2.2.12 Stewart CN, Halfhill MD &amp; Warwick SI (2003) Transgenic introgression from genetically modified crops to their wild relatives. Nature Reviews Genetics, 4, 806-817
This is a very comprehensive review of the area of our First Report covered in Chapter 7.3 and is very similar in emphasis. It explains the differences between hybridisation, gene flow and introgression and discusses the natural barriers to transgene introgression from crops to wild relatives (including linkage to genes of domestication). Crops are categorised into very low, low, moderate and high risk of introgression and the potential and merits of various techniques for reducing gene flow are discussed.
Although a review, covering the same literature as in our First Report, Stewart et al. confirm that Warwick et al. (2003) (in press when we produced our First Report) have produced the first evidence of transgene escape to a wild relative from a commercially released crop (herbicide tolerance from B. napus to weedy B. rapa in Canada). They also report a new study (Burke &amp; Rieseburg, 2003) of the consequences of introgression of a fitness-associated transgene into a wild relative (sunflowers), which showed that a disease resistance transgene did not increase the fitness of a wild plant.

This paper describes DNA transfer from six species of donor plants to the soil bacterium, Acinetobacter spp. using nptII as a marker for homologous recombination. Transfer was detected for both nuclear and plastid insertions of nptII, using intact tobacco leaves and intact tobacco and Arabidopsis plants in vitro. Transfer varied with plant genome size and the number of repeats of the transgenic DNA in the donor plant. Most importantly, transfer was not detected in the absence of a homologous nptII in the receptor bacteria. This observation extends the reports cited in our First Report, but it does not change the conclusion that marker rescue is a mechanism for the recovery of plant to bacterium gene transfer events. The dependence on DNA homology in the recipient bacteria is most important and fully addressed in our First Report.
2.2.14 Vlas·k J, ämahel M, PavlÌk A, Pavingerov· D &amp; BřÌza J (2003) Comparison of hCMV immediate early and CaMV 35S promoters in both plant and human cells. J. Biotechnol. 103, 197-202
It has been suggested that if the gene transcription promoter sequence (p35S) from a natural, common plant DNA virus (Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV)) was active in animal or human cells, then it may pose certain unique health risks. And, that these risks would be distinct from any risks created by our ingestion of all other food DNA-derived genes and/or promoter sequences. For example, if the CaMV p35S sequence could be taken up and functionally integrated into the chromosomal DNA of human or animal cells via ingestion of (unprocessed) transgenic (or CaMV-infected) plant food could it:
(1) inadvertently activate or enhance expression of growth regulator genes that may be located at the site of integration leading to possible hyperplasia/malignancy;
(2) reactivate dormant viruses; or
(3) recombine resulting in viruses with novel phenotypes (Ho et al. 1999)?
These proposals were discussed in our First Report (Section 7.5.3, pp. 244-245) and this paper is relevant to our response to the comments that we received on the significance of ërecombination hotspotsí in Section 4.3 of this report.
Vlas·k and colleagues cite earlier studies which have shown that the CaMV p35S sequence is active to varying degrees in all plant cells, in green algae, in yeast and in Escherichia coli, as well as in amphibian (Xenopus laevis) oocytes. In toad oocytes, various plant gene promoters, including p35S, and poly(A) signals were tested. p35S was found to be almost as efficient in driving reporter gene transcription as the mammalian SV40 promoter (Ballas et al. 1989). CaMV p35S was also found to be more efficient than the adenovirus-2 late promoter in HeLa cell-free transcription extracts (Burke et al. 1990). However, as both oocytes and HeLa cell
22

extracts have anomalous gene transcription activities, the authors conclude that more ëtypicalí animal cells should be studied.
Vlas·k and colleagues report on the relative levels of expression (transcription and translation) of a series of CaMV p35S and human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) DNA constructs which incorporated a popular reporter gene, bacterial β-glucuronidase (GUS). Transient transfection assays were used to compare the efficiency of expression of each DNA construct in potato leaf protoplasts and in human 293T kidney epithelial-type cells. Their data show that CaMV p35S-GUS activity was detectable in 293T cells, although at a level 4 orders of magnitude (i.e. 10,000 times) less than that obtained with the hCMV-GUS constructs. More unexpected and notable was the observation that, in potato leaf protoplasts, the hCMV promoter was only 2 orders of magnitude (i.e. 100 times) less active than the highly plant- active CaMV p35S promoter sequence.
The authors conclude by saying their work ëindicates that the potential hazards associated with the use of (CaMV) p35S may not be so serious as it is sometimes maintainedí. The authors continue to say ëit is questionable whether (the) relatively low transcription activity of (the) CaMV 35S promoter can induce such hazardous events in mammalian cells.í
The data presented are clear and convincing and add interesting new information to the field. However, the study also inevitably raises a number of new questions, such as: how, and why, is the hCMV promoter so active in plant cells; and what is the biological significance, if any, of this result?
Pairwise comparisons of each promoter-GUS gene construct were performed in three replicate experiments in each cell type. Absolute levels of GUS expression varied 2- to 4-fold between experiments, thus only relative levels of GUS gene expression are presented (+/- standard deviations). There was no quantification of the absolute or relative amounts of plasmid DNA (used at 2μg/μl) transfected into each cell sample using quantitative PCR, or by using a common promoter-reference gene construct, or by expression levels of a marker transcript. Some other points to bear in mind are:
(1) The CaMV p35S promoter ëshowed very low but measurable activityÖin human 293T-cells (0.01% activity of that revealed when using hCMV)í. In human 293 cells, without the SV40 T-antigen, both p35S and hCMV promoters gave 10- to 20-times less GUS activity than in 293T cells. Nevertheless, these transient (non-integrated DNA) assays clearly confirm that CaMV p35S can have some detectable activity in animal cells.
(2) The hCMV promoter is generally known to be the most efficient constitutive control element used in transient transfection assays in mammalian cells as evidenced by its broad use in commercially available gene expression vectors and its use to drive therapeutic gene expression within a human gene therapy context. Likewise, in most plant cells, the CaMV p35S promoter is known to be one of the most active, constitutive promoters available, hence its widespread use in transgenic plants. CaMV-driven transgene transcription (and optimal mRNA translation) typically produce a new protein at between 0.01-0.5% of total plant cell protein. Thus differences in the relative levels of activity of p35S and hCMV may be exaggerated, as each represents a highly efficient promoter in its own host cell types. Moreover, many endogenous housekeeping gene promoters compare very poorly in activity with
23

either CaMV p35S or hCMV, even in their homologous host cells. Thus, even very low levels of heterologous promoter-driven expression may be physiologically relevant, depending on the nature of the new gene expressed or sequence affected.
(3) As already noted for HeLa cell extracts and Xenopus oocytes, transcription factor activity varies greatly between cell types. It is therefore possible that CaMV p35S may function more efficiently in some animal cell types than in others, as it does for example in different plant cell types (meristem vs vascular vs mesophyll cells) in vivo. Thus, it would have been useful if more than one human or animal cell line had been incorporated in this type of analysis (i.e. more that 293 and 293T cells). Since the primary point of contact of intact or fragmented CaMV p35S-containing GM plant material would be various cell-types lining the GI tract, studies using a model for gut epithelial cells (e.g. Caco-2 cells) would have been appropriate. The unexpectedly high relative level of hCMV promoter activity in potato leaf protoplasts (and other plant cell types?) illustrates the unpredictability of such events and the need for sound experimental data.
(4) Although encouraging and interesting, these studies used convenient and relatively rapid transient transfection assays, in which various plasmid DNAs harbouring the gene constructs under test were not stably integrated into the heritable (nuclear) chromosomal DNA of the host cell (i.e. they all remained episomal). Assays measuring the relative (in)activity of p35S-GUS, or hCMV-GUS (or any other gene control sequence) integrated into the DNA of a heterologous cell may be generally informative, but can never eliminate completely the remote chance that a site-specific integration event (in the DNA of an homologous or heterologous host cell) could generate an unexpected result. Indeed, it is well documented that in both ëtraditionalí mutation breeding and modern GM breeding, greater or lesser numbers (respectively) of progeny plants are discarded, having undesirable phenotypes (traits) attributed to unpredicted genetic events during production. Experiments such as those by Vlasak et al. can only ever confirm that the CaMV 35S promoter is intrinsically less active in animal/human cells than in plants, and hence likely to be less risky.
Although fundamentally dependent on the intrinsic level of activity of the CaMV p35S promoter, the hypothetical risks proposed above (Ho et al. 1999) also depend upon some detrimental site-specific integration event. The uptake, stable integration, functional activity and inheritance of any food-derived DNA sequence (functional or non-functional) remains speculative.

This paper reports work referred to in our First Report (page 220) which attempts to provide an estimate of hybridisation rates in the UK between oilseed rape and the two forms of its wild relative B. rapa. Although rarer, hybridisation with the arable weedy ecotype are relatively higher than with the naturalised waterside form. The combination of methods used generate very high confidence ranges but, this aside, produce an order-of-magnitude estimate. Although absolute numbers of hybrids appear high (32,000 for waterside, 17,000 for weeds)
24

they represent around 0.04% of the wild B. rapa population. Most hybrids are produced in areas of sympatry (26,000 of the 32,000 waterside form) suggesting that regional variation could be exploited to reduce gene flow.
This study does not address the fate of the transgene (i.e. of plants bearing the transgene) in the new habitat into which it has been dispersed. Hybridisation is but the first step and estimates of hybrid fitness (dependent on the gene) and of introgression are important next steps. The number of hybrids found in this study represents a very small proportion of the wild B. Rapa population, but fitness and introgression are more important than initial numbers. Backcrossing, for example, would put the transgene into a genetic background that is increasingly dominated by wild-type genes and thus more likely to have increased fitness. Whether the transgene increases in frequency or the plants bearing the gene increase in abundance would need to be addressed by comparative field experiments over several years in the natural habitats in question.

Section 3
THE GM CROP FARM SCALE EVALUATIONS
3.1 INTRODUCTION
The first part of this Section briefly describes the research and some of the findings reported by the GM Crop Farm-Scale Evaluation (FSE) research team. This is followed by the Panel’s interpretation of the evidence, followed by commentary on the broad implications of this work.
3.2 THE ISSUE
In Section 6.5 of our First Report, we drew attention to a lack of detailed knowledge of the potential impacts on biodiversity following the introduction of GM herbicide tolerant (GMHT) crops. Studies that systematically compared the effects of GMHT and conventional management regimes were available, but usually confined to small-scale studies at research stations or observations in commercial fields. At least five studies had shown that using GMHT crops generally increased the efficiency and reliability of weed control in maize, beet, and oilseed rape (Read &amp; Bush 1998, Strandberg &amp; Pederson 2002, Wevers 1998, Read &amp; Ball 1999a, Read &amp; Ball 1999b). Only one commentary (Firbank &amp; Forcella 2000) suggested that weed control was sometimes less efficient than conventional methods when GMHT varieties were used. The Panel also raised the possibility that the use of GMHT cropping systems could have an impact on spray damage to field boundary and hedgerow biodiversity.
The First Report also drew attention to potential impacts of GMHT cropping on taxa other than plants. In this case, there was little scientific information, although some research was available on possible impacts of delayed herbicide spraying of GMHT crops on insect populations. A modelling study had investigated potential impacts of changes in herbicide use associated with GMHT crops upon skylarks.
Section 6.5 of our First Report identified as an important issue whether GMHT management would be more or less harmful to wildlife than conventional cropping, and posed the key questions:
‘Will delayed herbicide applications in GMHT crops allow more weeds, more invertebrates and, for example, improved breeding productivity of birds? Or will the efficiency and reliability of weed control mean fewer resources for seed predators such as granivorous birds, and declining weed populations in the long term?’
In Section 6.5.4 of our First Report, we reported that there is general agreement that there have been substantial declines in biodiversity in the UK in recent decades and that the evidence is stronger for birds and plants than for invertebrates. However, there is growing scientific acceptance that these declines have been caused by agricultural intensification. We noted that there is less evidence (particularly environmental evidence), and therefore less general agreement, to indicate the relative contributions of herbicides per se in these declines;
27

but that there is, however, general agreement that declines in weed seed resources have played a major role in the dramatic declines of seed-eating farmland birds.
In Section 6.5.7, we looked forward to the outcome of the UK Government-funded FSEs of GMHT crops to help resolve this issue. This study has been running for four years, investigating the impacts on biodiversity of herbicide regimes associated with GMHT maize, beet and oilseed rape compared to herbicide application on non-GM crops. The results of the studies on spring-sown varieties of these crops are now available; the results of research on winter-sown oilseed rape to follow next year.
3.3 THE RESEARCH
The FSEs are the largest manipulative experiment ever carried out on farmland ecology anywhere in the world, exceeding by more than threefold any comparable experiment undertaken previously (Perry et al. 2003). The researchers, a consortium of experienced ecologists and statisticians overseen by an independent steering committee, organised the planting of 273 trial fields around England and Scotland. Data from 201 fields were eventually used in the final analyses. Each field was divided into two: half was sown with the GMHT crop and half with its conventional equivalent. To avoid experimental bias, treatments were allocated randomly to field halves. Farmers managed the fields using their normal herbicide regime on the conventional half, and a spray regime on the GMHT part that was consistent with cost-effective weed control, based on recommendations from the agrochemical manufacturers and an industry body (SCIMAC). The researchers checked that these management practices were being carried out properly, and that herbicide applications on the conventional parts of fields represented normal farming practice.
Crops were grown as part of farmers’ normal crop rotations. These three crops are ‘break’ crops, usually grown as part of a rotation that includes other crops such as wheat or barley. This means that the GM crop was often grown for only one year in a specific field, with the exception of a few maize sites where continuous cropping was practised.
Within the fields, researchers measured weed diversity and abundance, seed rain and weed seed banks. Assessments were also made of weed seed banks and weed seedlings in plots following the GMHT management. Within the crops, various standard methods were used to assess the relative abundance and diversity of invertebrates, including slugs and snails, insects and spiders. Bee and butterfly transects were also used to assess the foraging preferences of these insects. Plants and invertebrates were also assessed in field margins, field verges and in field boundaries such as hedges and ditches where these were present. Estimates of crop cover and development were also made to assess whether any differences between the characteristics of the GM and conventional crops per se could be affecting the results.
The strengths of this experimental design are:
• High statistical power derived from the large number of sites and split field design. This meant that the experiment was able to detect relative small changes in numbers of organisms affected by the different herbicide applications. The overall size of the trials was determined by a ‘power analysis’. This used existing data on weed and invertebrate numbers and their variability to arrive at a target of 65 fields for each crop type. The targets were met over the duration of the experiment. The numbers of fields
28

were set to detect over 80% of 1.5 fold differences in abundance between treatments at a statistically significant level; in the event 82% of such differences were significant, fully in line with the targets.
• The wide variety of organisms sampled and measured (1.5 million invertebrates and 0.5 million seeds). Statistical analyses were not only able to detect variation in different taxa between treatments, but could also be analysed by looking at the effects of treatments on species grouped by trophic (feeding) level, revealing impacts on food webs.
• Field management was carried out by a group of farmers representative of the range of cropping practices used in different regions of the UK. This was more likely to reflect the realities of any commercial introduction of GMHT crops than previous small-scale experiments confined to research stations.
• A wide variety of sites reflecting different farming intensities were selected over a wide geographic range, spread over several years with varying weather conditions.
3.4 THE RESULTS
The results were published in October 2003 as a series of papers in a theme issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (Squire et al. 2003; Champion et al. 2003; Heard et al. 2003a &amp; 2003b; Brookes et al. 2003; Haughton et al. 2003; Roy et al. 2003; Hawes et al. 2003). This group has also published a commentary on the implications of their work (ISBN 0-85521-036-2).
The results were remarkably consistent and clear. The results showed overall, that animal and plant life was most abundant in conventional oilseed rape fields, with more butterflies, weeds and seeds in these fields than in those of GMHT rape, where a different herbicide was used. A similar picture emerged for biodiversity in beet fields, but here bees were significantly less abundant on the GMHT side. There were, however, more springtails, small insects feeding on plant debris, in GMHT beet and rape fields in summer than in the conventional fields. The research showed that these were feeding on dead weeds after the GM crops had been sprayed. A ground beetle that feeds on springtails was also more abundant in the GMHT beet and rape fields.
In maize fields a contrasting picture has emerged from the research. Conventional maize fields (where a powerful residual herbicide, atrazine, is commonly used) were found to be the least abundant in animal and plant life, with relatively more weeds, seeds, and insects occurring in the GMHT maize.
These results were consistent not only from year-to-year but also from area-to-area, indicating that how farmers manage their fields has a far greater effect on biodiversity than variations in weather or soil-type. The results showed that conventional beet and spring rape crops were in general, more abundant in plants, seeds and animals than the GMHT crops because the broad- spectrum herbicides used on the GM crops were more effective at controlling weeds than the selective herbicides used on conventional crops. Conversely, the residual herbicide regimes used in conventional maize are more effective, in general, at controlling weeds than the broad-spectrum herbicide applied over the GMHT maize.
29

Analysis of the impacts of the different herbicides on trophic levels within fields demonstrated that effects on weeds were reflected through food webs, with reductions in weeds causing reductions in invertebrates feeding on plants and consequent reductions in predators, although not all the organisms sampled in these studies declined. In maize and oilseed rape fields, the effects of GMHT management regimes on invertebrates were less marked than in beet.
Field margins can support a high diversity of plant species and are important for conservation within farmed landscapes in Europe. Margin vegetation was recorded in three components of the field margin. No marked effects of GMHT crops were found on plants and invertebrates living in the field verge or boundary. Effects in the tilled margins of fields were similar to those recorded within the crop, as they were subject to the same herbicide regimes. There was a significant reduction in seed-producing weeds, flowering plants and butterflies (in July) in the tilled margins of GMHT beet and oilseed rape. The effect was reversed in maize fields, where significant increases in weeds and flowering plants were recorded in the margins of GMHT fields. Effects on butterflies mirrored the effects on vegetation. The likely cause is the lower nectar supply in GMHT field margins and cropped edges. Few large differences were found for bees, gastropods or other invertebrates. Scorching of vegetation by herbicide spray drift was significantly higher on field verges adjacent to all three GMHT crops, although the areas affected were very small in relation to the total length of verge.

3.5 THE PANEL’S VIEW ON THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE FROM THE FSES
The FSEs are one of the largest ecological experiments that have taken place on farmland. The Panel agrees that the data sets produced by this research are unusually large and that the statistical methods used both for design and analyses were valid and robust. The FSEs give a clear picture of the changes in biodiversity caused by the different herbicide regimes used on GMHT and conventional crops of maize, beet and spring oilseed rape.
The design of the FSE experiments attempted to capture the current range and intensities of farming practices across the UK. Given that the sites used in these experiments varied greatly in species composition, geographic location and crop management, we agree that the effects of GMHT management on biodiversity are a fair representation of what would actually happen if widespread adoption of GMHT crops and weed management regimes were to take place as set out in the FSEs.
The researchers conclude that because there were significant differences between treatments for each crop, but the effects were not the same for each crop, there was no evidence that treatment effects had arisen because the crops had been produced using transgenic technology. In addition, there were no significant effects on crop pests (rather than those that lived on weeds) suggesting that the crop itself had no effect on invertebrates. They showed that the differences could be explained entirely by the effects of contrasting herbicide regimes used on GMHT and conventional crops. We agree with this and therefore note that the conclusions of the experiment would apply equally if similar herbicide tolerance were to be
30

introduced into these crops using other forms of plant breeding, such as mutation breeding or marker-assisted breeding that are not regulated in the same way as transgenic technologies.
3.6 IMPLICATIONS FOR FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY
3.6.1 What we know
The results show that the adoption of GMHT beet and oilseed rape, if managed as they were in the FSEs, would result in fewer weeds, seeds, butterflies and bees (bee activity was only significantly lower in beet) in and around these fields. Not only was there a significant reduction in weeds in these crops, but also a large reduction in weed seed production and return of seeds to the soil, especially seeds from broad-leaved plants. These differences, if compounded over time, could result in a large decrease in population densities of arable weeds. On the basis of the available seed bank data, Heard et al. (2003b) conclude that there is the potential for an accelerated decline in the abundance of weed seed species under GMHT beet and spring oilseed rape management, in the order of an additional 7% per year for arable rotations1, over and above the current generally accepted annual 3% decline in weed seed banks in the UK since the 1940s.
The results are clear and show that overall, GMHT beet and spring oilseed rape crops, if managed as they were in the FSEs, would provide fewer nectar resources for pollinating insects (bees and butterflies) and fewer weed seed resources for granivorous birds.
By contrast, GMHT maize resulted in more weeds in this crop in summer. This could result in more food resources for birds in and around GMHT maize fields, and raises the prospect of leaving weedy stubbles following maize cultivation, with potential benefits to wintering wildlife. Weedy stubbles do not usually result from our current atrazine-based weed control in conventional maize.
3.6.2 Uncertainty
The main uncertainties that remain concerning the impact of these GMHT crops on farmland biodiversity (were they to be given commercial approval in the EU) are the degree of uptake of the crops by farmers (acreage and distribution); the nature of the farms involved (e.g. would participating farmers tend to be from farms with current high or low weed burdens?); and how closely any future management of these crops mimic those studied in the FSEs (e.g. in particular, the similarity or otherwise of herbicide regimes). The significance of the impact on wildlife will also be dependent upon the wider landscape setting.
It is therefore not possible to predict the scale of potential effects at the current time. However, the evidence from the FSEs suggest that the herbicide regime associated with the large scale cropping of GMHT maize, compared with conventional maize, could be of benefit to farmland wildlife, with increased levels of weeds that may be of value to granivorous birds, whereas those associated with GMHT cropping of beet and spring oilseed rape will be of
1 In a five course cereal rotation with a break crop grown every 5 years (e.g. Watkinson et al. 2000). 31
 
disbenefit compared with the conventional crops, providing fewer nectar resources for pollinators and fewer weed seed resources for granivorous birds.
It would be useful to develop ecological models using the raw data from the FSEs to investigate these issues further.
3.7 LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
(What are the potential developments in this area and do they affect the Panel’s conclusions?)
The interpretation of the maize results has been complicated somewhat by the recent announcement that atrazine will be banned within the EU because of its unfavourable environmental profile. Atrazine, a residual herbicide, was the most commonly used weed killer on conventional maize in the FSEs. It is possible that the herbicides that replace atrazine in maize will be as effective in weed control, but it is also possible that they will not. Further analysis to compare the biodiversity impacts of the GMHT maize management with the few conventionally cropped fields where atrazine was not used might be informative but, because of the low numbers of these fields, this may not be statistically sufficient.
The FSEs not only gave a clear and consistent answer to the important issue of impacts on biodiversity of GMHT cropping identified in our First Report, but also gave a deep insight into the wildlife that lives in and around the crops tested (Figure 1). This experiment was the first time that the impact on biodiversity of a novel cropping system has been assessed before large-scale commercial use of the system. The experimental protocol could be used not only to assess the wildlife impacts of future cropping systems but could also be used to look at the long-term impacts of existing systems such as winter cropping and general agrochemical applications on farmed land. The methods used in the FSEs could be used, for example, to assess the indirect impacts of herbicides and other agrochemicals used in conventional cropping, or to compare the biodiversity associated with conventional cropping to that in organic systems or other farming approaches such as integrated pest management (IPM). Analysis of the FSE data may suggest some alternative smaller-scale approaches for the future.
There have been vast changes to agricultural practice over the last 50 years – changes in crops, in farm management, rotations, change to autumn sown and spring sown crops. It is important to place GMHT crops in the context of past and future changes. The FSE data, and more that will follow, offer modelling opportunities to assess the longer term and large-scale implications of this work, and will contribute to informing debate on broader agricultural issues related to societal choices and the balance of natural resources.
Looking at the broad context, the results underscore how crop production and wildlife are irrevocably linked in farming. These trials give numerical possibilities in allowing us to measure, interpret and manipulate the balance between resources for human beings and for wildlife. Striking the balance between the landscapes we want and the food we need is a much broader issue that is beyond the immediate context of this review and would need to consider changes in crop rotation practice, hedge and headland management and a broad range of wildlife stewardship objectives.

3.8 CONCLUSIONS
If all else remains constant and the three crops are introduced and managed in the way they were in the trials, then for GMHT beet and spring oilseed rape a significant reduction would be expected in weed biomass and weed seed return resulting in fewer nectar resources for pollinators and fewer weed seed resources for granivorous birds. For GMHT maize the opposite is expected. These effects arise from the crop management regimes associated with these GMHT crops (i.e. the herbicide application) and are probably not a direct consequence of the way the crops have been bred.
These data, and more that will follow, offer modelling opportunities to assess the longer-term and large-scale implications of this work, and will contribute to inform debate on broader agricultural issues related to societal choices and the balance of natural resources.
3.9 RELEVANCE TO OTHER PARTS OF OUR FIRST REPORT 3.9.1 Herbicide applications, loads and effects
As mentioned in our First Report, there is no clear relationship between amounts of herbicide and biodiversity impact (Section 6.5.3). The FSE results provide an example where less herbicide was added to the GMHT beet and oilseed rape compared with the non-GM counterparts yet the impacts on certain classes of wildlife were greater.
In Section 6.5.6, of our First Report, we identified a gap in knowledge in terms of information on number of applications; the number of active ingredients used and the number of tractor passes needed, in comparison to conventional weed control systems. Evidence from North America was equivocal. For example, a review of various studies on glyphosate-resistant soybean cropping showed results varying between a 7% increase and a 40% decrease in total herbicide use with the HT crop (Hin et. al. 2001). The fewer passes over fields brings with it other potential environmental benefits such as reduced energy costs and emissions. We noted that the herbicide cropping regimes for the GMHT varieties in the FSEs required lower inputs to achieve similar or greater levels of weed reduction in terms of numbers of active ingredients and tractor passes. The reductions in the application of these chemicals may have advantages2.
3.9.2 Relationship to other studies
In our First Report the potential benefits of the GMHT herbicide regimes in terms of simplicity of weed control, the flexibility of weed control and potential benefits and biodiversity gains were discussed (Section 6.5.3). Two separate studies (Strandberg &amp; Pedersen 2002; Dewar et al. 2003) considered in our First Report (Section 6.5.3) suggested that by using GMHT beet, applications of broad spectrum herbicides could be delayed, leaving weeds in the fields for longer. It was suggested that this might benefit farmland birds because more weeds would yield more invertebrates for them to eat. The FSEs did not test

this, because farmers were managing the GM parts of the fields to optimise crop yield, not biodiversity, and applied the herbicides earlier in the season. In these parts of the FSE fields, compared to the conventional parts, there were more springtails and their predators feeding on decaying weeds, but these occurred in late summer when breeding birds’ chicks would be unlikely to be feeding in the fields. There was also very little weed seed available for wintering birds in the GMHT beet because although weeds were killed later than in conventional beet, mortality occurred before they had set seed.
3.9.3 Case-by-case assessment
Growing GMHT beet and oilseed rape had similar impacts on biodiversity despite the fact that they carried transgenes giving tolerance to two different herbicides, with beet tolerant to glyphosate, a translocated herbicide, and oilseed rape tolerant to glufosinate ammonium, a contact herbicide. That the conclusions of these experiments were different for different crops with GMHT traits reinforces our general conclusion in our First Report that impacts of GM crops must always be assessed case-by-case.

FEEDBACK ON THE FIRST REPORT
4.1 INTRODUCTION
An important element in the GM Science Review has been the opportunity presented to all to contribute, drawing attention to developments in the science and giving views on their significance. The Panel considered peoples’ contributions at open meetings, and to the Science Review website during the first phase of the Review. This helped document a ‘range of views’ on the issues from which we sought to produce a balanced review. There has been a great deal of interest in our First Report. Website data indicate that over 20,000 copies have been downloaded so far.
As part of the second phase of the Review, we invited comments on our First Report. These can be viewed on the Science Review website1 and a list of those individuals and organisations who commented is given in Annex I. Despite the large interest in the Report, relatively few individual members of the public took up the invitation to send us comments. In total, there were 54 electronic and 12 written responses from individuals and organisations. Broadly, the Report was regarded as a valuable document by a wide cross-section of respondents (including leading scientific research institutions, leading non-Governmental organisations (NGOs), conservation bodies, and industry). It was seen as consensus building, recognising public concerns about the technology and providing an important new initiative in an otherwise increasingly polarised debate. Against this favourable response, some continuing concerns were expressed. This section addresses comments on the First Report on which we thought a response would be helpful to deliver our remit of evaluating the current state of scientific knowledge on issues of public concern.
To help us identify these particular comments we looked for:
• concerns raised over the framework or what the commentator saw as presumptions on which parts of the discussion in our First Report are based;
• concerns raised over the completeness or interpretation of evidence in our First Report; and
• peer reviewed scientific literature cited, but not referred to in our First Report.
We have not responded to every specific comment that has been made. For example, some comments were opinions not supported with peer reviewed scientific evidence and others offered interpretations, which we had already considered as part of the range of views in the First Report.

For each of the ‘science’ chapters contained in our First Report (i.e. Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7), Sections 4.2-4.5 below we:
(1) summarise the main conclusions in our First Report, as contained in the relevant parts of the executive summary;
(2) summarise all the main issues raised by commentators; and (3) provide the Panel’s response, where appropriate.
4.2 CHAPTER 4: HOW RELIABLE IS GM PLANT BREEDING? 4.2.1 Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Concern has been expressed that GM plant breeding is too unreliable and imprecise for crops to be grown and consumed safely, or at least without more extensive testing. One argument presented is that it is necessary to produce about 100 GM plants to obtain one that has the desirable characters for its use as a basis of a new GM crop variety. There is also evidence that genes introduced by genetic modification vary in their effects depending on precisely where they insert into the host plant’s genetic material.
To address such concerns it is important to place GM crop breeding in the context of non-GM crop breeding methods such as gene transfer by pollination, mutation breeding, cell selection and induced polyploidy. Most of these so-called conventional plant breeding methods have a substantially greater discard rate. Mutation breeding, for instance, involves the production of unpredictable and undirected genetic changes and many thousands, even millions, of undesirable plants are discarded in order to identify plants with suitable qualities for further breeding. The success of all methods of breeding relies on careful testing and evaluation and on rejection of plants with undesirable qualities. The rejection rate is substantially higher for most non-GM crop breeding methods than it is for GM crop breeding.
All plant breeding methods, however, have unique features and the main special feature of GM plant breeding is that it allows a wider choice of genes for modifying crops in novel ways. No other plant breeding technique permits the incorporation of genetic material from such diverse biological sources. Inevitably this raises the possibility that some new consequences of GM plant breeding may be unexpected. This presents challenges for their regulation and management in the future that will need to be managed carefully and intelligently.’
4.2.2 Main points made by commentators
Some commentators considered that Chapter 4 of our First Report was balanced and rigorous and thought that placing the GM issue in the context of existing plant breeding methods was useful and appropriate2 3 4 5 6. However, other commentators 7 8 9 10 stated that because GM

plant breeding starts with a molecular genetic manipulation process that has (in their view) no resemblance to other breeding technologies, comparing it with other breeding techniques placed it in the wrong context detracting attention from fundamental, generic technical and conceptual differences between GM and non-GM methods (especially natural reproductive processes), and failed to place GM within the context of our latest understanding of gene organisation and function. Some commentators7 stated that features of the transformation process such as the breaking and joining of DNA of the host genome at many unspecified locations ‘illegitimate recombination’ and substantial scrambling of both foreign and host DNA at the sites of integration were unique features not mentioned in our First Report. Moreover, it was stated that the ‘successes’ in GM are unstable, are prone to further changes, including the silencing of foreign genes, further rearrangements of DNA and loss of genetic material, all of which is unique to the GM process. The selection of transgenes in active regions of the genome also meant there was maximum possibility for gene disruption leading to cascading effects on a whole variety of genes. The removal of genes out of their normal context and randomly inserting them in a totally new genomic environment, would first lead to ‘position effects’ that result in a highly variable level, spatial and temporal pattern of transgene function and secondly a disruption of host gene function. It was argued that these are unique and generic properties of GM technology and therefore apply to all new varieties of crop plants produced in this manner. It was further stated that as a result of these generic properties associated with the use of GM in agriculture, the case-by-case assessment of GM crops is not applicable at the early stage of their development.
It was stated that current models of gene organisation no longer view genes as independent isolated units of information but depict genes to be organised into ‘functional domains’ and show that genes exist, are regulated, and work within complex interconnected networks. It is argued that this contemporary view of genome structure and function explains why GM is inefficient and imprecise. On this basis, other views expressed by this group8 included the notion that natural sexual reproduction methods used in plant breeding preserve the complex gene organisation and regulatory networks that have evolved over vast periods of time and which are vital for whole plant functional integrity. Other breeding methods for producing new plant varieties which disrupt the preserved natural genetic order, including GM, had to be looked at very carefully because these methods would result in major unintended effects with unpredictable consequences. A related criticism was that the use of agronomic criteria to assess GM as presented in this chapter continued to hold onto the now outmoded view that genes are isolated units of information, which as a result can be moved between organisms with totally predictable outcomes11 12. The whole report was predicated on the reductionism view of the science of genetics, and the role that this theory states that DNA plays.
Some stated that because of these effects (as well as the chromosomal and point mutations associated with the tissue culture steps that accompany transformation processes), the sum total of unintended effects might not be seen until the crop was approved and grown for a

number of years. Of relevance to this argument were another two points raised by these commentators who disagreed: (1) that mutagenesis, tissue culture and wide crosses are widely used in conventional plant breeding; and (2) that much of the risk arising from random genetic mutations and other procedures produced by these methods is removed by backcrossing. However, some GM crops varieties released commercially appear to have never been backcrossed, including all transgenic varieties of potato and papaya.
Marker assisted breeding (MAB) was suggested13 as a more generally acceptable way forward for the use of biotechnology in agriculture.
4.2.3 The Panel’s overall response
Genes, and gene products, do not act in isolation. They interact with each other and the environment in complex and incompletely understood ways. It is clear that if you introduce novel genes (by conventional as well as GM means) into a plant, as a consequence, interactions with other plant genes or their products may occur in novel and unpredictable ways. This raises the possibility that such novel interactions may include the production of substances that could potentially be harmful to human health or the environment.
Are there unexpected effects that arise from the production of GM plants? The answer is sometimes ‘yes’. Examples exist in the literature, and anecdotally, that when transgenes are put into plants it is not uncommon to observe changes that you don’t expect. Such effects may arise at least in part as a consequence of the fact that genes introduced into GM plants insert at random locations in the genome, and may disrupt the function of other genes. It may activate or inhibit expression of one or more of the plant’s own genes. Similar disruptions may also occur during other steps when producing GM plants, including extensive tissue culture or plant regeneration methods. The widely accepted view in biological research and plant breeding is that there are some parallels in the properties of GM and non-GM plant breeding methodologies but important differences too. De facto, GM is regulated because a special feature of GM breeding is that it allows the transfer into crop plants of one or a few genes from radically different organisms opening up new possibilities for application as well as uncertainties, which we need to look at on a case-by-case basis. In Europe, both the process and the product are regulated, giving several points at which extra requirements and scrutiny are invoked in recognition of the special attributes of this technology.
An important question is whether unpredicted effects are more likely to arise with GM methods than with classical plant breeding methods? This depends very much on the type of conventional plant breeding that is carried out and, the nature of the genetic modification and the method used to achieve it. There is evidence that both the genetic modification and the tissue culture process used to achieve it, both introduce genetic variation, some of which is expected, and some of which is not. Conversely conventional methods of breeding using tissue culture can introduce considerable genetic and chromosomal variation, and this is influenced by the precise method of tissue culture used and the time spent in the tissue culture phase. There are also other examples of (non-GM) conventional crosses that generate significant amounts of genetic variation, so it depends very much on the particular comparisons that are made. The key point is that all conventional methods we have used to

 40

generate food crops since plant breeding and selection began 10,000 years ago will have produced effects which we cannot necessarily predict because of the extraordinary complexity of the systems we are dealing with. What conventional breeding has shown is that it is possible to disrupt or scramble the genome in such as way as to cause random and major genomic damage and yet recover plants that are valuable improvements and regarded as having a safe history of use. So ‘genetic damage’ leading to unintended effects is not unique to GM but the consequences may be, depending on the properties of the new genetic material that is being incorporated.
Does GM offer enhanced opportunities for delayed unintended effects and what are the prospects for detecting adverse effects before commercialization? The answer to the first part of the question is possibly, in some cases. The answer to the second part concerns the assessment practices in place before commercialization and how effective they are. In this respect, it is important to appreciate that plant breeders do not just introduce a novel gene, pick a line and place it on the market. There is selection during the breeding program, as in conventional breeding programs, and most plants are rejected. In addition, GM crop varieties need to satisfy the requirements of variety registration as well as the GM legislation system, predicated on safety, and to answer the question: are any of these effects harmful? However, it is not unusual for conventional crops that are placed on the market to show unanticipated effects after commercialization. The same logic therefore applies to GM crops and this presents similar challenges, although the GM regulatory system is special in requiring post market monitoring.
So the question arises, are the current regulatory systems in Europe adequate to address these effects? The degree of uncertainty is related to our ability to detect and interpret changes, at the molecular and agronomic level. The current, widely accepted view among biological researchers and plant breeders is that the methods for evaluation of the current generation of GM crops for food and feed in the European regulatory framework are robust when applied consistently. However, a minority holds the contrary view and this point is picked up in more detail in the main body of our First Report. Regulatory evaluation needs to keep pace with the challenges posed by new developments in technology and also recognise and respond to progress in our understanding and knowledge. It is important that further research to ensure effective risk assessment is supported. It is also important in the UK that regulatory oversight is proportionate to the degree of risk and uncertainty, which recognises the distinct attributes of GM as well as its parallels with conventional crop breeding.
4.2.4 The Panel’s response to specific points The focus of the chapter
Chapter 4 of our First Report considered the question ‘How reliable is GM plant breeding?’. This was prompted by one of the questions raised by the public, which was: Does GM work? A concern was expressed that ‘The process is haphazard, 90% of all attempts to modify organisms fail, and some experiments and trials have been halted because side effects emerge’14. As a primary focus of the Science Review was to address issues raised by the public, it was considered important to include this in our First Report. Comparisons with the

many methods used in non-GM breeding over the past 50–100 years provides an important context to illustrate the point that there is imprecision associated with all breeding approaches and that is it is not a unique feature of GM plant breeding, and secondly, to demonstrate that crops with a safe history of use have resulted from plant breeding programmes that have involved massive structural genetic rearrangements.
It was not the intention of Chapter 4 of our First Report to underplay the distinctive attributes of genetic modification. On page 49 we state in the summary that ‘The current and widely accepted view within the biological research and plant breeding community is that there are important parallels between non-GM and GM plant breeding although in certain respects GM breeding techniques differ significantly’. Nor was it our intention to underplay the potential novel sources of uncertainty; and in the Executive Summary of our First Report we stated, ‘Inevitably this raises the possibility that some new consequences of GM plant breeding may be unexpected’. We described some of the mechanisms that could give rise to novel sources of variation associated with GM crops. For example, on page 53, we pointed out that genes introduced into plants by genetic modification can cause insertion mutations in resident genes (‘illegitimate recombination’), that variation in the border sequences inserted into different transgenic plants can occur and that where tissue culture steps are included in the transformation procedures these can be associated with a whole range of changes. Other molecular events associated with gene technologies discussed were gene silencing, variation and position effects (page 55). The joint NGO comments (page 6) describe the molecular mechanisms by which a transgene might activate or inhibit expression of one or more of the plant’s own genes which could potentially lead to a whole range of unanticipated effects. Many of these mechanisms are plausible.
Gene order
It is clear that genetic linkages can have adaptive significance. Ultimately natural selection and evolution selects adapted organisms at many levels, including at the level of genomic organisation and function. This will include spatial and temporal control of genes, but also genetic recombination at meiosis, sexual fertility and breeding system. The common evolutionary origin of species, along with the biological and adaptive significance, is the reason why gene order can be preserved between evolutionary diverse organisms. Evolutionary biology and comparative genomics tell us that gene orders arising from natural sexual reproduction change constantly throughout evolution (a comparison of conservation and rearrangement between rice and Arabidopsis gives some quantitative data (Mayer et al. 2001) or Arabidopsis and Brassicas (Lukens et al. 2003)).
Breaking gene order
It is also clear that rearranging these linkages happens not only during plant speciation but is a valuable source of genetic variation that has been used to considerable success in plant breeding. For example, some wheat varieties in commercial use carry a fragment from a rye chromosome. Tissue culture destabilises genetic systems, wide crosses and mutations do the same, and yet crop plants that have been regarded as safe have been recovered from such programmes. Naturally occurring transposons have been implicated in generating some of this variation in all these systems.

Plant breeders have induced (‘illegitimate’) recombination events and scrambled the genome for many decades by wide hybridisation and mutagenesis. Chemical or radiation breeding causes point mutations, breaks in chromosomes, chromosome translocations (chromosome inversions and interchanges), loss and duplication of genetic material (aneuploidy, nullisomy, disomy, trisomy, tetrasomy) and fragmentation of chromosomes. Often the level of mutagen treatment is set to cause sufficient mutation (or ‘genetic damage’) to give about 50% plant mortality (LD50). A recent study by Kashkush et al. (2002) reports that gene loss, silencing and activation accompany the development of wheat allotetraploids widely used in conventional wheat breeding and variety development programmes.
A wide array of ‘illegitimate’ genetic changes is also a feature of somaclonal variation occurring in plant tissue culture. In the 1980s the somaclonal method of inducing genetic variation was used by many breeders for seed and vegetatively propagated crops. Many millions of breeding lines were evaluated under field conditions at that time. In the case of sexually propagated crops it was possible to backcross to eliminate undesirable genetic characters. For potatoes (for example) backcrossing is not possible in some cultivars which are sterile and vegetatively propagated, so lines had to be produced on a large scale to provide a large number of genetic variants from which to select superior lines which maintained all of the quality and agronomic characteristics of the original line.
With respect to sexual hybridisation, although the vast majority of the genome must be stable between generations (to account for the observed Mendelian inheritance patterns in plants and other organisms), recent experimental work shows that gene content can be hugely different in different inbred lines of maize and wholesale deletions can occur in lines that have been developed by sexual reproduction (Fu &amp; Dooner 2002; Bennetzen et al. 2003). Although the applicability of these observations in maize to other crop plants remains to be determined, these data indicate that generalisations about the functional significance of gene order need to be approached with caution when looking at specific crops, and in some cases this may have more to do with other variables that influence the order of genes in plants (described above) rather than functionality. Although the functional significance of gene order has been established in some animal model systems as illustrated by the hox (Mann, 1997; Lufkin, 1997; Veraska, 2000) and globin (Fraser&amp; Grosveld, 1998) gene families, there is no evidence for such gene control systems in plants. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that single individual genes originally located in gene clusters are able to function properly when integrated elsewhere into separate locations in plant genomes. However, the availability of genome sequencing information (Goff et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2002) will assist research on genomic structure/function relationships for agriculturally significant species.
Genetic variation, from a wide range of sources, provides the fundamental raw material for developing superior plant varieties. The whole of plant breeding has been based on this premise, and has been remarkably successful. Breeding has succeeded in accessing genetic variation from wild or unimproved lines as well as naturally occurring and induced mutations. The breeders have then combined the best genes to produce elite new varieties. What these conventional breeding examples indicate is that it is possible to disrupt or scramble the genome in such as way as to cause random and major genomic damage and yet recover plants that are considered to have a safe history of use. Therefore, the process of breaking and joining of DNA of the host genome at many unspecified locations ‘illegitimate recombination’ and substantial scrambling of host DNA are not features unique to GM, but associated with all these breeding systems mentioned above. The breaking and rejoining of DNA and changing its juxtaposing to other regulatory sequences are tantamount to ‘position

effects’ where such rearrangements place genes in different genome environments albeit with reference to host genes rather than the cross-species gene transfers that are usually involved in GM.
Views expressed by the NGO group included the notion that natural sexual reproduction methods used in plant breeding would result in fewer major unintended effects with unpredictable consequences. They cite papers comparing the variation measured in GM and non-GM lines that have passed through tissue culture with parent material (Wang et al. (1996); Labra et al. (2001)). This evidence is welcome, but other recent experimental work shows that gene content is significantly different in different varieties of maize and large and extensive deletions can occur in varieties that have been developed by sexual reproduction. (Fu &amp; Dooner 2002; Bennetzen et al. 2003). So, the linkage between the two is not clear- cut.Marker assisted breeding (MAB) was suggested as a more generally acceptable way forward for the use of biotechnology in agriculture15. While molecular marker assisted plant breeding is a valuable breeding tool that will increase in utility in coming years, it is not a substitute for certain other plant breeding methods including genetic modification.
Gene stability
Some commentators stated that the ‘successes’ in GM crops are unstable, are prone to further changes including the silencing of foreign genes, further rearrangements of DNA and loss of genetic material, all of which is unique to the GM process. We discussed the silencing of transgenes in our first report and the need to take account of this in risk assessments. To test for structural instability, the inserted transgene would need to be monitored through successive generations. Such tests form part of the evidence that is submitted to regulatory authorities in dossiers prior to commercialisation. New varieties also have to satisfy other ‘seeds legislation’ (which applies to varieties bred by non-GM methods) to show that the material shows distinctness, uniformity and stability (DUS tests). We are unaware of any published research that has monitored transgene stability and shown that further rearrangements of DNA and loss of genetic material occurs in commercial lines. The key issue is whether this occurs more often in transgenes rather than elsewhere in the genome. Such monitoring experiments are technically feasible and could be conducted to establish whether such structural rearrangements do occur. Failure of product performance is another check on stability of the introduced trait that would be seen by farmers and notified to the seed supplier.
Prospects for identifying unintended harmful effects before commercialisation
Some commentators stated that because of the unique features associated with genetic transformation (as well as the chromosomal and point mutations associated with the tissue culture steps that accompany transformation processes), the sum total of unintended effects might not be seen until the crop was approved and grown for a number of years.

Plant selection and regulation
In coming to a judgement on whether GM poses a greater likelihood of adverse unintended effects, it is important to realise that, although a population of transgenic plants generated using a gene cassette can show a unanticipated and unexpected effects, it is from this primary population that plant breeders select individual plants for further analysis. Breeders do not simply select a primary transformant and place it on the market. On the way to commercialisation, plants are selected using molecular genetic, biochemical, and agronomic criteria favouring plants that are stable, predictable and do not cause adverse effects. So from a variable starting point, lines that are stable and predictable are selected.
A related criticism from some commentators was that the use of agronomic criteria to assess GM, as presented in Chapter 4 of our First Report, continued to hold to the now outmoded view that genes are isolated units of information, which as a result can be moved between organisms with totally predictable outcomes; and that the report was predicated on the reductionism view of the science of genetics, and the role that this theory states that DNA plays16 17. It was stated: ‘in genetic engineering it is assumed, without adequate experimental proof, that a bacterial gene for an insecticide protein, for example, transferred to a maize plant, will produce precisely that protein and nothing else. Yet in the alien genetic environment, alternative splicing of the bacterial gene might give variants of the intended protein, or even proteins bearing little structural relationship to the original one, with unpredictable effects on ecosystems and human health’. This statement misrepresents the current thinking and practices amongst the plant sciences, plant breeders and the regulatory community. First, a century of scientific plant breeding and plant genetics research has established that genes interact with one another and with the environment. This is widely recognised. This is why all plant breeding involves several years of evaluation under different environments and in different genetic backgrounds. Interactions between genes, and between genes and the environment have been studied since the birth of genetics and are detailed in the earliest genetics textbooks. More recent advances in molecular genetics are now explaining the sources of genetic variation that plant breeders have worked with successfully for almost a century. Second, and specific to GM plant breeding; the regulatory framework does not assume that what is used in a gene manipulation experiment is what is actually inserted. The legislation recognises that genes can be disrupted so that coding sequences can come under the influence of host promoters or transgene promoters can activate host genes. Applicants are required to submit detailed dossiers that characterise the structure of the DNA actually inserted. Therefore, safety assessments made on GM crops are not only based on agronomic criteria but molecular characterisation forms an essential part of the process of risk assessment.
Risk management
One commentator stated ‘Much of the risk arising from random genetic mutations and other procedures is removed by backcrossing. In comparison, some GM crops varieties released commercially appear to have never been backcrossed. These include all transgenic varieties of potato and papaya.’

Sexually compatible (seed producing) transgenic crops are almost invariably backcrossed because the inheritance pattern is valuable information in assessing a breeding line and is often required in risk assessment. Plant breeders also very frequently need to backcross a transgenic plant into locally adapted and new elite crop varieties. To breed a crop for a particular agricultural purpose it is important to test for many characters (disease resistance, pest resistance, flavour, cooking quality, earliness, height). The transgenic crop character is usually only one of many characters that breeders must evaluate and combine. In the case of vegetatively propagated crops such as potatoes, it can be still be possible to backcross. But if breeders do not wish to backcross they would normally make many transgenic lines and select the ones with superior characters after a range of field and quality tests are applied. This is the same procedure for mutation breeding in vegetative propagated crops where backcrossing may not be feasible or desirable. We agree that such backcross approaches may be helpful and that where this is not available, selection from a wider range of primary transgenic plants to find those with desired characteristics may compensate for this. However, of greater importance is the need to accurately characterise the inserted genetic material as a basis to develop sound risk assessments. This is discussed in detail in an ACRE publication18.
This raises a wider issue of risk management and the intelligent design of GM plants that minimise the opportunities for unintended adverse effects. For example, targeting transgene insertions (First Report, Section 4.7, paragraph 1) is one future development that addresses some of the major concerns arising from the random integration events. This is an emerging area of research and is discussed in an ACRE publication19. Other advances highlighted in our First Report (Section 4.8) are molecular (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) and metabolic (metabonomics) profiling as well as the role of epigenetic states (DNA methylation patterns and the histone code). This should provide insight into basic biological processes and the effects of genetic alterations through GM and other procedures.
4.3 CHAPTER 5: THE SAFETY OF FOOD AND ANIMAL FEED DERIVED FROM GM CROPS
4.3.1 Possible nutritional and toxicological differences in GM food Summary conclusions from First Report
‘All novel food in the UK, which includes food produced by GM organisms, is subject to an EU-based and internationally determined regulatory regime, with procedures for safety assessment and risk analysis. The regime recognises that the consumption of food is not risk- free and requires any novel (including GM) food to be at least as safe and nutritious as any traditional food it replaces or complements.
To date world-wide there have been no verifiable untoward toxic or nutritionally deleterious effects resulting from the cultivation and consumption of products from GM crops. However, absence of readily observable adverse effects does not mean that these can be completely ruled out and there has been no epidemiological monitoring of those consuming GM food. Some people reason that the absence of evidence of harm should not be treated as evidence of

   46

the absence of harm. This argues for greater reliance on scientific research and epidemiological monitoring. Other people reason that the combination of testing by developers to demonstrate safety equivalence to commercial crops in order to satisfy regulatory requirements for clearance and extensive use around the world over long time periods and large exposed populations and absence of evidence of harm, does provide important experience of safety. The long-term assessment of the health effects for whole foods and feeds is considerably more difficult than the post-marketing monitoring and surveillance of a simple substance such as a single medicine. Countries are working to develop post-marketing surveillance to detect potential human health effects of food in general, but at present there is nothing yet available specifically for GM foods in any country.
Safety assessment technologies such as screening and profiling techniques will need to continue to evolve, incorporating data on all possible entry-points for new hazards and to cope with uncertainties and gaps in knowledge. The complexity of the safety assessment process is likely to increase with the development of ‘second generation’ GM crops. These crops and their products aim to: decrease levels of anti-nutritional factors (e.g. toxins and allergens); increase levels of health promoting factors (e.g. antioxidants); and modify levels of macro or micronutrients (e.g. proteins, lipids and vitamins).’
The adequacy of safety assessment: best practice and reality
Main points made by commentators
One group of commentators20 stated that our First Report gave an over-optimistic picture of the safety of GM foods in the food chain by focusing on best practice, or what is theoretically possible, in GM food safety assessment rather than what is actually done, which they stated was inadequate. They cited a study of EU GM product dossiers by Spok et al. (2002) in evidence. Another commentator21 stated that we should have given more references to specific papers on safety testing rather than quoting the review by Kuiper et al. (2001), which only mentions 10 refereed publications.
A common concern amongst commentators was the adequacy of safety evaluation information, such as nutritional and toxicological studies and feeding studies in general. It was repeatedly stated that these needed to be of higher quality, peer-reviewed, and more publicly accessible20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29. References were made to reports by the Royal Society, in relation to the possible toxicity of GM potatoes30 and the Scottish Parliament’s Health Committee enquiry31 in support of the need for adequate safety evaluation information. It was also indicated by some that there was a need for feeding trials on human

volunteers, as the results of tests on animals could not necessarily be extrapolated to other species32 33 34 35.
The Panel’s response
Chapter 3 of our First Report considered ‘Science in the Regulatory Process’. There are also frequent references to the regulatory approach and safety assessment in Chapter 5 on ‘GM Derived Food and Animal Feed Safety’. We do acknowledge on page 65 that ‘if the new gene product or endogenous plant metabolites were not as intended they could potentially lead to toxic, allergic or antinutritional effects’. And we go on to discuss that this is no different in extent than for other novel foods or indeed new varieties of plants including variation from various sources. We further state on page 71 that ‘The sufficiency and robustness of testing protocols is sometimes the subject of scientific contention. But they are widely accepted as the best presently available, whilst recognising that they will be reviewed and improved, for example in light of technological developments’. The comments in our First Report considered current evidence and what is scientifically achievable today, recognizing areas of uncertainty, and not some hypothetical or theoretical ideal. We also considered future developments (e.g. expression profiling in Section 5.2.3, page 69).
We welcome the identification of the Austrian report, which criticizes the adequacy of the information relating to toxicity, allergenicity and substantial equivalence in 11 EU GM application dossiers (which complied with the regulations which existed at the time of their scientific review). The European Commission Guidance Document for ‘The risk assessment of genetically modified plants and derived foods and feed’, issued in March 2003 and cited in our First Report (EC, 2003), provides guidance to notifiers and risk assessors on the preparation and information needed for regulatory dossiers. It notes that while ‘It is not the purpose of this guidance document to prescribe specific protocols for the execution of experiments...Data provided in support of an application should be of at least the quality expected of data submitted to a high-ranking peer-review journal. Particular attention should be paid to the sensitivity and specificity of methods employed and to the adequacy and appropriateness of the controls’. Industry has itself issued guidance on a range of technical information required for scientific assessments.36
Science can underpin advice on robust and achievable regulatory mechanisms. However, the enforcement and consistent application of the regulatory framework and what constitutes an acceptable regulatory burden are outside the scope of our Review. As we say in our First Report, science provides the evidence base for decisions on safety to human health and the environment. But it is not the basis for how effectively (scientifically achievable) regulatory requirements are enforced. If there is an identifiable deficiency in scientifically achievable aspects of a regulatory system, then it is for regulatory bodies and Government to consider the implications for health and safety. More evidence, through further research on the extent to which regulatory practice does actually comply with aims and aspirations, would be desirable.
In this regard, we should clarify that certain provisions referred to elsewhere in our First Report, such as the composition testing of entire foods (page 65) or the practice of sub- chronic 90 day rat feeding studies (page 69) are only routinely applied in a proportion of

  48

cases. For example, 90 day studies are not always conducted for reasons of palatability or dietary balance. Such studies are typical but not mandatory and a case-by-case approach is applied. We welcome this opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings that might unwittingly have occurred concerning the scope and extent of existing regulatory provisions as routinely implemented in practice.
As we said on page 43 of our First Report, any regulatory system is dynamic, continuous (i.e. always under review to take account of advances in science and technology and prevailing knowledge), subject to critical challenge and continuously subject to improvement. Any regulatory system will in practice be less than 100% perfect. It is important not to exaggerate the efficacy or completeness of regulatory appraisal but also to take all reasonable opportunities to ensure that actual practice makes full use of feasible and appropriate techniques. If applied as intended, the approval system for GM foods is certainly no worse, and in this respect more detailed, than that for conventional novel foods. We explained on pages 68 and 69 of our First Report, in relation to the evaluation of toxicity and allergenicity, how the nature of the substance determines the testing methodology. For instance, pharmaceuticals are chemically well-defined substances used in relatively small amounts which enables a somewhat different approach to be applied compared to that for GM foods.
Regulatory dossiers, drawn up for the Competent Authority for different GM products, by different notifiers, at different times, will by definition vary in style, format and content. A wide range of bioinformatic, in vitro, in vivo, in planta and field trials work is contained within these dossiers and it is unusual for this all to be published. Often the work is 'new product' development as opposed to basic research and as such does not add significantly to the science base. As such it is less suited as well as less attractive for publication in peer reviewed scientific literature. In many cases relatively standard protocols are used and the work is performed to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), possibly with some of it contracted out. While a number of individual studies have been published by various authors this is not done routinely,which accounts for a relative shortageof such work in the peer reviewed literature. The same is true for pharmaceutical (as well as pesticide) registrations. Apart from the pharmacology and mode of action, which may be novel, there is insufficient material of original interest. However, detailed summaries will be provided within the new European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) system. Some companies publish detailed summaries on their company websites. This being said, several hundred studies designed to demonstrate toxicological, antinutritional, growth performance, mode of action, bioavailability or allergy potential have been reported quite widely over the last few years. Other studies have been reported in associated safety areas, such as: viral DNA; DNA/protein absence from milk meat and eggs; assessment of animal models; antibiotic resistance markers (ARMs); compositional analysis; and the overall safety assessment procedure. All of this information is considered holistically in the process of safety evaluation described in our First Report.
Low-level human health effects and long term monitoring
Main points made by commentators
Several commentators37 38 39 highlighted statements on pages 10 and 73 of our First Report, indicating a lack of substantiated adverse human health effects from the extensive cultivation

and consumption of GM foods over the last seven years, as not proving GM foods are safe. Some commentators called for more research leading to the introduction of systematic long- term health monitoring40 41 42 43 44 45, whilst others acknowledged the difficulty of linking cause with low-level human health effect46 47 48. Two commentators made a link between the consumption of GM food and what they saw as an increase in food-borne illnesses in the US (Mead et al. 1999)40 49.
The Panel’s response
We addressed this issue in Section 5.2 of our First Report (pages 62 and 73). And on page 10 we indicated that the long-term assessment of health effects for whole foods or feeds, containing thousands of individual macro and micro-nutrients as well as other substances, is considerably more difficult than the post-marketing surveillance of a single substance such as a new pharmaceutical active ingredient. We also stated on page 7350 that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) had commissioned further research in this area. The results of this research were published during the summer of 200351.
The argument is put that ‘absence of evidence of harm is not evidence of absence of harm’. In essence this is correct, over the timescale of testing conventionally-bred novel crops of any origin, or indeed for any human activity. In our First Report, we did not claim that GM foods were absolutely safe. However, in the longer term, if all the available evidence fails to indicate that adverse effects have occurred, then we become more confident that harm is unlikely and our risk-benefit analysis changes. Most traditional foods have never been tested for safety because extended safe use does ultimately provide reassurance of safety. (Also see Section 4.4.8 on the statistical aspects of environmental monitoring.)
The current view of post-marketing surveillance methodology indicates that if the effect is immediate and severe then it probably is possible to establish a causal link between a new food or food ingredient and the effect. If it is not severe and only manifests itself in the longer term, it may be possible retrospectively to identify a specific food or feed as a causal factor. However, it is difficult to prove a causal link between a food substance and some as yet unspecified long-term or minor effect with a background of changing diets and lifestyles. This is due to the following factors that would confound any attempt to establish such a link and make it difficult to design a rigorously controlled experiment:
(1) Data would be required about the food consumption by individuals over a long period, and a broader range of risk factors. Any survey would need to include food bought and consumed outside the household (currently more than 30% and likely to rise to 50%

over the next 20 years). There will often be strong correlations between products not obviously related (e.g. a particular brand of nappy with a particular food brand because the same shops stock both, or a particular bottled water with an activity because of advertising, although any could cause later illness). Household surveys do not distinguish which person in the household consumes how much of each of the components of the weekly shopping basket.
(2) The exact composition of each product, many with multiple ingredients, would be required to be known. Manufacturers are reluctant to provide precise details of product ingredients, which are often a trade secret. It would be difficult to track ingredient changes. This is essential information for post-market surveillance in identifying the causative agent and establishing any dose-response relationship.
(3) Systematic linking of causality to a particular food intake retrospectively after 10 or even 40 years, on a background of changing food consumption patterns and lifestyles, would need enormous sample sizes and complex databases.
(4) The need for a relational database to connect health records to food consumed raises issues of patient confidentiality and informed consent.
Difficulties in demonstrating the validity of claims linking food to health effects are widely known and the subject of much regulatory discussion with respect to labelling and legal liability. Despite these considerable difficulties, as we said in our First Report (pages 73 and 77), there are ongoing epidemiological studies, and international interest in the feasibility of implementing some form of post-marketing surveillance of potential human food-related late health effects.
The study by Mead et al. (1999) on ‘Food-related illness and death in the United States’ involved the compilation and analysis of information from multiple surveillance systems and other sources. The commentators who quoted this source said that the study had ‘found that between 1994, when GM food was first introduced, and 1999, foodborne illnesses in the United States have increased two to ten-fold’. This is an incorrect interpretation of the report’s findings. Nowhere in the report was GM food or feed associated with changes in foodborne illness. Estimates of the overall rate of death from foodborne illness were found to be lower than those estimated for 1994, and the overall incidence of illness was within the range estimated in 1985. Estimates of overall disease were greater (by a factor of about 2) since the 1994 estimate but this was almost entirely accounted for by a different method used to estimate the impact of the Norwalk Virus. The authors concluded that:
‘Methodologic differences between our analysis and previously published studies make it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding overall trends in the incidence of foodborne illness. In general, the differences between our estimates and previously published figures appear to be due primarily to the availability of better information and new analyses rather than real changes in disease frequency over time.’
51

Toxicity testing
Main points made by commentators
A number of commentators stated that we had swept aside or misrepresented evidence of harm from GM food crops, particularly on toxicity and the work of Dr Pusztai and co- workers52 53 54 55. These studies involved the administration to rats of various diets, some containing potatoes (both raw and cooked), either with or without the addition of non-potato lectin (from the snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) or the jack bean (concanavalin A), used as a positive control) or potatoes which had been genetically modified to produce the snowdrop lectin. Adverse effects were reported on the rats’ growth and their immune function (Ewen &amp; Pusztai, 1999). The most extensive comments on both the interpretation of these data and this issue came from Dr Pusztai himself and from Professor Burke54 56. One commentator stated that we could have given more references to acute toxicity testing in animal models54. Another referred to recently published work by Chen et al., which found no significant difference between rats and mice fed on GM and non-GM diets57. Yet another gave an incomplete reference to a study that appears to support Dr Pusztai’s findings58.
The Panel’s response
Dr Pusztai’s work was mentioned in Section 5.2 of our First Report (page 66), which considered ‘Possible Nutritional and Toxicological Differences in GM food’, where we acknowledged that there are different opinions over whether GM foods present a problem for human health. We considered this in the subsequent sections of this chapter. Several commentators on the First Report also referred to a recent review of the potential human health effects of GM foods (Pusztai et al. 2003).
Since these studies first came to the attention of the media in 1998, they have been the subject of considerable scientific scrutiny. The data have been examined by an independent audit committee chaired by Professor John Bourne, the Royal Society (1999), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) and the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT). Fundamental flaws were found in the experimental design, its execution and the analysis of, and conclusions from, the data.
ACNFP and COT studied the work in great detail and concluded that the rat diet did not have appropriate nutritional adequacy or nutrient density and that consumption of raw non-GM potato starch has been shown to produce alterations to rat gut morphology. ACNFP noted that ‘many of the adverse effects seen occurred in rats fed potatoes spiked with high levels of the con[canavalin] A lectin’. Finally the reliability of the lymphocyte proliferation assay used was called into question. Both Committees considered that no reliable conclusions could be reached (ACNFP 2000). Subsequent repetition of this and similar studies, performed more rigorously and systematically, have not confirmed the conclusions of Dr Pusztai and his colleagues. (See for example Chen et al. (2003) on the safety assessment for GM sweet

See also Sections 4.3.3 and 4.5.4.
Insecticidal endotoxins
Main points made by commentators
Two commentators59 60 highlighted the possible dangers of including insecticidal endotoxins, particularly Bt, in our diet and stated that our Report had either misrepresented or not highlighted this sufficiently (Pusztai et al. 2003).
The Panel’s response
In response to these comments we provide the following review of the literature related to Bt proteins (Cry proteins) with insecticidal or other effects.
In susceptible insects (e.g. lepidoptera), the toxicity of a particular Bt protein is correlated with the number of high-affinity binding sites on the microvilli of gut epithelial cells (English &amp; Slatin, 1992; Schnepf et al. 1998; Ballester et al. 1999; Van Mellaert et al. 1999). The lack of toxicity of Cry proteins to non-target invertebrate species (IPCS, 1999) is due to the absence of high-affinity Cry protein binding receptors on gut epithelial cells (Ballester et al. 1999). Several studies with vertebrate species (mice, rats, monkeys, humans) have also failed to find high affinity Cry protein binding sites on gut epithelial cell membranes (Noteborn et al. 1993; Noteborn et al. 1995; Hofmann et al. 1998). This is the basis of the selectivity of Cry proteins. They are acutely toxic to susceptible insects with high-affinity binding sites (LD50’s of approximately a few μg/kg body weight), but are non-toxic to vertebrate species even when dosed at greater than 1 g/kg body weight (EPA, 1998; McClintock et al. 1995).
Other considerations that support the dietary safety of Cry proteins for humans and animals are: (English &amp; Slatin, 1992) the acidic environment of the mammalian stomach that does not favour dissolution and activation of the Cry proteins (susceptible insects have alkaline gastrointestinal tracts); (Schnepf et al. 1998) the rapid degradation of the Cry proteins by pepsin in the stomach and (Ballester et al. 1999) the lack of high-affinity Cry-specific binding receptors on mammalian gut epithelial cells. There are no reports of microscopic changes in the gastrointestinal tract of rodents administered very high, acute dosages of microbial Bt pesticide formulations by the enteral route (McClintock et al. 1995). There was also no evidence of toxicity in sub-chronic and chronic feeding studies where Bt microbial formulations were administered at dosages up to 8400 mg/kg/day (McClintock et al. 1995).
Findings from these studies on exogenously applied (e.g. organically sprayed) Bt are relevant to the safety assessment of GM Bt-protected plants because the microbial preparations contain the same classes of Cry proteins (Cry1, Cry2 and Cry3) introduced into GM food and feed crops (Betz et al. 2000). More recently, rats have been fed grain from Bt corn over 13 weeks at dietary levels far higher than human exposure levels and showed no macroscopic or microscopic changes in gastrointestinal tract tissues (Dudek et al. 2002). Moreover, there was little evidence of toxicity during incubation of mammalian cells in vitro with Cry proteins (Shimada et al. 2003; Thomas &amp; Ellar 1983).

There are reports in the literature of binding of Cry proteins to mammalian gastrointestinal cells in vitro, changes in the ileum of mice dosed with a Bt microbial formulation (unspecified strain) and immunogenicity of Cry1Ac protein given by parenteral or enteral administration (Fares et al. 1998; Vazquez-Padron et al. 1999; Vazquez-Padron et al. 2000; Pusztai et al. 2003). The relevance of these studies to human safety assessment of Cry proteins have been questioned due to deficiencies in the studies and the use of dosing techniques that bypass the protective role of the stomach in breaking down ingested proteins (Siegel, 2001; Federici, 2002). The weight of evidence of the many safety studies that have been completed indicates that the use of Cry proteins to protect conventional organic or GM crops against insect damage poses no meaningful food safety risks to humans. The highly selective mode of action of these insect control proteins forms the basis of their history of safe use in conventional and organic agriculture for over 40 years (IPCS, 1999; EPA, 1998; McClintock et al. 1995; Betz et al. 2000; Siegel, 2001; Federici, 2002).
GM foods and developing countries
Main points made by commentators
Some commentators61 62 stated that it was a misconception to suggest that GM foods would provide a solution to malnutrition in developing countries when its causes were largely social and economic. Several commentators62 63 64 65 stated that Golden Rice was a poor example to quote as a nutritionally enhanced GM food, when it would be necessary to eat some 9kg to obtain the daily Vitamin A requirement.
The Panel’s response
In our First Report (page 8) we said that our Review focused on the potential use of GM crops in the UK, although issues about the use of GM crops elsewhere, particularly in developing countries, were raised and discussed and we hoped that our work might be of use in other countries in clarifying issues and generally informing debate.
We discussed the development of safer, nutritionally enhanced foods in Section 5.2.7 of our First Report. At the end of this Section we noted that nearly one sixth of the global population of some six billion people do not have adequate diets and that micronutrient deficiencies are common. We illustrated some ways (such as Golden Rice) in which GM technology was being used to enhance nutrient quality. In doing this we simply wished to illustrate a line of future development, which might be of particular benefit to developing countries. Whatever the significance of developments in GM food for developing countries, we acknowledge that science can only play a part in the complex issue of how worldwide malnutrition might be addressed. A general discussion of this is well beyond the scope of our Review.
The international impact of UK developments in GM food and crops were considered in the Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit study into the costs and benefits associated with growing GM

crops66. The implications of GM crops for the developing world have also been considered in reports by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics67.
4.3.2 Food allergies from GM crops Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Changes in allergenicity during the breeding of conventional crops are not assessed in a regulatory framework and are not formally evaluated.
GM technology enables a particular gene construct for a new protein to be introduced, and the potential allergenic effect of that protein is a focal point for safety assessment. In addition, the regulatory process, with its case-by-case approach, must take account of possibly increasing exposure to a GM protein, especially if it is expressed in a diversity of different GM plants, and thus introduced into a diverse range of foodstuffs. In the hypothetical case, where a potential GM allergen was not recognised in regulatory screening, and its effects only emerged in the longer term, avoidance of the allergenic protein by the consumer could be difficult, because they would not be able to recognise its presence in the foodstuffs. The likelihood of this scenario is very low for a number of reasons. However, avoidance in a GM or non-GM case would depend on the relative effectiveness of labelling, traceability and recall systems and it would be for the regulatory system to ensure that any GM allergen once known, with a potentially significant effect on any consumer, should be labelled in a fail-safe way or withdrawn from the marketplace.
It is probably easier to evaluate the risk of introducing allergenic proteins and altering the allergenic composition of the target crops after use of GM than with some conventional breeding techniques.
There is an accepted approach, based on a standard set of safety tests, to the assessment of the allergic potential. But there is some contention over the value of specific tests and if, and how they can be improved. These tests are under continuous evaluation and improvements are considered in the scientific and regulatory literature.
The GM foods consumed at present (by large numbers of people for up to seven years) do not appear to have elicited allergic reactions. Arguments for and against the significance of this are the same as for nutritional and toxicological effects (see 5.2 above). Our relative lack of knowledge about factors that are important in sensitisation and the elicitation of an allergic response suggest that we should continue to exercise caution when assessing all new foods, including foods and animal feeds derived from GM crops.’

The allergenicity testing methodology
Main points made by commentators
Several contributors raised concerns about the adequacy of current or proposed testing methodologies for allergencicity in GM crops.68 69 70 (Germolec et al. 2003; Kleter &amp; Peijnenburg, 2002; Jank &amp; Haslberger, 2003; Bernstein et al. 2003). One group of contributors stated that we had falsely implied in our Report that the regulatory process would always detect novel allergens in GM foods71, whilst others72 73 stated that, if anything, there was less of a risk of undetected allergens in GM compared to conventionally bred plants.
The Panel’s response
In our First Report we concluded that no regulatory process will always detect novel allergens in GM foods. In Section 5.3 we considered food allergies from GM crops and on page 89 we state that ‘Absolute certainty about lack of allergenicity cannot be achieved (EC, 2003) in this or any other risk assessment’. Individual people vary considerably in their sensitivity to different protein food allergens; the acceptable proportion of people that are adversely affected is a political judgment. The genetically determined hypersensitivity to certain allergens (atopy) can also appear and disappear in the same individual at different stages of their life. This section of the First Report makes a strong point in acknowledging our relative lack of knowledge about aspects of allergenicity and the limitations of current safety assessment procedures for any novel food.
In Section 5.3.4 of our First Report (page 89) we state: ‘The main area of contention appears to be the value of specific tests and if, and how, they can be improved’. Similarly, at a conference on the Assessment of the Allergenic Potential of Genetically Modified Foods in the USA in 200174, it was stated that: ‘Potential benefits that may be derived from biotechnologies involving genetically modified organisms could be enormous. Potential risks of allergenicity possibly associated with their use will likely be manageable, provided appropriate information is available to decision makers’ (Selgrade et al. 2003). This last sentence embodies the issue under discussion. To recapitulate, four different types of test regimes have been proposed in decision making that aim to structure the assessment scientifically.
Computer evaluation of sequence similarity
The issue of requiring six (increases chance of false positives) or eight (increases chance of false negatives) or 35% (28) out of 80 amino acids75 is a judgement which must be made by regulatory committees. And the suggestion by Kleter &amp; Peijnenburg (2002) to include an analysis of surface availability of the epitopes is an additional consideration. Although, as we reported on page 82, conformational epitopes will be destroyed and new linear epitopes may be unmasked by food processing, or by denaturation of the protein by stomach acid, or by degradation of protein in the digestive process. The potential shortcomings of this technology have been outlined on page 87 of our First Report and need no repetition.

Resistance to proteolytic digestion
We indicated on page 83 that there is no universal correlation between stability in gastric fluid and allergenic potential.
Serum screens
This area of evaluation is hampered by a lack of availability of sera and more effort should be made to collect these. However in principle, the clinical testing involved in protecting the susceptible human population (about 1 in 50 people) potentially provides a good way forward. Genetic variation in the human population will make prediction of individual allergic responses impossible at present.
Collections of sera will need to be built up and as well as collections of standardised known allergens and non-allergens as positive and negative controls in tests. Testing of those who have occupational exposure to allergens has been proposed. This could be helpful and this area has been little studied, yet could be of public health significance (Bernstein et al. 2003).
Animal tests
There is strong support for the development of better animal tests that would allow a dose response measure to be derived for allergens (Selgrade et al. 2003). This might allow quantification of relative sensitising dose of the potential allergens as well as quantification of responses. There are no theoretical impediments to develop the appropriate tests for identified potential allergens similar to that relied upon in toxicity testing for human and animal medicines. Tests for the allergenicity of whole foods are more difficult as in most cases it would be impossible to feed animals the required amounts of GM containing food without seriously distorting their normal diet and hence inducing pathogenic effects.
Studies from the 2001 conference mentioned on the previous page and those of expert groups in the EU (EC, 2003) come to similar conclusions as our First Report. They support suggestions for future research elaborated in Section 5.3.8 (page 89) of our First Report. Apart from basic research in allergic responses in humans, a number of areas of research aiming at hazard identification were proposed in the paper by Selgrade et al. (2003). These were:
• development evaluation and validation of animal models;
• establishment of serum banks;
• improved human skin test technology;
• identification and banking of known allergens and non-allergens;
• a systematic approach to recording adverse events (case studies);
• development of relative potency, and thresholds for sensitisation and elicitation of the allergic reaction; and
• development and refinement, standardisation of tests protocols.
   57

None of these issues are GM specific as all apply to other novel foods and conventional breeding methods. GM technology may have highlighted the need for improved assessment but is actually more able to deal with the issues since comparability with parent crops is more straightforward because exact gene and protein sequences are known. An influence on the variation in the composition of food stuffs and crops comes from agronomic practices, the weather, the soil type, the plant variety etc. In fact, comparisons between parent plants and GM derivatives grown under similar conditions allow this type of comparison to be put on a more solid scientific basis opening up the potential for application of proteome, metabolome and transcriptome analysis to deal with potential issues such as unintended effects.
The allergenicity of GM pollen
Main points made by commentators
Two commentators76 77 were specifically concerned about the lack of research into the potential allergenicity of GM pollen.
The Panel’s response
In our First Report we mentioned the need to test for the allergenicity of ingested or inhaled pollen, for any new means of food production (page 61). Exposure routes, other than ingestion, were also mentioned on page 102, where we referred to the Royal Society report (Royal Society, 2002), which emphasised the importance of including all exposure routes in any risk analysis of the allergenic potential of GM (and other) plants. In Section 5.3.8 of our First Report we said that ‘The factors that are important in sensitisation and eliciting an allergic response are not well understood and more research is necessary into the causes of food allergy and the mechanisms by which persons are sensitised and by which the responses are elicited.’ This applies as much to GM and non-GM pollen as it does to GM and non-GM foods.
4.3.3 The fate of transgenic DNA Summary conclusions from First Report
‘The food we consume from conventionally bred crops contains large quantities of DNA, since DNA is a universal component of all living organisms and is not typically removed by the extraction and processing technologies used by the food and drinks industry. Some processes, such as sugar purification and the production of refined oils, remove most, sometimes all, of the DNA from a product before it is consumed. Other processes, such as heat treatment, whilst not removing DNA entirely, cause extensive inactivation and breakdown. The consumption of raw vegetables and fruits does, of course, mean that intact DNA is ingested.
DNA, like other large molecules in food, is very largely degraded (broken down to smaller molecules) in the gut, but this process of structural degradation whilst inactivating the DNA’s genetic information, is not 100% efficient. Fragments of ingested DNA have been found throughout the digestive system and elsewhere in the body, including the blood stream. Our

guts contain very large numbers of bacteria, which help us to digest the food we consume. Whilst it is possible that these bacteria take up DNA from their environment (i.e. our digestive systems and the foods they contain) there is a series of well-established barriers in place to prevent the genomic integration and expression of foreign genes. This process is unlikely to be of biological significance unless: (1) the bacterial cells can use at least some of the genetic information that the DNA encodes; and (2) that information confers a selective advantage, leading to an increase in the proportion of the bacteria that contain this new DNA.
In GM food, the introduced DNA will have the same fate as DNA present in conventional food and will be inactivated and increasingly degraded as the food progresses through the digestive system. If the food originates from a GM crop in which bacterial DNA is part of the transgene, then, whilst still likely to be a rare occurrence, there is increased opportunity for that DNA to transfer into gut bacteria. This possibility makes it essential, in the achievement of maximum risk reduction, for the regulatory process to consider each GM crop as an individual entity with its own potential risks.
Antibiotic resistance is not only widespread as a consequence of antibiotic and feed additive usage and over prescription and non-compliance in medical use, but because it is highly selected for in microbes in the wild. Bacterial genes conferring antibiotic resistance have been a commonly used tool for selection in GM technology, but alternatives have now been developed and it is possible to eliminate antibiotic resistance gene markers following GM plant construction. So, the presence of antibiotic resistance genes can now be avoided in GM plants intended for food use. The use of antibiotic resistance genes in plants remains controversial, with differing views on its potential impact. There is a scientifically well- supported argument that any rare resistance gene transfer event from a GM plant or food would have no impact as antibiotic resistance is already widespread as a consequence of antibiotic usage in medicine and animal feed.’
The distictiveness of transgenic DNA
Main points made by commentators
Several commentators78 79 80 81 questioned our analysis that ‘transgenic DNA is no different from other DNA consumed as part of the normal diet and it will have a similar fate’ (page 90 of our First Report). Some stated that it clearly was different, because it contained a novel combination of genetic material from different species and genetic material often designed to enhance horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and recombination. One commentator82 agreed with our assessment, and one83 stated that we had misleadingly implied that there was an increased opportunity for bacterial DNA present in a GM crop to transfer to gut bacteria per se.
The Panel’s response
We accept that the molecular configuration of transgenic DNA can be different from other DNA. The short statement on page 90 of our First Report would have been more accurate if it had read ‘Transgenic DNA is no different from other DNA in its behavior when consumed as

 59

part of the normal diet and it will have a similar fate’. We still support the conclusion in our First Report that there is no evidence that transgenic DNA per se behaves differently from any other DNA with respect to its fate following consumption in food, whilst also recognizing the need for more research in areas such as gene transfer in the gastro-intestinal tract (see below).
The evidence for horizontal gene transfer in the GI-tract
Main points made by commentators
It was stated by one group of commentators that there had been insufficient research in this area (i.e. little was known about HGT within the GI-tract of humans and animals) and that we had downplayed the risks and uncertainties in assessing the present state of knowledge84. It was stated by several commentators that more research was needed on the variation in the behaviour of the human GI-tract between individuals84 85 86 (e.g. susceptibility to gut disorders and those with an unhealthy GI-tract).
It was stated by two commentators85 87 that, despite limited research (Breibart et al. 2003; Toivanen et al. 2001) there was positive evidence for HGT in food and in the GI-tract that we had ignored or dismissed (Netherwood, et al. 2002; Bauer et al. 1999). Some commentators85 87 88 89 placed great importance on evidence for the survival of transgenic DNA in the GI-tract or the body, in some cases even equating this to evidence of HGT (Chowdhury et al. 2003).
The Panel’s response
Our First Report included a detailed review of gene transfer potential in the human or animal GI tract and in the environment. We were clear that a series of studies demonstrated that consumed DNA is degraded during passage through the GI tract but that the process is incomplete, especially in the more proximal regions. The retention of biological activity and potential to transform bacteria was also discussed. Experimental studies of gene transfer from GM plants to naturally transformable bacteria clearly identified marker rescue as the most likely molecular mechanism. This prompted a conclusion that in GM plants, the restriction of homology to bacterial DNA was to be recommended, making it desirable to minimise bacterial sequences within the transgenic DNA. The existence of bacterial transformation in the environment was highlighted, as were the limitations to gene transfer imposed by the molecular aspects of transformation processes as we understand them.
The study of human ileostomists by Netherwood, et al. (2002) was discussed in some detail in our First Report (pages 92 and 96). This investigation used a PCR amplification approach to follow the fate of transgenic DNA after the consumption of meals based on GM soya. Transgenic DNA was detected in samples taken from the gastro-intestinal tract indicating that degradation was incomplete. An in vitro bacterial culture of this material was established and a positive PCR result was observed through several sub-cultures suggesting that the DNA target was being replicated. This has been taken as evidence for gene transfer taking place in

the human gastro-intestinal tract. Our First Report recognised that this result was unexpected and warranted further investigation. However, it was pointed out that this observation was not a rigorous demonstration of gene transfer and might be explained by other interpretations (First Report, page 96). The existence of gastro-intestinal tract microbes that cannot be cultured is well known but in this case the positive PCR data have been interpreted to suggest that in vitro culture of a transformed bacterial species was achieved. However, the fact that a pure culture was not obtained and subjected to molecular characterisation remains significant.
As we mentioned on pages 98 and 99 of our First Report there is a need for more research into gene transfer in the gastro-intestinal tract, both in vivo and via appropriate models. More human studies would be valuable, although there are practical difficulties. Follow-up of the Netherwood study is desirable, to replicate and explain the positive PCR data and hence clarify their significance.
The significance of ‘recombination hotspots’
Main points made by commentators
Two commentators90 91 stated that ‘many GM DNAs possess ‘recombination hotspots’ making them extra-unstable, and hence more prone to horizontal gene transfer and recombination, with all the attendant risks’ and that we had suppressed this evidence. The CaMV 35S promoter (Ca MV p35S) was regarded as the prime offender by these, and one other group of, commentators92.
The Panel’s response
Evidence for the alleged existence of a recombination hotspot in the cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV 35S promoter was considered quite fully in our First Report (Section 5.2.3, page 70 and Section 7.5.3, pp. 244-5). We concluded that there was no biologically plausible mechanism or evidence for the consumption of the CaMV p35S leading to any adverse health effect. Small regions of DNA homology are likely to be found in many different DNA sequences and they may provide a mechanism for rare integration events.
Other components of GM DNA were cited as recombination hot spots but in these cases other phenomena that may or may not be relevant to enhanced gene transfer are involved. With respect to the borders of integrating plasmids, the mechanism of Agrobacterium T-DNA integration is controlled by genetic components of the bacterial vector system and these do not remain in the GM plant. Restriction endonuclease sites present on DNA polylinkers are dependent on specific restriction endonucleases for functionality, which are unlikely to be present in a GM plant. Also, these sequences are very widely distributed throughout all DNA. The presence of a bacterial plasmid origin of replication would provide a means of DNA maintenance should DNA be taken up by bacterial species able to support it. Plasmid replicons have restricted host ranges and this specificity limits impact on gene transfer potential. Importantly, our understanding of molecular mechanisms in bacterial transformation and experimental data on plant to bacterium gene transfer suggest that marker rescue is the most feasible mechanism and this restricts the relevance of plasmid replicons. Origins of transfer are bacterium-specific and would only be of relevance subsequent to a

primary plant to bacterium gene transfer event. Whilst making these points it is important to reiterate a key conclusion from our First Report that gene transfer potential would be reduced by the minimisation of bacterial DNA sequences that are integrated into GM plants. Many of the genes introduced into GM plants are based on bacterial gene sequences, but are synthesised de novo in the laboratory to include more appropriate codon usage for more efficient expression in plants (e.g. the Bt toxin). This reduces the likelihood that they would be expressed if reintroduced into bacteria.
The transcription activity of CaMV p35S is considered in relation to the recent paper by Vlasák et al. 2003 in Section 2.2.14.
Broader horizontal gene transfer issues
Main points made by commentators
One group of commentators93 stated that our First Report had inadequately addressed: differences in the GI-tract between species; the use of transgenes from higher organisms that can be transferred to microorganisms; and HGT in relation to yeasts and other non-bacterial microorganisms in the GI-tract.
The Panel’s response
In general, commentators seemed satisfied with the scope of our Review. As we indicated above, in our response on the evidence for horizontal gene transfer in the GI-tract, more research is needed into gene transfer in the gastro-intestinal tract. This is true of these other areas mentioned by commentators.
Antibiotic resistance markers
Main points made by commentators
Several commentators93 94 95 96 stated that we had inadequately addressed the issue of the use of antibiotic resistance markers in relation to horizontal gene transfer.
The Panel’s response
Our First Report identified concerns that an antibiotic resistant gene present in a GM plant might be transferred to bacteria potentially leading to the development of antibiotic resistant pathogens. This issue was discussed both with respect to the likelihood of a trans-kingdom plant to bacterium gene transfer event taking place in the first place, and with respect to the consequences should such an event occur. Our First Report highlights scientific arguments and data that suggest a postulated gene transfer event would be of very low likelihood and valid arguments that any subsequent impact would be minimal. Marker rescue driven by DNA homology between bacteria and GM plants has been demonstrated experimentally and this led to the comment that minimisation of bacterial DNA sequences in GM plants was desirable. Clearly, antibiotic resistance genes fall into this category and a clear distinction was made between the use of the nptII gene to select plant transformation and the unnecessary inclusion

 62

of other genes. The point was made that alternative selection processes and marker removal systems exist, but their safety also needs to be established.
4.3.4 The effect of GM derived feed in the food chain Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Animal feed is a major product of conventional agriculture, and of crops developed using GM technology. The processing of crops into animal feed often completely degrades such constituents as DNA and proteins, but this cannot be assumed always to be the case. Most DNA is degraded in the gut, but some survives and there is evidence that some DNA fragments from feed ingested by poultry and livestock can appear in the blood and other tissues.
However, food and feed safety studies have been unable to find introduced feed DNA or its gene products in milk, meat or eggs produced from animals fed GM crops. Many millions of people, particularly in the United States, Canada and Argentina, have for up to seven years been eating food products derived from animals fed on GM diets and no substantiated ill effects have been reported. There is a similarly lack of evidence for any adverse effects of GM feed on the health, welfare and productivity of livestock.
However, as mentioned in relation to nutritional and toxicological differences, the absence of readily observable adverse effects in humans or animals does not mean that these can be completely ruled out for any crop GM or non-GM, conventional or novel. For example, rare, mild or long-term adverse effects are not easy to detect and could in future be the subject of post-marketing monitoring and surveillance. The safety assessment of crops with significantly altered nutritional qualities will need careful consideration where there may not be historical knowledge of assumed safe use.’
Main points made by commentators
Commentators did not raise any significant issues that exclusively fell into this area (which we addressed in Section 5.5 of our First Report). Issues with some relevance to GM derived feed are considered in Sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.3.
4.4 CHAPTER 6: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF GM CROPS
4.4.1 Invasiveness/persistence of GM plants
Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Notwithstanding the case-by-case approach taken by the regulatory authorities in evaluating invasiveness, there are two principal models that have been influential in considering the potential for GM crops to become more invasive of natural habitats than their conventional counterparts. One is the alien species model. The hypothesis is that roughly 0.1% of introduced GM plants would become pests, because that was the rate of invasive alien plants
63

species (some 15 problem plants out of an estimated 15,000 alien species introduced into the UK). The other is the crop model, which argues that GM crops will behave in much the same way as conventional crop plants except for the GM trait that may influence fitness. Conventional annual crop plants generally do not prosper outside arable fields. Although escaped plants of crop species are found, they do not tend to increase in abundance but are replenished each year by fresh ‘escapes’. Detailed field experiments on several GM crops in a range of environments have demonstrated that the transgenic traits investigated do not significantly increase the fitness of these plants in semi-natural habitats, and therefore they behave in a similar way to non-GM crops.
We do not have an exact understanding of what changes in a plant’s life history will affect its invasiveness. More knowledge on the potential effects of releasing GM plants with traits such as pest and disease resistance and stress tolerance is required since these may significantly alter a crop plant’s ability to survive outside the agricultural environment. In particular, we need to know whether GM for fitness-affecting traits like growth rate, longevity, plant size, or survivorship in plant species with potentially more invasive life histories (e.g. woody plants, perennial grasses, thicket-forming herbs) is consequential.’
Main points made by commentators
Some commentators97 98 noted the prominence given to the PROSAMO experiment in this chapter, and drew attention to what they considered its limitations. These included the comment that invasiveness of undisturbed habitats was only studied when the crops concerned might be invasive of disturbed habitats, and that only a limited number of GM types were tested.
Some commentators felt that invasions of arable fields are an important nature conservation issue. Also more prominence should have been given to the invasive potential of crop/wild plant hybrids as discussed in the work of Snow &amp; Pilson (2003).
Other commentators98 believed that generalisations about invasiveness based on specific examples were not valid and pointed to the work on viruses by Cooper et al. (2001) and Quemada (1990). The relevance of various models was questioned97. Furthermore, they questioned the data that invasiveness would be determined by the additional trait(s) and not some unanticipated or pleiotropic effect as mentioned in this chapter. It was pointed out that small genetic changes could have large effects (Williamson 1993) and that experiments testing all eventualities are difficult to design (Parker &amp; Karieva 1996). Equally, long-term evolutionary processes were not considered. The comment that sterility traits might be used to prevent invasions discounted the fact that some invasive plants are vegetatively propagated.
The Panel’s response
The PROSAMO experiment (Crawley et al. 2001) remains the only study comparing the invasiveness of GM plants and controls, and was designed to test whether the transgenic

 64

process might produce plants that could be more invasive of natural habitats than their conventional counterparts. It included a perennial plant (potato) and all replicates included an experimental disturbance treatment. It showed that the transgenic plants were not more invasive or more persistent than their conventional counterparts under conditions where the transgene was selectively neutral; there was no herbicide treatment so the HT genes provided no known advantage to the GM plants. Thus the experiment provides important data about the starting point for assessment of other GM plants, because it demonstrates that transgenesis does not per se make plants more invasive. For complete risk assessment, constructs and genes used for specific transformations must be assessed for invasiveness on a case-by-case basis.
Invasions in arable fields can be of both agronomic and nature conservation importance in the UK and are referred to in our First Report regarding the potential problems of increased herbicide resistance in arable weeds (Chapter 6.4, page 137). The subject of crop/wild plant hybrids was discussed in Chapter 7 on Gene Flow and their potential for invading arable and natural habitats recognized as one of the possible consequences of gene flow.
Snow et al. (2003) demonstrate increased fecundity in hybrids from wild sunflowers crossed with Bt sunflower, pointing out the potential for increased fitness because of the transgene. The study is not designed as a complete population study of the kind appropriate for an assessment of the risk of invasion and is considerably different in aims to the PROSAMO experiments. Seed production was greater in plants protected by the transgene from insect herbivores, with a significant increase of 55% noted in one locality. The study shows an effect on fecundity but does not demonstrate that recruitment is seed-limited, which would relate the results to fitness and potential for invasiveness. 55% more seeds may not mean 55% more plants in the next generation and field studies, which would be desirable, need to last more than one whole generation to address questions of fitness and (trans-) gene ecology.
Our First Report supports the idea of case-by-case assessment and points out that generic risk assessment or approval of all GM crops is inappropriate; the evidence discussed above shows the starting point for case-by-case assessment based on our understanding of population biology and genetics (and underpinned by the paradigms of evolutionary biology).
There are minimal data or models for long-term evolutionary processes associated with transgenic crops, so these were not considered in detail and we acknowledge that such uncertainties should be tackled by a programme of monitoring, as is starting to be done with conventional agriculture. The limitations of monitoring were discussed.
In our First Report we discuss how genetic isolation methods (including sterility) can reduce gene flow (page 207), and potential for transfer of sterility genes from GM crops into wild populations (page 222). Sterile GM plants, like vegetatively propagated alien species, could become invasive and this potential should be considered as part of the case-by-case assessment.

4.4.2 Toxicity to wildlife
Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Crop breeding, whether through genetic modification or ‘conventional’ methods, has the potential to alter levels of plant toxins or create novel compounds that are toxic to some wildlife. Such effects are unusual but they are a key element of the risk assessment process for experimental and commercial release of GM crops. The principal risks arise for crops that have been deliberately bred to contain toxins to control key pests or diseases. GM pest- and disease-resistant crops are unlikely to be grown commercially in the UK in the near future. Nevertheless, evidence from the USA and China indicates that for some, but not all, GM pest- resistant crops there have been significant reductions in pesticide use. In every case when attempting to determine the effects of pest-resistance, it is necessary to judge the crop- pesticide combination as a ‘system’ rather than simply considering the ecological impacts of the crop in isolation
There is little scientific dispute about the fact that GM plants engineered to produce toxins can sometimes be toxic to non-target wildlife, since even in nature toxins are rarely species- specific. However, no significant adverse effects on non-target wildlife resulting from toxicity of GM ‘Bt ‘ plants, for example, have so far been observed in the field. This suggests that Bt crops are generally beneficial to in-crop biodiversity in comparison to conventional crops that receive regular, broad-spectrum insecticide applications. Despite this, benefits would probably be restricted (or even negated) if Bt crops required insecticide applications to control target or secondary pests that were not sufficiently controlled by the Bt toxin. Studies on the impacts of GM crops on soil processes have shown some differences in soil microbial community structure, but so far there does not seem to be any convincing evidence to show that GM crops could adversely affect soil health in the long term. The differences in soil microbial communities observed beneath GM crops have been within the range of variation in microbial community structure and of the order of magnitude of the differences observed under different crops of even different cultivars of the same crop. However, almost all this data is drawn from small-scale, short-term studies and there is a need for larger, more agronomically realistic studies to be undertaken to demonstrate absence of harm to non-target organisms.
There tends to be scientific disagreement about the amount of information needed to demonstrate that growing GM pest and disease-resistant crops is environmentally sustainable in the long term. Some scientists argue that current evidence of reductions in pesticide use and increases in biodiversity compared to conventional crops are sufficient to demonstrate absence of adverse impacts, while others advocate the need for a greater fundamental understanding of the underlying processes.
Most of the possible negative impacts of GM crops on biodiversity are likely to be reversible, so small-scale field trials to test for impacts on relevant ecosystems are unlikely to pose any long-term environmental risks. After a crop has been approved for commercial use, the monitoring systems required for GM crops grown in the EU provide a valuable mechanism to collect ecologically relevant data. This will be useful to enhance our understanding of the impacts of GM pest-resistant crops on non-target species.’

Main points made by commentators
Criticisms99 included that the section did not explore some of limitations on assessing the specificity of toxins, given that testing is often on a restricted range of species; the lack of mention that the ecological role of Bt is unknown, which increases uncertainties; the section mentioned, but did not review, the evidence for changes in some non-target pests with Joubert et al. (2001) on cotton quoted. Another commentator100 noted that little information is available on the ecological impacts of GM crops on non-target species obtained from experimental field research under realistic commercial release conditions. Also studies of the impacts on vertebrates (especially birds known to eat crops) of commonly-used GM-derived endotoxins are lacking in the scientific literature.
One commentator101 felt that it is necessary to compare the potential effects on wildlife of Bt crops, limited to a few insects and only those ingesting the crop, with current methods of reducing crop loss using broader spectrum insecticides applied over the top of the crop.
One commentator102 noted that this section refers to two pests not currently a problem in the UK, but that with climate change that situation could change.
Other commentators mentioned concerns about soil. One103 quoted our conclusion on page 132 that ‘so far there does not seem to be any convincing evidence to show that GM crops could adversely affect soil health in the long term’ but suggested that may be because the needed research in this area has not been done. On page 135 we stated that ‘More field research on the impacts of pest- and disease-resistant GM crops on soil microorganisms and processes should be carried out in advance of commercialisation’. One102 of our commentators agreed that this was among the most striking gaps in knowledge that show little sign of being filled.
Other commentators102 highlighted two issues: reductions in insecticide use; and impacts on non-target fauna. In addition, the commentator was critical of the scientific rigour and quality of some of the studies cited in this section of our First Report. They agreed that one paper (Phipps &amp; Park, 2002) clearly established reduced insecticide use in countries where GM crops had been planted. They pointed out that other studies cited in our First Report (such as: Carpenter et al. 2002, Carriere et al. 2003)104 did not present rigorous scientific data on reductions of insecticides associated with GM insect resistant crops. They concluded that although Phipps &amp; Parks present data supporting the contention that insecticide use is reduced in areas where GMIR crops are used, there are no studies that directly relate such reductions to the large-scale use of these crops.

The Panel’s response
Risk assessment is a pragmatic process which may not provide all the answers, but tries to focus on the most important parameters. Although it may not be feasible to perform laboratory tests on all species that could potentially be harmed, appropriately designed field studies may enable monitoring of a wider range of species and may also be an important element of risk assessments. Commentators’ criticisms about testing of inappropriate species mostly relate to risk assessments on Bt plants that were done over ten years ago for commercial release in the USA, whereas more recent risk assessments have increasingly focused on identifying ecologically relevant species in the field and testing them in the lab, e.g. Hilbeck (2002). We recognize that particular scrutiny should be paid to applications for commercial release to determine whether ecologically relevant species have been tested.
Lack of knowledge on the ecological role of Bt was mentioned in our First Report (page 121). The commentator referred to the work of Joubert et al. (2001). However, this paper is
unrefereed.
We agree that studies of the impacts on vertebrates (especially birds known to eat crops) of commonly-used GM-derived endotoxins are lacking in the scientific literature. However risk assessments are carried out using the laboratory evidence-based assumption that the Bt toxin is not harmful to vertebrates. Therefore it is not generally expected in risk assessments on individual releases that extensive data is needed to demonstrate lack of adverse effects on populations of vertebrates in the field.
The majority of field studies that have been carried out at research stations on ecological effects of Bt compare Bt crops with conventional pest control methods. One problem is that on farms, additional pesticides are often used on the GM crop to deal with non-target pests. Following the success of the FSE experimental protocol, similar studies could be carried out on Bt crops to compare their impacts with conventional pesticide treatment in realistic commercial situations.
So far as the impact of climate change on pest distribution is concerned, there would be little point in trying to carry out experiments that do not reflect current agronomic practice. If and when these pests become a problem in the UK, and Bt crops are proposed for commercial growing as a solution, comparative studies could be informative.
We agreed in our First Report that more field research on the impacts of pest- and disease- resistant GM crops on soil micro-organisms and processes should be carried out. However experiments would have to be crop specific and apart from Bt maize, no other GM pest or disease resistant crops are even close to commercialisation in the UK. However, we also have to be realistic about agricultural soils, which in general are already highly modified by conventional cultivation, e.g. ploughing, fertilizer and pesticide applications, compression, erosion, etc. Evidence so far from Bt crops suggests that impacts of individual crop varieties are likely to be far less than differences between agricultural practices.
Additionally, it might be useful in future to gather evidence for changes in pesticide inputs following introduction of GM insect resistant crops. Key questions could include: Are effects different for different crops? What are the longer-term trends? What is the relationship between inputs and impacts?
68

We agree with the contributor that the data presented in Phipps &amp; Park (2002) support the view that commercial use of such crops is correlated with reductions in insecticide use.
The contributor’s fifth point deals with evidence of impacts of GMIR crops on non-target organisms. They state ‘there is actually no evidence of ...positive benefits in any peer- reviewed publications that we have been able to find’. They cite: Carpenter et al. 2002; Pimental &amp; Raven, 2000; Musser &amp; Shelton, 2003; and Gregory et al. 2002, which were papers reviewed in Section 6.6.4 of our First Report, and conclude that none of this literature presents convincing data supporting the hypothesis that the use of GMIR crops has neutral or positive effects on non-target fauna.
We agree with the conclusion for some of the studies cited, but the Carpenter et al. paper does cite some lab-based studies where no adverse effects were found, and whilst Musser &amp; Shelton did not find a significant reduction in natural enemies of lepidopteran pests in fields of Bt sweetcorn, they found that using conventional insecticides had an adverse impact on these organisms. However the extensive work done on impacts of GMIR corn (maize) on non-target lepidoptera in the United States cited in Section 6.3.3 of our First Report (Sears et al. 2001), lends support to the view that, when compared to conventional insecticide use, GMIR corn has little if any impact on populations of non-target insects and may be beneficial. Section 6.3 of our First Report contains an extensive and more rigorous review of this issue than the section cited by the contributor.
We agree with the contributor that there is a need for more formal experimental science to investigate the impact of specific GMIR crops on biodiversity. We say in Section 6.3.6 (page 134) of our First Report that there is a need for more agronomically realistic ecological studies of this kind. We would emphasise that such experiments should be at field scale and must always compare the GMIR system with other ways of controlling insects, especially the use of insecticide sprays.
4.4.3 Development of resistance Summary conclusions from First Report
‘A key long-standing target of ‘traditional’ plant breeding, including some uses of genetic modification, has been the development of crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases. Widespread, uniform cultivation of these varieties, together with any agrochemicals applied to reduce the incidence of disease or to kill weeds, provide a strong selection pressure for the emergence/evolution of resistant target organisms (pests, pathogen and weeds) that can attack the new variety or survive the pesticide application. The time it takes for a resistant target organism to emerge depends on the nature of the toxins and how they are expressed, the ecology, genetics and mating behaviour of the target organism(s), the mode of action of the toxin, and on the effectiveness of the crop management techniques deployed by farmers.
Current widespread scientific opinion is that ‘single dominant resistance gene’ mechanisms are less durable than resistance controlled by several genes. However, some sources of GM resistance, including Bt genes that confer resistance to a narrow range of target insects, appear to be particularly robust. However, there is no a priori reason to suppose that resistance genes
69

introduced by GM will be any less susceptible to ‘breakdown ‘than those introduced by slower conventional breeding methods.
Over 120 species of weeds have been recorded worldwide that have become resistant to various herbicides in association with herbicide-tolerant crops, irrespective of whether tolerance was obtained by GM or conventional breeding technologies. Weeds that are closely related and hybridise freely with the cultivated herbicide-tolerant crop variety have the added possibility of obtaining tolerance gene(s) directly from the crop. However, unless the weed is exposed to the herbicide in question, this does not pose any ecological or selective advantage.
Therefore, although resistance-breaking strains of pathogens, pests or weeds can be expected to emerge, there is no reason to expect different responses depending on whether a crop's resistance was introduced by GM or by conventional breeding methods.
However, since GM has frequently employed genes which confer resistance to common herbicides and pesticides (e.g. glyphosate and Bt) in its weed and pest control strategies, impacts on agriculture and possibly biodiversity could be significant if some target organisms developed resistance to these compounds. The extent and possible severity of impacts on the environment are difficult to quantify and subject to much debate.’
Main points made by commentators
Some commentators105 felt that the section did not give enough consideration to the fact that GM uniquely enables the same gene construct to be used in a range of crops across the world, which in their view raises new areas of uncertainty in terms of emergence of resistance and could make it more problematic. For instance, one commentator106 was concerned about the potential of moths in the U.S. to hinder efforts to stem development of resistance because they fed on corn all summer and flew south to eat cotton, citing Gould et al. (2002) in support of this view. One commentator107 drew attention to new research by Sayyed et al. (2003) suggesting that some resistant insects might be able to use the toxins in GM plants as a supplementary food protein, which was an unexpected effect. Another commentator108 contended that Glyphosate-resistant marestail has already infested over 200,000 acres of cotton in the U.S.A. and cited by Ho &amp; Cummins (2002) as the source of this and other examples of resistant weeds.
One commentator109 felt that any change in management that may increase the rate of appearance of weeds resistant to glyphosate is a concern, and wanted the Panel to consider a number of further questions. These included: whether characteristics of the use of glyphosate with GMHT crops could exacerbate the emergence of resistant weeds; what responses to resistance could be expected from UK farmers, and what would be the environmental consequences of these responses; in relation to perennial weeds, could reduced application rates and sub-optimal timing increase the potential for resistance in perennial weeds; and what would be the implications of GMHT cereals?

Some commentators105 stated that one of the main challenges with resistance management is whether farmers will be able, or willing, to comply with the systems put in place, and they felt that we had not fully consider evidence from the US that up to 33% of farmers did not comply, quoting a New Scientist report (Coghlan 2001)110.
One commentator111 was concerned that ‘gene-stacking’ discussed on page 143 of our First Report was said not to be a problem because of the multiplicity of available herbicides But it failed to mention that this may imply the use of older, more toxic, herbicides although it did refer to English Nature’s concern about the impact of paraquat and diquat on hares. Another commentator112 said that incidents of such harm are rare and quoted Edwards et al. (2000) in support of this view.
The Panel’s response
We believe that on this issue, as for other areas of our Review, the primary focus should be on peer-reviewed research.
Herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, are used in a range of crops and so the development of resistance is not new. If a herbicide is successful, it will be applied to all crops. Therefore, we feel that this is not a new issue.
The reference to an example of marestail invading cotton fields is misplaced, since the cotton in question is conventional, and not GM, cotton.
We agree that one of the main challenges with resistance management is whether farmers will be willing to comply with the systems put in place. However this is true for all regulatory frameworks and systems.
4.4.4 New weed control strategies offered by GM herbicide tolerant crops
Summary conclusions from First Report
‘GM herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops enable new weed control strategies. The key possibility is the replacement of existing approved but persistent, toxic herbicides by those with a more benign environmental profile. They may also enable farmers to spray crops less frequently and to relax weed management practices for conventional crops at different stages in the rotation. Hence they are an attractive option for farmers wishing to simplify crop management. It may also be possible to delay the date of herbicide application, avoid pre- sowing weed treatments and so leave emerging weeds in the fields for longer. Such a result might have benefits for biodiversity, though this claim is largely speculative and is not strongly supported by the current small-scale experimental studies. Similarly, evidence from

 71

the USA indicates that tillage can be reduced in HT crops, which provides environmental benefits that may not necessarily be relevant to the UK.
Fifty years of agricultural intensification has undoubtedly led to a decline in farmland biodiversity, but the role of herbicides in this decline is unclear. Broad spectrum herbicides used in conjunction with GMHT crops are known to provide highly efficient and reliable weed control in comparison to many ‘conventional’ herbicide regimes, and if their use resulted in fewer weed seeds and further declines in weed populations then organisms depending on those weeds during part of their life cycle could be adversely affected. We do not yet have sufficient evidence to predict what the long-term impacts of GMHT crops might be on weed populations. An important uncertainty is how farmers will apply this technology in the field.
The publication of the UK farm-scale evaluations of GMHT crops will clarify some of these uncertainties. Inevitably others will remain. The question would become more complex if farmers were to grow two or more herbicide tolerant crops in rotation.’
Main points made by commentators
Some commentators113 felt that this is a comprehensive and detailed account of our state of knowledge.
One commentator114 contended that the report cited by Chamberlain et al. (2001, not 2002) did not show that the FSEs are too small to assess the impacts on birds, and given its conclusions, it was strange that the work on birds was not continued for the full three years of the FSEs.
One commentator115 questioned the use of the reference to Dewar et al. (2000), and did not think it provided evidence for suggesting that GMHT crops could reduce aphicide use – the opposite could also be true.
Another commentator116 observed that there is an impact of pesticides on soil and its micro- organisms, both of which are diminishing in quantity and quality across the world, and our First Report had not adequately evaluated the possible harmful effects of the accumulated use of glyphosate or glufosinate against this background.
One commentator117 drew attention to new research (Defra, 2003d) on modelling the effects on farmland food webs of herbicide and insecticide management in the agricultural eco- system October 2003 and the need to consider this in the Review.

 72

The Panel’s response
The comparison we made in our first report was with conventional agriculture and thus we compared the impacts of the use of glyphosate and glufosinate against the alternatives.
The paper by Dewar et al. (2003) explored short-term consequences of introducing GMHT crops on farmland biodiversity by examining the possibility that spraying can be delayed in GMHT crops because the weed control is easier and possible even for large weeds. This showed that delayed spraying leads to increased weed biomass, which then leads to higher arthropod densities. This effect is increased if this is coupled with initial band spraying. Freckleton et al. (2003) review weed phenologies and create a population model which shows that many weeds are unlikely to benefit in the long run as spraying is generally delayed insufficiently to allow most species to set seed. The effects shown in Dewar's experiments are thus likely to be short term. Freckleton et al. (2003) do however show that if spraying is stopped earlier in the season then a viable population of large emerging weed species can persist.
The Defra report was published after our First Report, but is described in Section 2.
4.4.5 Horizon scanning
Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Over the next ten years, there is the possibility of introducing GM crops resistant to attack by insects, nematodes, fungi, bacteria or viruses. In all cases, we would expect these to enable reductions in pesticide use. There are potential negative impacts on non-target organisms, but in the case of insect resistance, field studies on commercially grown Bt crops have failed to identify any adverse effects. In addition, subject to regulatory approval, there will be imports of GM food, feed and fibre, with improved shelf life or nutritional quality, but these are not expected to affect the UK environment.
Further ahead, it becomes more difficult to make confident predictions about the commercialisation of GM crops and their possible environmental impacts. The horizon scan has identified the paucity of baseline data and models at different scales, from field to landscape scale, which is needed as a basis for future assessment of large-scale environmental effects. Many of the issues foreseen are not unique to GM crops and will be driven by economic, social and political rather than purely scientific factors. Current research points to GM crops for certain non-food purposes: pharmaceuticals, speciality and bulk chemicals and biomass for energy. These could provide renewable resources for industry, provide new medicines and could diversify rural landscapes and economies. Conversely, there could be undesired effects on wildlife caused by the way these crops might be managed and/or changes in patterns of land use. Another longer-term possibility is the development of traits aimed at improving crop production in marginal environments (e.g. tolerance of drought, heat or salt) with obvious advantages to certain growers in these environments. However, such crops could become more successful as weeds, there could be economic pressure to cultivate areas with wildlife and conservation value, and there might be adverse socio-economic and political consequences, for example with regard to optimal farm size.’
73

Main points made by commentators
Some commentators118 felt that, perhaps inevitably, the section was superficial and of questionable value to the review. The account of prospects for biofuels was given as an example of an area that had not been sufficiently explored, and Murphy (2002) cited as providing a more critical evaluation.
Some commentators118 also noted that despite our First Report emphasising the need to make comparative evaluations with other non-GM options, this section failed to do so. Similarly, one commentator119 felt that the report focused on the perceived risks associated with GM crops and foods but did not address the risks associated with not fully exploring or evaluating the opportunities to use GM crops.
Another commentator120 asked whether the Panel had any evidence as to whether the unexpected effects of GM traits mentioned in the ‘Limitations on Science’ section (Saxena &amp; Stotzky 2001 on lignin in Bt corn, soya bean stem splitting) might limit the practical application of any of the traits mentioned in the horizon scanning section, particularly where multiple traits were involved. Do the risks of unforeseen effects on a plant increase as the genetic modifications make it more numerous or complicated, and will we have to make choices between traits because plants will only be able to cope with so much change? If so, these factors should be fed into horizon-scanning exercises. The same commentator queried whether unexpected effects such as raised lignin levels could have an effect on food chains.
The Panel’s response
Comparative evaluations with other non-GM options were not made, as we are unaware of any specific, peer-reviewed research on this issue. Nor did the report address the risks associated with not fully exploring or evaluating the opportunities to use GM crops as this was outside the scope of the Science Review. Readers are encouraged to read the Strategy Unit publication ‘Field Work: weighing up the costs and benefits of GM crops (July 2003)’. Our First Report covers the paper by Saxena and Stotzky (2001) in detail on page 187.
4.4.6 Changes in agricultural practice Summary conclusions from First Report
‘It is widely acknowledged that modern (non-GM) agriculture has already had significant negative impacts on biodiversity and the wider environment in the UK. Large changes over the last century, including recent decades, in the way farmland is managed have resulted in a decline in farmland plant, invertebrate and bird abundance and diversity.
The consequences of commercial growing of GM crops in the UK would depend on the nature of each individual technology and the decisions made by farmers, the public and policy makers. For example, some GM technologies could increase agricultural intensification, to

 74

produce more from the same area of land, while other niche and specialist GM crops could increase the diversity of the landscape. Some GM crops would lead to reduced agrochemical use while others would have the opposite effect.
Each potential agricultural application of genetic modification must, therefore, be examined on a case-by-case basis, taking careful account of the physical, social and political environments within which it would be deployed. There is a major need for policy makers to understand how these factors are likely to interface with the new technologies, to enable prediction of environmental outcomes and thus delivery of environmental targets because they will predict outcomes from the environment if targets are to be delivered.’
Main points made by commentators
Some commentators121 felt that scenarios in this section were entirely based on the technology and failed to consider other changes or alternatives. They also felt that the analysis in this section was weak and partial, including the assessment of whether GM would reduce biodiversity, whether GM would increase crop rotations, and whether GM would bring economic benefits. They contended that Bt corn in Spain has not been universally successful, quoting a report by FOE and Greenpeace122. They also argued that GM would bring new problems to farmers including dealing with resistances, meeting traceability and labelling requirements, and that choice for the farmer would be undermined by GM crops. These points were not, in their view, adequately addressed in the section.
Another commentator123 felt that the report does not make clear enough that the major environmental impacts of any new or existing crop are determined by how it is managed. It was suggested that what is required is a blueprint for farming that sets out society’s requirements for food, industrial raw materials, landscape and water management, and environmental goods. Technologies and management systems can then be applied to meet those objectives. In general, the report gave insufficient prominence to the role of politics and economics in driving and controlling the direction of farming and food production.
Another commentator124 felt that this was a reasonable attempt to address a difficult subject, but should have focused far more on those GM crops close to consent decisions rather than indulging in much ‘look-forward’ speculation, an area where science is of little help. The same commentator was surprised that the general conclusion of this section was that the introduction of GM crops would be likely to result in more diverse agricultural landscapes when there is no evidence to support this. The section did not fully explore what is already known of the changes in agricultural practice associated with GMHT and GMIR crops, including work by Read &amp; Bush (1998) and Read &amp; Ball (1999).

The Panel’s response
Our First Report set out a range of potential scenarios for changes in agricultural practices following the adoption of GM crops. This stated that some GM crops could result in increased biological diversity in the landscape, and some could lead to greater homogenisation. The range of possibilities for both short- and long-term changes are set out in more detail in Pretty (2001).
We acknowledge that politics and economics are critical drivers for the direction of food and farming systems. There is likely to be significant change following the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy in 2003 that will shift payments from food production subsidies to optimising the supply of environmental goods and services. This will not lead to a new `blueprint’ for farming, but will raise new questions about what society at large wants from multifunctional agricultural systems using a wide range of production technologies.
The report by Brookes (2002) provides new data on Bt maize cultivation across Spain. This indicates that the FOE and Greenpeace study focused on maize in a small-scale trial only in regions where there was low pest pressure. Elsewhere in the country, Bt maize had been cultivated by farmers with agronomic and economic success to date compared with conventional varieties. The question of the development of resistance is dealt with in Section 4.4.3.
4.4.7 Limitations of science Summary conclusions from First Report
‘There are several approaches for determining the ecological consequences of GM crops. Examples include extrapolations from experience with comparable traits or with other crop varieties that are in some or all ways ‘equivalent’, laboratory and field experiments, experience of GM crops, and ecological modelling. In practice it is usually necessary to use a number of these methods in combination.
Most of the environmental issues raised by growing currently available GM crops do not differ qualitatively from conventional crops. In both the GM and conventional context, we are limited in our ability to predict ecological changes within complex systems. This applies to a wide range of ecological issues and to many aspects of agriculture: modern intensive, organic or conventional. Important gaps in knowledge include the possible rate of uptake of GM crops in the UK; detailed knowledge of farmland ecology; soil ecology.’
Main points made by commentators
Some commentators125 felt that the section made excessive claims for the FSEs, particularly in the summary, which did not reflect other important areas of uncertainty discussed in the text. They did not agree that indirect effects of GMHT crops posed the only significant risk, which was the impression given by this section.
125 Combined comments from: Econexus, The Five Year Freeze, Friends of the Earth, GeneWatch UK, Greenpeace, The Soil Association, and Dr M Antoniou. See Annex I.
 76

The same commentators were also looking for a discussion of overarching issues, which in their view included: the practical constraints of experimental design (including financial); the problems of extrapolating from small to large and commercial scale; the difficulties of detecting small incremental changes which become significant only over long time periods; lack of knowledge of complex ecological interactions; and different types of error and constraints on modelling. They also felt that the limitations of the case by case approach were not sufficiently evaluated, which included the exclusion of comparative assessment of different options; that cumulative impacts are not adequately dealt with, and an excessive emphasis on the introduced trait which diverts attention from pleiotropic impacts.
Another commentator126 agreed with our First Report that the regulatory processes must consider each GM crop as an individual case, but emphasized the need for this process to embrace the principle of risk management. The same commentator supported the view that large scale studies are needed to help determine the impacts of GM crops on wildlife, non- target organisms, soil and below-ground processes, and contended that a nationally co- ordinated, properly designed and adequately funded monitoring scheme is required to detect future changes in biodiversity.
The Panel’s response
The FSEs, which were not published at the time of our First Report, are considered in Section 3. They aimed to look at ‘indirect’ effects of GMHT crops, but as indicated by the scale required to detect significant effects and as suggested by the commentator, such effects are difficult to find unless large and quick. As in the FSEs, such analysis is often required in a comparative context because of the continuing changes imposed by conventional and alternative agricultural strategies. Data and methods to measure direct effects are discussed in Chapter 6.3 and elsewhere in our First Report. Our review checklist (page 39, question 5) specifically considered options for monitoring of GM crops (as well as food/feed) after release. Current regulatory oversight requires applicants to consider direct, indirect, immediate and delayed effects. The difficulties in measuring fitness are discussed in Section 4.4.1.
4.4.8 Monitoring
Main points made by commentators
One commentator127 felt that our First Report did not place enough weight on the value of monitoring and may exaggerate the difficulties. This commentator felt that there has been little direct attempt to monitor the impact of individual agronomic practices until now, and even expensive schemes designed to provide environmental benefits have been poorly evaluated, citing Kleijn &amp; Sutherland (in press) in support of this view. The authors of this paper argue powerfully that evaluation of the effectiveness of such schemes should become an integral part of their introduction and the same applies to the monitoring of other major agricultural developments.

The same commentator believed that the Panel should look more critically at the statistical underpinning of reports of ‘no effect’. This was echoed by a number of other commentators who questioned the use of anecdotal alongside data-derived evidence.
The Panel’s response
The value of monitoring was highlighted in the Report (page 135). ACRE has recently published guidance on monitoring which should help in the development of effective monitoring strategies128.
We stand by our original conclusion that it will be very difficult to pick up the changes due to the introduction of GM crops alongside the other considerable changes that are likely to occur within UK agriculture in the near future as a result of economic, social, climatic and technological changes. General monitoring of biodiversity is clearly important. It was such monitoring established by the British Trust for Ornithology that resulted in the detection of the direct effects of organophosphate pesticides on birds and later detected the changes in farmland birds.
On the issue of statistical underpinning, we believe that an ‘estimation approach’ is preferable to hypothesis testing. In particular, we concur with the FSE statisticians and the contributor, that it is preferable to produce confidence intervals for parameters of interest, rather than simply carrying out a hypothesis test of ‘no effect’. Power analysis is helpful in designing an experiment, but a confidence interval, as the contributor points out, explicitly gives the range of effects consistent with the data observed. The published analysis of the FSE experiments is an excellent piece of statistical work.
In contexts such as the FSEs, it is entirely appropriate to use a design, which achieves power of 80% at a given level of an effect. Power of 80% for an effect of magnitude 1.5 means that if the true effect is 1.5 then the chance of rejecting the null hypothesis of ‘no effect’ is 0.8. It does not mean that an effect of magnitude 1.5 is ruled out if the null hypothesis is not rejected. The question ‘will an effect of size 1.5 normally be detected?’ is different from ‘if the null hypothesis of no effect is accepted, could the true effect be as large as 1.5?’
Detailed publication of data always makes it possible to analyse the data in a different way. While Bayesian methods are undoubtedly increasing in prevalence in many areas, their use in the biological literature is not yet standard, and for contexts such as the FSE's, it is completely appropriate to use the classical approach adopted.

4.5 CHAPTER 7: GENE FLOW, DETECTION AND IMPACT OF GM CROPS
4.5.1 Gene flow between crop varieties Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Genes can move between different varieties of the same species by the spread of seed and by cross-pollination. The complete genetic isolation of crops grown on a commercial scale, either GM or non-GM, is not practical at present. However, gene flow can be minimised, as currently happens in the case of oilseed rape varieties grown for food, feed or industrial oils. The levels at which gene flow can be maintained for different crop varieties are significant in determining whether co-existence of different types of agriculture is feasible. However, political decisions may ultimately affect whether co-existence is practical, in particular what thresholds are set for maximum GM presence in non-GM crops (and their products), whether conventional or organic. For some crops, maintaining thresholds of gene flow may be relatively straightforward, by employing separation distances and, more importantly, by reducing gene flow through seed. However, in other cases it may be difficult, if not impossible, to grow certain crops or use some existing farming practices (e.g. using farm- saved oilseed rape seed on farms where both GM and non-GM varieties are grown).
Gene flow from GM crops that have been approved for commercial release can be detected but unapproved GMOs present difficulties. Gene flow may be detected if commonly used transgenic DNA is present, but the actual source of the GM presence will be difficult, maybe impossible, to identify. Detection methods are very sensitive but they cannot guarantee a total absence of transgenic content. Equally, false positives may indicate that transgenic DNA is present when it is not.
‘Gene stacking’ is the accumulation of genes conferring a range of traits as a result of cross- pollination between different varieties. It is not unique to GM crops. However, if GM crops are to be grown commercially in the UK, assessments of the potential consequences of such gene stacking may well become a more prominent consideration for regulators. GM crops that produce non-food, non-feed products such as pharmaceuticals, bioplastics or biofuels pose different regulatory issues and would, as for all GM crops, have to be judged on a case-by- case basis. In any case, such crops would (certainly, should) be designed and/or grown in ways that would preclude gene flow to food and feed crops.
More information is needed about the mechanisms and management of seed dispersal in agricultural systems, along with diagnostic and sampling methodologies for determining the extent of gene flow early in the production/supply chain. In the longer term, it is possible that gene containment systems will be developed that significantly reduce gene flow.’
Main points made by commentators
One group of commentators129 felt that the Review was over-optimistic about the prospects for limiting crop-to-crop gene flow. One commentator130 provided a detailed critique of the

separation distances suggested by the Ingram (2000) report. Other commentators131 132 felt that coexistence was achievable.
Some commentators133 felt that although the review recognized the inevitability of gene flow, and acknowledged important uncertainties in predicting gene flow between crops, it had not placed these issues in the context of public concerns, i.e. the extent to which, if at all, consumers will have a choice of GM free, UK produced food and whether UK organic farmers will be able to produce uncontaminated crops. They felt that the analysis and comment in this section should therefore have been directed at considering gene flow to non- GM crops at zero or limit of detection levels (0.1%) instead of 1%, and should have given fuller consideration to market and farming realities, including problems already experienced in Canada with HT OSR, and in Spain with Bt Maize. They also felt that the effects of multiplication over generations, increases in the area of GM crops, and feral populations were not properly addressed.
Some commentators133 also felt that gene flow had significance beyond co-existence. They argued that the review should be amended to acknowledge that gene flow per se is important and to give proper consideration to the Mexican maize contamination incident (because of the need to protect agricultural resources) and the StarLinkTM maize contamination incident (because of the possible implications for food safety). Another commentator129 underlined the importance of the Quist &amp; Chapela (2001) paper on the Mexican maize situation.
One commentator suggested several new references134.
The Panel’s response
In our First Report we reviewed the available evidence relating to gene flow. We came to the conclusion that there are uncertainties about how the factors determining co-existence in the UK will come together at commercial scale; including the combination of adventitious presence in seed, gene flow between crops in the field, and gene flow from volunteers of previous crops.
We acknowledge that the practicality for co-existence is dependent not only on the biology of adventitious presence, but also on the UK farming context. There is science available to at least guide, if not completely guarantee, the maintenance of thresholds. However, what is not known is how many farmers will want to adopt GM, how many will want to work to the organic movement’s self-imposed de facto threshold of 0.1% (and it is possible that some retailers and conventional farmers will want to work to 0.1%), and how many will want to work to the statutory threshold of 0.9%. These scenarios were not examined in detail in our First Report, but it did state that ultimately co-existence would be determined by political and economic issues including legal thresholds. The Science Review did not look in detail at the issues of choice arising from co-existence. Many of these issues are covered by the AEBC’s report.135

As one commentator correctly pointed out, the growing of maize as sweetcorn for ‘pick-your- own’ or corn on the cob, presents a special case. If grown near to GM forage maize (or GM sweetcorn), the cobs on the perimeter of the field (and possibly in pockets within the field) could have higher levels of kernels pollinated by a GM male plant than is the average across the field, and there is no post-harvest means of averaging out the effect. This problem has been the subject of advice from ACRE136.
The paper by Quist &amp; Chapela (2001) remains controversial and unique in its treatment by Nature, but did not show introgression as such. Some kernels on different cobs of a landrace gave weak but positive PCR signals indicating the presence of a transgene possibly by F1 hybridisation with nearby GM maize crops, but did not show that the gene had been stably integrated. Stewart et al. (2003) (see Section 2) asserted ‘No published data have ever shown that transgenic DNA has been unintentionally introgressed into maize landraces or into any unintended maize genome’. However, such introgression is possible. Introgression is the stable integration in a heritable state of gene(s) from one species to another following hybridisation and further backcrossing. A PCR signal is the identification of a particular DNA fragment on a gel following a Polymerase Chain Reaction to amplify the DNA.
The StarLinkTM case was discussed on page 81 of our First Report.
Our First Report also recognises the potential hazards of introducing GM pharmaceuticals into food crops. Strong recommendations against this have been made by all EU Regulatory bodies, and pharmaceutical crops are not likely to be grown in uncontained conditions.
Most of the other contributions are statements which are difficult to comment on in detail but which have been covered in Chapter 7 of our First Report. Some statements (‘there is little evidence on how different factors (seed purity, cross pollination, volunteers, gene stacking etc) will combine, which makes prediction of gene flow difficult’, ‘Non food GM crops must be separated from food varieties’, ‘GM volunteers can act as a reservoir of transgenes and lead to changes in farming practice that can affect biodiversity’ etc.) are incontestable. Some are based on misunderstanding (e.g. the Report does say that for some people gene flow of transgenes is undesirable per se.). Others, such as whether coexistence is possible, are speculative and include statements for and against, often quoting evidence from existing practice and experience with GM crops. Unless new published scientific evidence is given, as in the case of those papers dealt with in Section 2, it is probably not helpful to make further comment here.
A report by one contributor137 makes an interesting contribution to the issue of separation distances between maize fields. It revisits early (1950) experiments of Jones and Brooks in North America (experiments that Ingram (2000) cited in our First Report), used to calculate separation distances. Using a different procedure (which the author should be encouraged to submit for publication) the values for percentage outcrossing with distance are very similar to those presented by Ingram. The report goes on to say that factors such as high winds and weather conditions would considerably influence the values, and have not been accounted for in the calculations on which Ingram based the separation distances.

4.5.2 Gene flow from GM crops to agricultural weeds and wild relatives
Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Gene flow can occur from GM crops to sexually compatible wild relatives and to agricultural weeds. Cross-pollination will occur to an extent that depends on the closeness of the relationship between the species and on other conditions. However, the key issue is whether any resulting hybrid plants survive, grow and reproduce successfully allowing the new gene to be introgressed (stably introduced into the new population). Hybridisation seems overwhelmingly likely to transfer genes that are advantageous in agricultural environments, but will not prosper in the wild. This general view is supported by specific studies on oilseed rape and on sugar beet, where there has been little or no detectable gene flow to semi-natural habitats even though there can be hybridisation within a field. Furthermore, no hybrid between any crop and any wild relative has ever become invasive in the wild in the UK.
Within current agricultural practice, more than 120 non-GM herbicide-resistant species have emerged worldwide in the last 40 years. In most, but not necessarily all cases, such plants are at a disadvantage away from agricultural conditions. This disadvantage has also been found in experiments carried out on GM plants. There have been some instances in Canada, where there is complete freedom to grow several herbicide-tolerant varieties, e.g. oilseed rape, of tolerance being transferred to weeds or stacked through hybrids in one variety. However, if herbicide-tolerant crops are carefully managed, this should delay, or even prevent the emergence of any herbicide-tolerant weed problem.
Genes associated with resistance to pests and diseases have greater potential than herbicide- resistant genes to lead to the local expansion of a plant population. However, there are other natural constraints that could prevent an increase in population growth rates in such cases. Overall, genes for pest- and disease-resistance inserted into crops by conventional breeding have not produced invasions of wild relatives in semi-natural habitats.
However, there are gaps in our understanding of the potential consequences of gene flow, and the effect of particular traits on the fitness of the weed or wild relative, which may receive them, is an important target of ongoing research. In addition, several technological solutions to containing or reducing gene flow from GM crops have been proposed.’
Main points made by commentators
Some commentators138 felt that this was an extensive review of the literature and did acknowledge areas of uncertainty. However it should also have included new data on frequency of gene flow to wild relatives in the UK from Wilkinson et al. (2003).

One commentator139 felt that there was too much faith in management practices, future genetic use restriction technologies, and pollen flow limiting technologies in the report. The same commentator felt that there was no sound scientific basis for the assertion that transgenes behave in the same way as resident genes, and pointed to research that indicated that Mendelian inheritance in transgenes is more uncommon than common (Breiztger &amp; Tonks, 2003).
Some commentators138 felt that there is evidence that hybridisation can occur between wheat and a wild relative in the UK.
The Panel’s response
The new data on likely frequency of gene flow to wild relatives in the UK has been considered in our Second Report. It is actually data from a research consortium estimating the likely frequency of hybridisation (the first stage of gene flow) between oilseed rape and its wild relative Brassica rapa (Wilkinson et al. 2003). A critique is provided in Section 2.
Most of the arguments that transgenes behave differently in terms of their rates of transfer, and ability to persist, in the wild are based on the ‘absence of evidence does not constitute evidence of absence’ logic. It depends therefore on how long (over what period of time and on what scale globally) individuals believe such comparisons must be made. Statements in our First Report are based on the experience to date. One small piece of evidence quoted as supporting the idea that transgenic plants may be more outbreeding must be treated with caution. This note to Nature (Bergelson et al. 1998) on outbreeding in Arabidopsis compares two transgenic lines (with an unexplained difference between them in outbreeding rates) with a wild-type mutant against a background of unknown variation in rates of outcrossing. Follow-up research using isogenic lines in a fully comparative experimental design is needed.
Apomixis as a gene containment technology is far off from commercial development and its use and the potential risks do require a full evaluation.
A number of wild relatives of wheat (Triticum aestivum) have hybridised and introgressed with wheat in the wild (mainly in Turkey and Greece). A monograph by van Slageren (1994) lists 14 Aegilops species and two species of Triticum in this category. Several species of Secale, Agropyron, Hordeum, Elymus and Isathyrostachys have been crossed under artificial conditions with wheat – but no spontaneous hybrids with wild relatives of these species have been found in the UK. The presence of wheat specific genes in a wild plant of Elymus caninus is indirect evidence of past introgression (but could be genes shared by descent) and should alert us to seek further experimental evidence. It remains true that gene flow is less of an issue in wheat than oilseed rape for a large variety of reasons (no feral populations, many genes of domestication especially lack of dormancy, etc.).

4.5.3 Can DNA from GM crops transfer to soil microbes? Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Most plant DNA is degraded during the natural processes of decay, but there is a small possibility that genes in plant DNA could be acquired and expressed by environmental microbes. There is no evidence from complete bacterial gene sequences that genes from plants have successfully established during bacterial evolution, but bacterially derived transgenes in current use may have a higher probability of transfer to soil bacteria than average plant DNA. No such transfer under field conditions has yet been observed. However, there are limited tools, and there have been limited attempts to test the phenomenon under field conditions.
Most current transgenes are of bacterial origin. They are therefore unlikely to have any significant novel effect on bacteria that have already been exposed to them by gene transfer from other bacteria, though their similarity to bacterial DNA may increase the chance that bacteria acquire them. Inserting transgenes in plastids (i.e. chloroplasts) may increase the chance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to bacteria because of the increased copy number (several 100 copies per cell instead of 1 or 2 copies of nuclear DNA) and closer relationship to prokaryotic gene structure. Careful design of transgenes can greatly reduce the potential for HGT to bacteria. In future, inserted genes may encode proteins not found naturally. Although these will be less easily acquired by bacteria, their effects may need to be explicitly tested in representative bacteria.
HGT to other microbes, (e.g. fungi and protists), has not been as well researched as for bacteria. As with bacteria, there is some indication that the rate of transfer may not be zero. Since these are eukaryotes, some further consideration should be given to the likelihood of incorporation and expression of the transgenic DNA used in GM plants, as the work directed at bacteria will not be applicable.
Initially, a gene transfer event affects a single microbial cell. It will have no ecological impact unless the transgene confers an advantage on its recipient that causes it to become widespread in the microbial population. For most genes that may be used in GM crops, this is unlikely. A potential transgene should be assessed by first asking whether it could be expressed in microbes and could confer an advantage on them. In some cases, this may require direct testing, and high-throughput methods could be used to scan for unexpected patterns of gene activity and metabolism. If the answers are positive, then consideration must be given to the potential wider consequences if the recipients became established, so that transgenes that can be predicted to cause harm if expressed in microbes can be avoided. There is inevitably some uncertainty associated with this assessment. Our current understanding of microbial ecology does not allow us to make detailed predictions of the effect of genetic perturbations, whether these are caused by natural genetic evolution events, by normal agricultural practices, or by the spread of a novel microbe. Experience suggests that microbial community functions are fairly resilient, but a better understanding of microbial ecology is clearly desirable.
It is important to reduce the potential for expression and transfer of genetic material from GM plants to soil microbes by removal of unnecessary vector DNA that may provide homology with soil microbial DNA, origins of replication and sites for transposition, and also by introducing non bacterial features (e.g. introns) where possible.’
84

Main points made by commentators
One commentator140 thought that if soil bacteria modified by GM crops persisted, they would quite possibly persist indefinitely. It is possible that soil having once grown GM crops could never again be considered ‘GM free’. They also felt that the greatest omission of Chapter 7 was lack of consideration of the likelihood that horizontal gene flow is more likely to occur from GM crops, or any GM organisms, than from non-GM crops or organisms. This is because the transgene will have probably exploited a weak point in the host DNA to recombine, so is more likely to become detached again; it will have been engineered to recombine easily, so has been specifically designed for horizontal gene flow; it may contain parts of bacteria or virus DNA, so would be more likely to recombine with bacteria or viruses than pure plant DNA.
The Panel’s response
It is never possible to be certain that any microbe is completely absent from a complex environment such as soil. All that can be said is that it is below the lower limit of detection, which depends on the sensitivity of the method and the sampling itself, but is potentially much lower than the threshold of 0.1% currently accepted by the organic movement for GM in crops. This is as true for any GM bacteria that might arise in a GM crop as for disease- causing bacteria, for example, in a conventional or organic crop. An organism that remains below the limit of detection is unlikely to have any environmental or health effect. There is no known mechanism for the active transfer of genes from plant cells to bacteria, but free DNA derived from plants can be taken up by some bacteria. For this reason, the stability of transgenic DNA within the plant has been considered less relevant than its fate as the bacterium. This latter issue is addressed in our First Report, where it is concluded that some, but not all, transgenic DNA might be more likely to be taken up successfully by bacteria than average plant DNA.
4.5.4 CangeneticmaterialinGMplantstransfertoviruses? Summary conclusions from First Report
‘Since 1986, thousands of GM plant lines have been made that contain a range of DNA sequences of viral origin, mostly short fragments that regulate the way in which other (non- viral) transgenes are expressed. There have also been many hundreds of GM plant lines in which short viral DNA sequences have been introduced to confer resistance to viral diseases. This approach has proved to be a selective, measurable and environmentally sustainable method of crop protection. The conventional alternative is to use pesticides liberally to control the fungi and invertebrates that spread the viruses.
Several GM virus-resistant crops have been grown commercially on a large scale in several countries for at least seven years.
 140 Green Party. See Annex I.
85

Laboratory and greenhouse studies, since 1994, have shown that defective mutant viruses with a range of genetic defects can be restored to their wild type phenotype by acquiring the necessary sequence from a suitable GM host plant through recombination. Detailed studies have been carried out to look for the transfer of genetic material from GM plants to viruses under field conditions. None has been detected. These studies have involved a number of commercial GM crops, including papaya, squash and sweet potato. If such transfer did occur, the potential consequences would have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis of each virus- resistant GM variety.
Containment of any newly emerging plant virus would be through standard and widely accepted control measures. Since the 1970s, an accepted and approved practice has been to intentionally infect highly susceptible, high-value crops such as glasshouse tomatoes with a mild strain of a virus to protect them against severe strains of the same or a related virus. This practice poses greater (and documented) opportunities than GM for genetic recombination to create new virus strains.
It is theoretically possible, but extremely unlikely and without precedent, that transfer of viral genetic material from a tested and approved GM plant would make an invading virus fitter. This is because that rapid mutation, selection, genome reassortment and switching of genetic material between naturally occurring viruses are common natural events. It is therefore reasonable to assume that any new genetic trait beneficial to the virus would already have been tried and selected through millennia of evolution, or during natural or artificial mixed virus infections.
Nevertheless, several practical recommendations can be made in the design of transgenes containing DNA derived from viral sequences that would minimise the theoretical risk associated with their use.’
Main point made by commentators
One group of commentators141 were concerned about the possible risks arising from possible recombination and capsid exchange events between GM transgenes and viruses. We have dealt with comments on specific viral issues separately below.
The Panel’s overall response
Our First Report fully acknowledged laboratory-based studies in which a (more-or-less) genetically defective virus clone could be restored to a (near) wild-type phenotype by homologous RNA or DNA recombination in specially engineered GM plants that expressed an essential ‘restorer’ gene sequence. The desirability (or otherwise) of including viral replication signals in a transgene, their consequent impact on recombination frequencies, and the lack of evidence that such events happen between wild-type plant viruses and GM plants

 86

in field trials, or in commercial production, are discussed extensively in our First Report, in many reviews since the late 1980’s, and in the cited DETR Report (1999)142.
Our First Report also acknowledged a general problem that it is scientifically impossible to prove a negative (e.g. that gene flow (i.e. heritable genetic recombination) between a viral transgene sequence and a wild-type plant virus could never happen), and that negative results are intrinsically difficult to publish in peer-reviewed journals.
The occurrence and possible risks of non-homologous recombination were acknowledged in our First Report, as was the possibility of natural homologous or even non-homologous recombination (page 241, paragraph 6 and page 243, paragraph 2). But, there is no experimental evidence that such events occur in nature, or that any hypothetical risk posed is any greater in a GM plant than in any natural mixed infection of non-GM plants. Guided by the title of Section 7.5 in our First Report, the text considered all available scientific evidence for or against genetic recombination during RNA or DNA replication between mutated or native viral and transgene sequences. One consequence of such an event would be the generation (evolution) of a heritable new (recombinant viral) sequence (as screened for by Lin et al. 2003), possibly with new biological properties (as tested in Thomas et al. 1998). From both these papers, and from other research, there is as yet no a priori evidence for field-level RNA or DNA recombination between a GM plant and a wild-type virus isolate.
The commentators do not provide any new data or scientific evidence to support their assertions that recombination between any viral transgene in any GM plant and any field- isolate of a related or unrelated virus can occur, or has occurred. Equally they provide no scientific reason or evidence to support the assumption that any speculative ecological or environmental risk posed by such a theoretical recombinant virus would differ from that posed by new viruses which evolve constantly in nature, in non-GM host plants, through RNA/DNA mutation, genetic recombination, and/or genomic reassortment events during mixed infections.
Contrary to claims made by the commentators, those surveyed for the DETR Report (1999)143 did not say that recombination was ‘inevitable’, or that ‘the probability of horizontal gene transfer of transgenes is greater than for mixed infections’. Most respondents did, however, identify viral transcapsidation and RNA recombination as the most likely possible hazards of deploying GM crops with viral transgenes. This is stated clearly and openly in our First Report (Section 7.5.3, page 240, paragraph 1).
The commentators did highlight the fact that five independent naturally co-infecting viruses were recovered from a single plant (reported in Falk &amp; Bruening 1994). Indeed, mixed virus infections of wild reservoir species and field crop plants are surprisingly common in nature (see below).

The Panel’s response on some specific viral issues
The susceptibility of GM crops to viruses
Some commentators implied that our First Report report ignored one of the main risks involved in the use of plant virus-derived transgenes, namely the potential for them to make crop plants more susceptible to viruses which are related or unrelated to the virus from which the transgene came. They contended that such GM crops may be especially susceptible to new infectious viral diseases.
The Panel’s response
The First Report fully acknowledged the extensive published evidence for, and possible hazards posed by, natural virological phenomena such as transcapsidation, synergism, complementation and phenotypic mixing (pseudo-recombination) that do occur during mixed virus infections, and that may occur in GM plants expressing a particular functional virus- derived transgene. However, none of these events occur by, or result in heritable recombinant RNA or DNA. There are no reports of any GM plant becoming more susceptible to an existing or new plant virus in the field. Published data discussed in detail elsewhere in our Second Report (Lin et al. 2003; Thomas et al. 1998) and many other field studies (since 1988) on GM plants expressing viral transgenes have found no evidence of recombination under field conditions, although it is acknowledged that recombination events will be rare and therefore difficult to detect.
A 6-year long (1991-1996) field study by Thomas et al. (1998), using 65,000 potato plants from 954 GM-lines designed to express different Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) coat protein or RNA replicase transgene constructs, showed them not to be infected in the open field or the greenhouse by viruses that did not normally infect potato. Simply being GM had clearly not made the plants more vulnerable to infection by new or unrelated viruses. Nor were new viruses or viruses with altered biophysical, biochemical or biological properties detected in any case. Similar conclusions were reached from extensive field data on a range of common cucurbit-infecting viruses and GM plants collected by Lin et al. 2003 (see Section 2).
Virus transcapsidation and gene silencing
Some commentators stated that the potential for expression of viral capsid proteins to transfer viruses to new hosts by allowing them to be transported by unfamiliar vectors was only addressed briefly and inadequately (paragraph 135), and potential food safety risks, particularly of gene silencing, were also addressed briefly and inadequately (paragraph 136).
The Panel’s response
Our First Report contained extensive discussion of the natural biological phenomenon of virus transcapsidation (Section 7.5.3, paragraph 2, page 242) and actual or possible transfer by a new vector, as well as how to mitigate this phenomenon. These issues were also covered extensively in the DETR Report (1999)144 cited in our First Report.
Comments on gene silencing as ‘an extremely poorly understood mechanism’ to confer resistance to viruses conflict with the wealth of recent data on this topic (see Hannon 2002, for example). The reader is also referred to Section 2.2.8 of this report. Here we deal more extensively with the issue of silencing and the probable differences between plant and animal systems. Moreover, the commentators’ text is contradictory on whether or not gene silencing
144 Safety of plant viral inserts. Research report No. 11, DETR 1999.
   88

poses some hypothetical risk as a ‘powerful biochemical pathway’ because it is, or is not, sequence specific. The commentators provide no reason or evidence for their proposal that gene silencing, a natural process, ‘presents a risk to food safety’. Reference to SARS and HIV as evidence for natural, newly evolved viruses (with no cited references) is made, despite there being no scientific connection to the issue of gene flow between GM plants and natural plant viruses.
Evidence for recombination
Some commentators felt that the main conclusion in our First Report, that recombination has not happened in the field, put too much reliance on one study (Thomas et al. 1998). In addition, the conclusion that any new viruses would be out-competed by other viruses was not supported by the evidence. Viruses are constantly evolving and can prosper despite locally adapted competition.
The Panel’s response
Although not common, DNA or RNA recombination events do occur during natural mixed virus infections in non-GM plants, and laboratory-generated homologous recombination has been reported between a genetically engineered defective virus and a transgenic host plant expressing a suitable restorer RNA or DNA sequence. Recombination in such cases can be detected as a result of the fact that a selective pressure (selection of viable, heritable non- defective virus genomes) is applied in which only recombined molecules can compete successfully.
Since 1982, all attempts to develop DNA, and later RNA viruses as vectors to express foreign gene sequences (including sequences from related or unrelated plant viruses that could comprise a resistance transgene in a GM plant) have shown that all foreign (unselected) viral sequences pose a ‘genetic burden’ to the parent virus. Why might this be the case? All wild- type viruses (of plants, animals etc) are constantly mutating; possibly reassorting and recombining (when two viruses co-infect the same plant cell); and being tested and selected for fitness. RNA viruses are especially variable because their replication machinery is error prone and they exist as a swarm of related sequences, which teeter on the brink of error catastrophe. What we define as ‘the virus’ is the ‘optimal’ sequence which occupies a very sharp ‘fitness peak’ in the sequence landscape. This sequence is the optimal sequence of the virus that maximises replication under the selection conditions applied (species and physiology of host plants; vector species, temperature, humidity, etc.). The inherent variation in the sequence swarm allows viruses to respond rapidly to different selection conditions.
Two decades of experimental evidence support the view that any newly-engineered recombinant virus is either non-viable, or competes poorly against its wild-type progenitor strain. Often, genetic reversion of the virus population to the original wild-type sequence occurs within one (or a few) infection cycles (passages) from host-to-host, even in the laboratory or greenhouse. On the basis of this extensive experience, as well as the theoretical framework described above, which is supported by the Thomas et al. (1998) and Lin et al. (2003) papers (see Section 2), any scenario in which a new virus could result from recombination between a transgene and a virus infecting a transgenic crop, is considered to have an extremely low probability of occurrence. Mutation and recombination will very likely have already selected the most successful genetic combination, each of which we recognise today as a defined natural ‘plant virus’. However, particular attention in risk assessments should be with events that could not happen in doubly infected plants where novel
 89

recombination events may arise and which could introduce new dimensions into the dynamics of plant/virus co-evolution.145
A 6-year-long, release experiment using GM Russet Burbank potato varieties (65,000 plants from 954 independent GM lines designed to express different Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) coat protein or RNA replicase transgenes) was prompted by ‘a search for evidence of transcapsidation, complementation, synergism, or genetic recombination in virus-infected transgenic plants’ (Thomas et al. 1998). Among others, three lines of two constructs (line 82 of 18844, and lines 129 &amp; 350 of 18834; described by Thomas et al. (1998)) that contained a full-length PLRV replicase gene were then studied further, ‘selected and released for commercial production’ (Thomas et al. 2000). However, their extreme resistance to PLRV, and hence their reduced need for aphicidal sprays, have not yet been exploited commercially due to current policy decisions on GM foods by processors and retailers. The authors concluded that new viruses or viruses with altered sedimentation characteristics, symptoms, or host range were not detected in field-exposed or greenhouse-inoculated potato plants that expressed PLRV CP or replicase transgenes.
The scale, range and detail of the approaches used by Thomas et al. (1998) were adequate to detect any significant change in the particular viruses and their particular biological properties under investigation (alterations in host range and symptoms) and hence support the (albeit) negative conclusions of the paper.
Some commentators were critical about the prominence given to this study in our First Report and the sensitivity of the tests used and their relevance to measuring recombination in the field. On the first point, this study was given prominence because it gives us real world data under real large-scale conditions. The conclusions drawn are appropriate, as the authors point out in relation to sensitivity: ‘only the transgene/virus interactions that produced the specific alterations searched for in this study would have been detected in the studies reported here’; and in terms of scope, the study makes it clear that general conclusions cannot be drawn about recombination. We endorse this view, which is the case-by-case approach.
More recent published work (Lin et al. 2003) with GM squash plants that co-expressed several different plant viral coat protein genes, and using molecular tools to detect changes at the RNA level, showed that no new viruses were generated through RNA recombination. This study is described in detail in Section 2.2.10.
Further scientific studies will increase our knowledge in this important area. We identified a number of areas in our First Report (page 248), including research to compare the frequency of recombination events in natural mixed virus infections with events in a single virus- infected GM plant.
The containment of new plant virus outbreaks
Some commentators felt that Section 7.5 in our First Report implied that methods exist to control new virus outbreaks when this is true for only a handful of known viruses (paragraph 144). Even if new plant virus diseases are containable, this may take time and be at a large cost.

The Panel’s response
Phytosanitary controls exist to control existing and newly emerging plant viruses, with varying degrees of success. There is no reason to assert that these measures would be any less effective against any hypothetical, viable, new recombinant virus, however it may have been formed. There is no evidence to assume that ‘new plant viruses diseases’ would somehow be uniquely ‘uncontainable’ (take longer or cost more to control) through gene flow (recombination) any more than those which arise through natural evolutionary events (see ‘swarm theory’ and ‘viral fitness’ above).
4.6 THE GM SCIENCE REVIEW PROCESS
Our First Report was welcomed by a large number and wide range of respondents. Many of even the most critical commentators remarked that this initiative constituted a positive and potentially significant step in the context of other UK Government activities in this field. Although there was one individual who found the review a ‘pseudo-drama and massive misjudgement’, many readers appreciated the broadening and deepening of the general appraisal of GM science, linking it more closely with public concerns and questions and giving due attention to uncertainties, gaps in knowledge and divergent scientific perspectives. The Panel as a whole would strongly concur with the more widely held view.
The Panel was certainly unusually broad in its composition, both in terms of the disciplines and the perspectives on the GM issue that were represented. Given this diversity, it achieved a welcome degree of cohesiveness. Strong efforts were made to identify and build on common ground or, failing this, to document the reasons for remaining differences of view. There were comments welcoming the First Report as thorough and well-balanced.
However, concerns were raised by some commentators that, despite its relatively large size, the membership of the GM Science Review Panel was in some respects rather narrow. For instance, the relative absence of nutritionists and epidemiologists was highlighted. In looking at these comments, the Panel also discussed the point that membership did not reflect the full range of views on every subject area. Taking these comments together, the Panel noted that toxicology, rather than nutrition was more relevant to its remit, and there was a toxicologist as a member. The Panel recognised that he worked for the industry, and that they had also invited and received comments from the FSA and its expert advisory committees, which themselves have a wide range of members. The Panel observed that there are very practical limitations on the size of group that can engage in effective deliberation. It is simply not possible to include all shades of opinion from every relevant discipline. It was therefore important to put the First Report out for public comment. It was also noted that members networked outside the Panel and read the literature where points might not have been central to their expertise. Despite its large size, it is widely believed by Panel members that it operated effectively through much vigorous debate and that, overall, the size and disciplinary composition of the Panel was about right.
Concerns were also raised by a number of respondents to the effect that the Panel membership embodied a generally more favourable opinion of GM than is extant among the wider public. The Chair of the Panel, has observed that on many occasions in panel discussion it would not be possible to pinpoint the speakers’ particular viewpoint; the discussion was on the merits of the scientific evidence and that it was an objective process.
 91

A particular concern was raised by the NGOs in relation to a perceived asymmetry in the invitations to different constituencies to nominate Panel members. This seems to arise because biotechnology industry organisations were approached as a single body, whilst Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, GeneWatch and The Soil Association were approached individually. It was felt that this led to the Panel including two scientists working for industry organisations, but no scientists working for the environmental organisations named above, although their two nominees were accepted. This does suggest that there is scope for improved communications for future exercises, including enhanced provision for direct scientific dialogue with the NGO community. The Panel again, however, emphasises the range of its membership, including those working for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and English Nature.
Another criticism was over the inclusion in the Panel of members of established GM advisory committees. There was concern that critical scrutiny of existing regulatory practice might somehow be restrained. In this regard, it should be emphasised that all members of the Panel served as individuals in an entirely independent capacity. A major conclusion of the Panel was that it was imperative that regulatory expertise keeps abreast of developments in GM science.
A further concern was voiced over the process by which the drafting task was approached in the early stages, in particular that the initial draft and early editing of one section was produced by an industry nominee. The Panel believes it is important to set this observation in the overall context of the production of the final report. After initial scoping meetings of the full Panel, sub-groups met to discuss the subject matter of the four main science chapters of the report and agreed the allocation of tasks. On this basis, individuals with particular knowledge produced first drafts of sections and took account of initial comments from the whole Panel. Partly to meet concerns that there might be a perception of partial editing, but also to take account of all the discussion in sub-group and in the seven main Panel meetings, and in e-mail exchanges on detail, the Secretariat then took on responsibility for the final editing process. The entire Panel took an active role from the initial stages through to agreeing the final documentation. The Panel believes that all Panel members had the opportunity to challenge and have their views heard, that the process was robust and wishes to underline that the Panel as a whole took ownership of the final document.
In conclusion, it seems that the GM Science review process, taken in the context of the UK Government’s wider GM Dialogue, has been generally regarded as a very positive and useful exercise. This initiative provides important lessons and a positive model for any such exercise in future.

Two nucleotides, one on each of the opposite complementary strands of DNA or RNA, connected via hydrogen bonds are called a base pair. In DNA, adenine and thymine, as well as guanine and cytosine, can form a base pair. The length of a nucleic acid molecule is often given in terms of the number of base pairs it contains. Modified to kbp (kilobase pairs, often used to measure transgene sizes) and Mbp (megabase pairs, used to measure total genome sizes).
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council
A measure of the range and abundance of living organisms, this includes diversity within species and between species.
The science of managing and analysing biological data using advanced computing techniques. Especially important in analysing genomic research data. See also in silico.

Bacillus thuringiensis
Oilseed rape (used in North America). Commission for Environmental Cooperation
(or chimera) An organism made up of cells containing different genetic information.
Specialised plastid (general term for plant cell organelles which carry non-nuclear DNA) that contains chlorophyll. They are the site of solar energy transfer and some important reactions involved in starch and sugar synthesis. Chloroplasts have their own DNA genome and this is generally inherited through the female parent.
A commercial herbicide tolerant system using a group of conventionally bred crops with resistance to the broad- spectrum herbicide imidizole.
Relating to a flower that does not open and is self-pollinated in the bud.
A group of three consecutive nucleotides that represent the unit of genetic coding by specifying a particular amino acid during the synthesis of polypeptides in a cell. Each codon is recognised by a transfer RNA carrying a specific amino acid, which is incorporated into a polypeptide chain during protein synthesis.
As there are 64 possible triplet combinations of the 4 nucleotides (4x4x4) that are present in mRNA and DNA and only 20 amino acids, there is approximately a 3-fold excess of triplet combinations available to encode these amino acids. This means that codons can be changed without altering the amino acid sequence of the protein they encode. For some amino acids the codons most commonly used to encode them differ between eukaryotes (e.g. plants) and prokaryotes (e.g. bacteria). Therefore, the codons of a transgene derived from a prokaryote may be changed so that expression of the transgene in plant cells is more efficient.

Process by which progeny derive a combination of genes different from that of either parent. In higher organisms such as plants, this can occur by crossing over (breaking during meiosis of one maternal and one paternal chromosome, the exchange of corresponding sections of DNA, and the rejoining of the chromosomes). In lower organisms such as bacteria and viruses, it describes the cutting and rejoining or RNA/DNA template switching, which results in the exchange of fragments of genetic material or information between different organisms. It also describes the transfer of transgenic material between lower organisms and GM plants containing homologous sequences. Homologous recombination mediates the transfer or exchange of genetic information between homologous sections of DNA.
