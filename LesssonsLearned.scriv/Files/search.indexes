            <Text> GM food and crops: what went wrong
in the UK?
Many of the public’s concerns have little to do with science
Derek Burke
Genetically modified (GM) crops are now being grown extensively in North and South America and
China, although not in Europe. Food pro- duced from these crops has become a part of the normal diet in North and South America and in China, but not in Europe, where contention continues despite the fact that millions of US citizens eat GM soya without any ill effects in a very liti- gious society, and many Europeans have eaten GM soya while in the US without any adverse consequences.
European consumers’ continuous and ardent opposition to GM crops and foods has had serious repercussions for plant research, for the commercial develop- ment of new crops and, most importantly, for developing countries that could bene- fit most from GM crops. Several countries in Africa and elsewhere have resisted growing such crops, mainly for fear of being unable to export them to the European market (The Economist, 2002). It is therefore worthwhile to investigate what actually went wrong in the debate about GM food and crops in Europe and how these foods have earned such a bad name. Such an analysis could not only help to overcome public fears of this
technology, but also help scientists and policy makers to address similar concerns in the future, such as the growing debate over nanotechnology.
The concerns of European consumers about the potential health and envi- ronmental threats of GM crops have resulted in an unprecedented effort to investigate those anxieties and communi- cate with the wider public, particularly in the UK, where the use of public consulta- tion has been extensively developed. The first of these initiatives was the extensive Farm Scale Evaluations of three GM crops (herbicide-resistant beet, oil seed rape and maize), whose results were published last year (Firbank, 2003 and articles cited within; Turner, 2004), followed by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment’s report to the UK govern- ment (ACRE, 2004). There has also been a major review of the science relevant to GM crops and food, chaired by the Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government (GM Science Review, 2004). In addition, the UK Agricultural, Environmental and Biotechnology Commission has produced a series of reports on the scientific, social and ethical implications of sowing GM crops (www.aebc.gov.uk). The Nuffield Council on Bioethics’ paper on ‘The use of genetically modified crops in develop- ing countries’ (2004) reaffirmed its earlier conclusion that “there is an ethical oblig- ation to explore these potential benefits responsibly, in order to contribute to the reduction of poverty and to improve food security and profitable agriculture in
developing countries” (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 1999). Finally, the British Medical Association recently stated in its report ‘Genetically modified foods and health’ (BMA, 2004) that “The BMA shares the view that there is no robust evi- dence to prove that GM foods are unsafe” and that “genetically modified food has enormous potential to benefit both the developed and developing world in the long term.”
The British government has now made a decision on the basis of this mass of evi- dence. On March 9 this year, Margaret Beckett MP, UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, made a statement in the House of Commons saying inter alia that “There was no scientific case for ruling out all GM crops or products” (Beckett, 2004) and announced agreement in principle to the commercial cultivation of GM herbicide- tolerant maize, subject to some condi- tions. Beckett further said that “There is no scientific case for a blanket approval of all uses of GM, and equally there is no scien- tific case for a blanket ban on the use of GM,” although she took into account pub- lic concerns. “Most people believe that the use of genetic modification should be approached with caution. They want strong regulation and monitoring and in addition, some want a framework of rules for coexistence of GM and non-GM crops, and customers want a clear regime for traceability and labelling so that they can make their own choices.”
This was all to no avail. On March 31, Bayer CropScience (Monheim, Germany)

  announced that it was giving up attempts to commercialize its GM maize in the UK—the only transgenic plant approved for widespread cultivation (Mason, 2004). The company explained that its herbicide- tolerant maize variety Chardon LL had been left “economically non-viable” because of the conditions imposed by the Govern- ment on its growth in the UK. After the Farm Scale Evaluation trials showed that it caused less damage to wildlife than con- ventional varieties, Beckett had given the crop limited approval, but had not yet decided rules for mixing GM and non-GM crops, and for compensation for “contami- nation” by GM pollen. Bayer pointed out that Chardon LL had been developed for approval in 1999, but in the interim had lost its competitive edge against rival vari- eties as the controversy over GM crops continually slowed its introduction. It also warned that the UK’s tough regulations on GM plants could put at risk the adoption of this new technology.
Bayer’s decision to withdraw Chardon LL from the UK and other European mar- kets means that UK farmers will not grow GM crops until GM oil seed is approved for cultivation; this will not be before
2008. The moral is obvious: States that procrastinate and prevaricate over new technologies lose it. Decisions such as this will only accelerate the flight of both sci- entists and companies from the EU to countries that are more accepting of new technologies.
So, despite all these scientific activities, there is still considerable antipathy to the introduction of GM crops and food. Why has the British public, who normally so pragmatically welcome scientific advances, resisted the introduction of genetically modified crops? What went wrong in the past few years and what lessons can we learn from this experience that might be helpful elsewhere in Europe and in future debates about new technologies?
In fact, the British public has not been proactive on the GM question. It does not crop up spontaneously either in gen-
eral polls about voting issues, or in more detailed questionnaires about family and social matters. One recent consumer sur- vey (FSA Public Attitudes to GM, 2002) commented that “In normal circum- stances, GM [is] very far down the list of considerations with regard to food; [it] is a
tiny feature on the mental map of food issues, [and] does not figure at all for some”, while GM safety was not among the top ten sources of information most used when selecting food. During the ‘GM Nation? The Public Debate’ (2004), the website received interest from only 0.035% of the population and letters and emails from 0.0002% (Myram, 2004). When people were asked whether they are in favour of GM foods or planting GM crops, 36% answered “No”—with 13% supportive and 39% neither for nor against—so it might be better to describe the public as unpersuaded by the benefits (Poortinga &amp; Pidgeon 2004; Cordon, 2004). However, in another survey (Consumer Watch, 2003), only 13% of consumers said they actively avoid foods with GM ingredients, while 13% said they would welcome these products on the supermarket shelves, and 74% were not sufficiently concerned about GM food to actively avoid it. It was not seen as a priority when compared with other aspects of the purchase decision. It seems as if consumers prefer to go along with what appears to be the easiest course, which in this case is a precautionary approach. This attitude, dri- ven in part by the press, campaign groups and government equivocation, is indeed resistance, but it is important to emphasize that it is not public-led.
It is also puzzling that there has never been any public concern about the fact that, for the past 50–60 years, plant breed- ers have used chemical and radiation mutagenesis to create new varieties, involving major and quite unknown genetic modifications followed by selection of useful outcomes. So why is there so much opposition now? It is as if GM is a light- ning rod for a whole series of consumer concerns, already present but unexpressed. Let me suggest some of them.
Consumers assess risk in a different way to scientists. The technical def- inition of risk is ‘the likelihood of
adverse consequences from any hazard’, but that is not the way the public sees risk. It does not explain why some risks trigger so much more alarm, anxiety or outrage

 than others, seemingly regardless of scien- tific estimates of their seriousness. Research over many years has identified several ‘fright factors’, which affect the way the public sees risk (Bennett, 1999). People are generally more worried if they perceive a risk to be involuntary, for example, exposure to pollution, rather than voluntary, such as smoking. Risks are also seen as more serious if they are inequitably distributed, inescapable by taking personal precautions, if they arise from an unfamiliar or novel source or if they cause hidden and irreversible dam- age. Danger to small children, pregnant women or future generations also arouses particular dread, as does the possibility of certain forms of death, injury or illness. Risks are perceived to be more threatening if they damage identifiable rather than anonymous victims. Finally, public fears also increase if the issue seems to be poorly understood by science and is subject to contradictory statements from responsible sources. GM soya scored positively on many of these factors.
One explanation for conflicting views about GM is that scientists and the public work under different value systems. Scientists and technologists see novel applications from new discoveries as logi- cal and reasonable, and characterize all opposition as unreasonable: “If only they understood what we are doing, the public would agree with us.” This is often untrue. Indeed, the public’s reaction to risk is often rather different to that of scientists, and can occur as outrage (the way the public regards Monsanto), dread (as many would regard a nuclear power station explosion) and stigma (the way the public regards food irradiation).
Peter Sandman, an expert on risk com- munication at Clark University (Worcester, MA, USA) points out that the risks the experts think will cause problems are not usually the risks that upset people (www.psandman.com). He outlines four traditional responses to public fears: the conservative’s answer is that the public is stupid and irredeemably irrational on risk issues, so we must protect public health but ignore public opinion; the liberal’s
answer is that the public is educatable but ignorant, so we must explain the data bet- ter; the company’s answer is that the pub- lic is manipulated by sensational mass media or radical activist groups, so we must fight the propaganda battle better; the activist’s answer is that the public is right—the experts have been misled or bought off—so we must base public policy on public opinion.
Sandman thus suggests a new way to look at risk: experts respond to hazards, but the public responds to outrage. Experts often define risk as probability multiplied by consequences. In contrast, Sandman defines risk as hazard plus outrage. Scientists may wonder why the public responds as it does to some risk issues— and it is usually caused by outrage. It is therefore not possible to predict how the public will react to new risks by consulting only scientists and technologists; percep- tion of risk is as important as any technical assessment of a new technology.
Ethical issues also have an important role. For example, UK regulators were asked about sheep that were
genetically modified to carry the human gene for factor IX, about normal animals that contained no gene but had been part of an experiment, and about animals that contained an inactive gene or part of a gene. There were no food safety issues involved; but would consumers object to eating an animal that had been part of a scientific experiment, or an animal con- taining an inactive human gene? Was this gene just a stretch of DNA or was it special because it came from a human being? Was it even cannibalism? Would Muslims or Jews be concerned about pork genes in lamb, and vegetarians about animal genes in plants?
Public consultation revealed a variety of concerns, many of an uneasy nature, sometimes called the “yuk” factor. Some individuals were very much opposed to the idea, and none were moved by the fact that there was effectively no chance of eat- ing the original human gene; they remained concerned even if the gene was completely synthetic. The Jewish reaction in contrast was refreshingly straightfor- ward: “If it looks like a sheep, then it is a sheep.” I suggest some of these concerns stem from a deep antipathy to meddling with ‘Nature’. Prince Charles objected to “...taking into the realm of man what
rightly belongs in the realm of God.” For him and some others, genetic modifica- tion is ‘unnatural’, articulating a romantic view of nature that regards everything ‘natural’ as good and anything tampered with by humans as bad.
This argument is based on an interpre- tation of ‘natural’ as not merely a descrip- tion of the world around us, but as a value in itself. In our post-modern Western world, which has largely abandoned con- ventional religions, ‘natural’ has often become synonymous with ‘good’. The question then is why opponents to GM regard it as ‘unnatural’. Possibly, GM came to be seen as an offence to nature by those very people who promote natural- ism. However, under other circum- stances, it could have become part of the organic movement to reduce the use of chemicals in agriculture, and as such would have been seen as ‘natural’. Thus, people with pre-existing agendas projected their value judgements onto the GM debate. In contrast, few scientists see genetic modification as unnatural, but agree that some things are unethical and that not everything that is possible should be done.
The conclusive influences on the GM debate in the UK were those of the media and the non-governmental organizations (NGOs). British newspapers run campaigns in the fierce competition for circulation, readers like scare stories although they may not believe them and scientists do not understand the workings of the media; the stage was set for trouble. In fact, the media had a field day when Árpád Pusztai claimed on television on 10 August 1998, and later in a press con- ference in the UK House of Commons on 12 February 1999, that feeding rats with genetically modified potatoes caused them damage. Despite its eventual publi- cation in a peer-reviewed journal (Ewen &amp; Pusztai, 1999), the Royal Society (1999)

 stated, after a careful investigation by a peer group, that “we found no convincing evidence of adverse effects from GM potatoes.” Although Pusztai’s claim was not supported by evidence (Chen et al, 2003), the headlines of many newspapers from that period stagger the imagination (see sidebar).
This was not the only newspaper cam- paign run against GM foods and crops. Just before the results of the Farm Scale Evaluation were released on 16 October 2003, a large number of anti-GM head- lines appeared in several British newspa- pers, clearly aiming to influence public opinion. Even after the report was pub- lished, many newspapers stated the results as “the end of GM in the UK”. In fact, the trials did not assess the effects of geneti- cally modifying crops but rather the effect of different types of weed control. They had almost nothing to do with genetic modification.
In addition to the hostile attitude of many newspapers, the NGOs involved in the GM debate in the UK have proved themselves to be very skilled at presenting their position to the media. They are highly organized, have clear points of view and are well funded. They know how to ‘spin’, or change the way journalists approach a story. Their mission is not to debate facts and findings but to influence public opin- ion, and any debate with them is unlike a standard scientific debate. NGOs are not looking to find a mutually agreed solu- tion, but rather to promote a single uncom- promising message. As soon as one objec- tion is dealt with, they move on to the next, never admitting that they might be wrong. Scientists, in contrast, know that science at the cutting edge is not always able to provide clear conclusions. But that does not mean “We shall never know”, or even “It is impossible to find out.” In that sense, scientific findings are always provi- sional, but faced with the crisp, clear and often outrageous claims of NGOs, they are unimpressive in the public debate.
So, what lessons have we learned from the GM drama in the UK? First, scien- tists have to organize themselves. In
the debate following Pusztai’s claim, the scientific community was continually los- ing out, while the pressure groups released one news story after another, winning new headlines about every three days. Scientists were always on the defensive,
and often too busy to respond quickly to news stories.
Thus, a rebuttal group is invaluable. For instance, the media reaction to the Farm Scale Evaluations infuriated the sci- entific community in a way I have never seen before. As an interested but indepen- dent scientist I felt we had to respond, so I decided to write to the Prime Minister telling him of widespread demoralization in the scientific community and the dan- ger of losing new technologies, and ask- ing for an assurance that when making his decision about the future of GM, he would take the scientific evidence fully into account. I sent colleagues a draft let- ter, asking whether they would sign it, and within a few days there were 120 signa- tures from men and women working right
across the biological sciences, including a Nobel Laureate, nearly 40 Fellows of the Royal Society and several academics who had helped to start new companies. The letter was delivered to Prime Minister Tony Blair on 30 October 2003, and he replied on 7 November: “I believe that the technology has great potential in the UK [and the Government] will take decisions on the basis of scientific evidence ... and will not react to scare mongering, but will continue to build a firm evidence base.” It is important that a rebuttal group must be able to react quickly to any new develop- ments. They need to stay in constant con- tact and must be prepared to react within 24–48 hours. It is no good waiting until the weekend. Nor is it any good asking a professional society to conduct a “proper review to allay the fears of the public”. It will be too slow, too late and will not influence events.
Scientists must accept the media as it is. What can they do about it? One thing is to get some media training; many scien- tists in the UK have already done this. Another is to get involved, and that means being available at very short notice to respond to requests from radio and TV sta- tions, to have the facts at your fingertips and to be ready to be subjected to hostile, in some cases brutally hostile, question- ing. None of us in the UK have enjoyed this, but many have felt that it is absolutely necessary. Scientists also need a series of ‘good news stories’, not stories about splendid new scientific advances, but realistic, honest stories about how a new technology can benefit the public, and particularly the consumer. I believe that we also have to consider the wider impli- cations of research, recognizing that our work may have ethical implications, and that we should start thinking them through. Most scientists do not have the training, the skills or frankly the right to speak out on these issues. Instead, we need to work with social scientists, philosophers and theologians to adopt a credible stand in the public’s view. It will be an education.
Importantly, we must not adopt the strategies of NGOs, which means that we must not hype. But we also have to get the message across that change is necessary if, to take but one example, we want to feed the burgeoning world population without changes in agriculture. Without such initiatives, scientific research is

 endangered, for it is very easy now to per- suade the public that science for its own sake is risky, even dangerous, and that society does not need it.
None of this is good news. Many a sci- entist will resent the loss of time and the way in which their honest efforts for soci- ety will be twisted, and they may even face personal recrimination. But there is no other way.

  Abstract Transgenic crops have been the recipient of strong support as well as vigorously opposed opinions since their appearance. In any case, their growth throughout the world has been remarkable, and the production and commercialization of transgenics in Latin America has been especially significant. The purpose of the present study was to analyze transgenic crop production trends around the world and the relationship between the area allocated to the cultiva- tion of transgenic crops and the profits generated by this activity. Data concerning Latin American coun- tries and their participation in transgenic crop produc- tion are addressed specifically. The present study used covariance analysis, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, time series analysis, Dicker–Fuller test, Durbin–Wat- son statistic, standardization, and different measures of central tendency. Results for the period between 1996 and 2016 show that, despite the significant increase in the area planted with this type of crops,

their production presented a deterministic growth behavior, which is explained using a non-stationary model. Current data are insufficient to establish a causal relationship between cultivated hectares and their derived profits. Finally, the present study showed that production increased considerably from 2004 to 2016 in the cases of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as well as a positive relationship between the global area planted with transgenics and the corre- sponding area in these selected countries.

Introduction
Genetic modification of plants to enhance their characteristics and bring increased added value to produce began early in the history of agriculture. Genetic engineering has significantly increased the possible changes and improvements to crops; never- theless, since the introduction of genetically improved seeds, the discussion between communities in favor and against this technology has failed to move forward. Those whose opinion is favorable argue that increased production and reduced costs are ultimately beneficial to consumers. On the other hand, those who are against it are concerned about environmental and health risks (Barrows et al. 2014).

 The first account of the use of genetic engineering for commercial purposes in agriculture—an RNA- mediated gene suppression technique—dates from 1994, and it resulted in the creation of the Flavr Savr tomato. Although less money is invested on biotech- nological horticultural crops than on agronomic crops, and the economic impact of the former is still lower, relevant applications are expected in the future, and they will have to face public opinion and meet regulatory and intellectual property requisites (Chi- Ham et al. 2010; Clark et al. 2004); thus, the advancement of transgenic crops depends on how well met are various demands to guarantee its biologically safe use and the preservation of local plant species, all of which are necessary to address the concerns expressed by society.
Concerning intellectual property protection, trans- genic plant patenting schemes represent an option, but given their relevance, scientists all over the world must develop a global vision allowing for ad hoc technological management to address different related aspects, such as comprehensive protection and respon- sible transfer of such inventions, especially when the technology is transferred from developed to develop- ing economies (Koo et al. 2004; Kowalski et al. 2002). In general, the protection of intellectual property over seeds has increased significantly. In addition, market leadership is limited to a very small group of agrochemical companies, which results in high prices and insufficient capabilities to conserve these seeds among farmers (Howard 2015).
The introduction of transgenic crops into the market is always mediated by regulatory criteria, market restrictions, and compliance-associated costs (Brad- ford et al. 2005a, b). The development of biotechno- logical intellectual property and its commercialization has clearly originated in developed economies, mainly the United States, although World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries have been strong supporters of the process (Wright and Pardey 2006). As a consequence of the increasing development and consumption of transgenic crops, the discussion on their benefits and risks has intensified, particularly regarding the risks derived from inadequate manage- ment of intellectual property rights (Lo ́pez 2004). Nevertheless, given the predominance of developed countries, the introduction of transgenics in develop- ing countries must be conducted after thorough
assessments orchestrated by government actors, stake- holders, and academic peers in recipient economies.
Herring (2008) points out that, although animosity is still active around the world (genetic engineering in agriculture has not been as welcome as in other areas, for instance in medical science), several agricultural issues have already been alleviated by genetic engi- neering. Although there are still critical pending challenges (drought-resistant crops, increased produc- tivity and nutritional value, and attention to problems derived from climate change, among others), progress has been made in different countries despite contro- versy; among the most important factors blocking the introduction of transgenic crops into the market are commercial interests, problems associated with intel- lectual property, and especially political problems. Among the most critical problems identified as caused by transgenic crop development are undesired polli- nation between transgenic and conventional varieties and inadvertent planting of transgenic seeds in inten- sive crops, which entail unplanned costs for producers (Smyth et al. 2002).
Even though globally, and particularly in Europe, public opinion is reluctant to accept the production and commercialization of genetically modified crops, they have been associated with environmental and eco- nomic benefits. Most of the production is focused on a few crops with limited genetically modified charac- teristics, especially in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Canada, and Brazil, where private investments have been the vehicle for this technology to be introduced. It has also been argued that the use of noxious pesticides and herbicides has decreased significantly as a result of the increased resistance of transgenic crops. Another argument indicates that production has increased since the emergence of transgenics in number of cultivated hectares and number of countries where they are used, as well as the economic benefits derived from these activities. In addition, the new generation of transgenic crops is expected to incorporate technological upgrades and biosafety evaluation methods and to address health- related issues more extensively (increased nutritional value) (Chen and Lin 2013; Traxler 2006).
There is considerable discussion about genetic manipulation techniques and the development of transgenic crops in which biotechnology and its relationship with agriculture have been described as resulting from a neoliberal approach to food that

 imposes regulations and responds to the interests of large transnational companies; if so, governments of recipient countries have a central role in regulating biotechnology to create an adequate balance among actors. Among other issues, the discussion grapples with economic matters and legal and ethical consid- erations in which productivity becomes the central concern, and the value of transgenic crops is chal- lenged based on their social, economic, and environ- mental effects (Azadi and Ho 2010; Otero 2012). For instance, it has been argued that the commercialization of transgenic crops has been hindered by the economic burden of regulatory requirements and the barriers imposed by the market itself. Nevertheless, the field of biotechnology has acquired experience in research and commercialization activities, and its body of knowl- edge has grown; these conditions could help the industry to meet its commercialization requirements while safekeeping consumer safety (Bradford et al. 2005a, b).
In this regard, in Latin America, biotechnology firms producing food and biofuels are facing important challenges and problems in terms of food and energy safety derived from the adopted investment strategies and the incentives provided by governments and markets, which define the dynamics of the industry and its impact on society, the economy, and the environment (Saravia-Matus et al. 2018). In Latin America, the landscape of human resources training, technological and scientific infrastructure, support programs, regulation, legislation, and in general, all activities associated with biotechnology (particularly agricultural biotechnology), is markedly heteroge- neous, although the largest economies, such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Colombia, have achieved important progress (Trigo et al. 2000); therefore, mapping the configuration and evolution of the field is essential to make decisions in the sector, but especially concerning the production and com- mercialization of transgenic crops, which have a strong presence in the region. The following section demonstrates the presence of an increasing global trend, verified by its being a deterministic series and its having a sustained growth factor from 1996 to 2016. In addition, relevant data on the dynamics of transgenic crop production in certain Latin American countries are presented.
Methods
The total global area used for biotechnological transgenic crops increased from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 185.1 million hectares in 2016. This variation represents an average annual growth of 45.3 million hectares. In other words, the world has increased the territorial area allocated to transgenic produce every year between 1996 and 2016. The total worldwide variation over these 21 years was 10,788.2%. This growth has been sustained over the period and it presents a positive trend (see Fig. 1).
It is important to point out that the behavior of the total area cultivated with transgenic crops is clearly associated with time; when the covariance1 between the two variables for the period from 1996 to 2016 was calculated, the statistic indicated a result of CovðX; YÞ 1⁄4 356:7, which suggests a positive asso- ciation between the two variables. The intensity of the linear relationship was calculated for each pair of variables defined between the set of total numbers of hectares cultivated with transgenic produce (Ix) and the set defined by the years (Iu) using Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient per the following formulation:
PIxIu
q 1⁄4 qffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiqffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
 Ix Iu
P I 2x P I 2u
I 1⁄4I 􏰁I􏰂, with x xi x
Thus, the result of the statistic was qIxIu = 0.9952, which indicates a strong positive relationship of a linear nature between the global area used for planting transgenic produce and the year. Similarly, based on the calculation of qIxIu, it can be argued that the global area allocated to transgenic produce increased 99.52% for each year considered in the present study. This deterministic growth (Chandler and Scott 2011) of the global area allocated to biotechnological transgenic crops was approached using time series analysis, which demonstrated that such growth was non-stationary from 1996 to 2016. In other words, the measures of central tendency (arithmetic mean and variance) associated with the annual records are not constant over time (Shumway and Stoffer 2006;

 Leybourne et al. 2005; Fuller 1996). To verify that the series did not remain constant over time (weak stationarity)2 (Steland 2007; Rodrigues and Rubia 2008; Mirakhor and Krichene 2014; Jannati et al. 2016), we carried out Dickey–Fuller test3 for the first lag and the series tendency (Tanaka 2017; Lu et al. 2013; Guntukula 2018; Arltova ́ and Fedorova ́ 2016). The results of this test are presented in Table 1.
Results presented in Table 1 were also analyzed using Durbin–Watson statistic (D–W) = 1.978326; since the value is in the interval between dL = 1.85 and dU = 2.15, the lack of autocorrelation was vali- dated (Greene 2003). Thus, the result of augmented Dickey–Fuller test was assumed as valid: the analyzed series contains a unit root, therefore, it is non- stationary. For its part, Table 2 presents results for the proposed linear regression model, and Fig. 2 shows both estimations based on the model and real values for the global area of transgenic produce from 1996 to 2016.
2 Weak stationarity is referred to mainly because the proba- bilistic distribution associated with the series analyzed in the present study is unknown, as well as any combination of observations and all of its moments, which are time- independent.
3 Augmented Dickey-Fuller test validated the null hypothesis H0 = The series contains a unit root (series is non-stationary) over the alternative hypothesis H1 = The series does not contain a unit root (series is stationary).

Another relevant aspect to be analyzed is the cost– benefit relationship of transgenic crop production within the agricultural industry and the global value of biotechnology in the market from 1996 to 2016. Data in Fig. 3 show that each hectare used to grow transgenic crops produced an average profit of 0.07 million USD per year in the global market of crops developed using biotechnological developments dur- ing the study period. In other words, during the study period, an average of 14.86 ha produced one million USD per year on a global scale. It is also important to highlight that the behavior of these two variables was quite homogeneous throughout the period. The Pear- son’s coefficient (first order) for the correlation of the variables was calculated at 0.9904.

  measurement scales, their trends can be used to reveal which variable increased the most during the study period. To this end, data were standardized4 so that the averages of these two variables could be compared.
The standardized average global area of transgenic crops was 0.863 (Z1), and the standardized average of the global value of biotechnology (in millions of USD) in the agricultural market was 0.874 (Z2). These values allow for two assertions: (1) The net increase in both variables was indeed homogeneous, and (2) growth in both variables was positive and sustained from 1996 to 2016. However, it should be mentioned that profits derived from developments in transgenic technology

failed to present multiple dividends as expected, at least during the study period.
Despite the simultaneous increase in the global value of biotechnology (millions of USD) in the produce market and area cultivated with transgenic crops at the global scale, as observed in Fig. 2, these variables were not correlated. In other words, a larger global surface planted with transgenic crops does not necessarily lead to higher profits derived from the global value of biotechnology in the produce market.
In Table 3, the participation of some Latin Amer- ican countries in the production of transgenic crops is expressed as a percentage of global area of transgenic crops (millions of hectares) during the 1996–2016 period.
The participation of Latin American countries in transgenic cultivation, shown in Table 3, was modest during the 1996–2016 period. Brazil was the country
with the highest number of hectares planted with transgenic crops (an average of 24.94 million hectares), while Argentina grew 16.28 million hec- tares,5 Paraguay 2.77 million hectares, Uruguay 0.97 million hectares, and Mexico 0.12 million hectares. However, Argentina showed the greatest rate of growth in cultivated area allocated to transgenic crops; from 1996 to 2016, the area increased by 23,700.90%. Meanwhile, transgenic crop area increased by 1536.7% in Brazil during the 2003–2016 period, in Uruguay by 333.3% during the 2004–2016 period, and in Paraguay by 200% during the 2004–2016 period. No increase in transgenic crop area was observed for Mexico during the 2004–2016 period. These results suggest that the internal policies of some Latin American countries have been more favorable toward

  the introduction of certain transgenic crops and, as a consequence, have led to an increase in the area allocated to transgenic crops. Several measures of central tendency were calculated to understand the relationship between the behavior of global transgenic crop area and transgenic crop area per country presented in Table 3 (see Table 4).6
The covariance statistic shown in Table 4 evinces a positive relationship between the global area culti- vated with transgenic crops and the corresponding area of each selected country in Latin America.
6 The selection of Latin American countries was based on the availability of data. Information is not available for all countries or records are only available for a distinct set of years.
Additionally, these statistics show that the area planted with to transgenic crops in Brazil during the 2004–2016 period has the greatest positive linear relationship with the global area allocated to these crops. In other words, as the global area planted with transgenic crops increases, Brazil allocates a greater number of hectares for planting these crops in comparison with other countries in Latin America;
Argentina allocated the second highest number of hectares to transgenic crops, followed by Paraguay, Uruguay, and Mexico. The linear correlation between global area of transgenic crops and area allocated to transgenic crop production in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay was confirmed by Pearson correlation coefficients, which were near 1. Therefore,
 123

398
Transgenic Res (2019) 28:391–399
 an increase in the global area allocated to transgenic crops is confirmed, and the above mentioned Latin American countries will present a similar increasing trend in their number of hectares planted with transgenic crops.
Conclusions
At present, the advancement in production and commercialization of transgenic crops is still a controverted issue; therefore, awareness of its pro- gress and dynamics throughout the world, and in specific regions such as Latin America, becomes a relevant endeavor to understand its evolution in the agricultural sector. Additionally, insights into the industry may support many actors in making decisions based on an adequate contextualization and identifi- cation of the problems and necessities characteristic of each specific region or country. These foundations lead directly to the discussion of issues associated with biosafety, conservation of local plant varieties, bioethics, promotion of endogenous capacities and technologies, legislation, and regulation, among other matters.
Time series analysis results helped to elucidate why the growth in the area of land allocated to transgenic crops around the world was deterministic and non- stationary from 1996 to 2016. On the other hand, the analysis carried out to find out the cost–benefit relationship between the global area of transgenic crops and the global value of biotechnology (in millions of USD) in the market during the same period revealed that an increase in the global area planted with transgenic crops does not necessarily correspond to increased profits derived from the global value of biotechnology in the agricultural market.
Finally, in the case of Latin America, results indicate that the internal policies of some countries have been more benevolent to the introduction of transgenic crops, which was directly reflected in the increased area used for planting transgenics in some of these countries. In other words, there is enough statistical evidence to assert that the global increase in the area allocated to transgenic crop cultivation is associated with an increase in such area in some Latin American countries.

GM Science Review, 2004

By 2004, GM crops were grown extensively in North and South America,
and in China,
but not in Europe.

The British government went to great lengths to provide scientific and ethical support for growing GM crops.
However, this did not sway public opinion.

Scientists did not realize that the public views risk very differently from them.

NGOs have also been very skillful about their messaging.

The benefits of the technology were not obvious to the average consumer.

Since there was not compelling reason to support the technology,
the easiest course of action was to be precautionary.</Text>

            <Text>  Ever since the Asilomar Conference on ‘Recombinant DNA’ in February 1975, regulatory policies relating to recom- binant DNA technology have focused on the idea that this technology implies threats to human health and the environment [1]. As a consequence, the explicit goal of these policies is to protect society and nature from an assumed hazard, or, if protection is not possible, at least to delay the imple- mentation of the technology until scientific evidence shows it to be harmless. These pol- icies were widely accepted at the time, as public concerns were, and still are, impor- tant. As time has gone by, the evidence for negative impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops has become weaker. However, the regulatory policies within the EU are still rigid enough to prevent most GM crops from leaving the confined laboratory set- ting; should some candidate occasionally overcome the hurdles posed by these poli- cies, the precautionary principle is invoked in order to ensure further delaying in its use in the field. The reason for this over-cautious approach is widespread public resistance to GM crops, caused and amplified by inter- ested groups that are opposed to the tech- nology and invest heavily into lobbying against it.
As time has gone by, the evidence for negative impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops has become weaker
Against this background of political resistance, it is no surprise that the risks, costs and potential disadvantages of not growing GM crops have received little or no attention. These disadvantages become increasingly relevant as the scientific argu- ments for the prevailing resistance to GM
crops become weaker. Twenty-five years of risk research on GM crops have established beyond reasonable doubt that biotechnol- ogy is not per se riskier than conventional plant breeding technologies [2]. The whole seemingly endless discussion about pur- ported risks of GM crops is akin to the famous Monty Python sketch in which John Cleese is trying to return a dead parrot to shopkeeper Michael Palin, who, despite the evidence, insists that the bird is well, alive and “pining for the fjords”. Instead, we need to highlight the opportunities missed by not accepting GM crops. These include lost rev- enues for farmers, breeding companies and consumers, brain drain and lost technology innovations, reduced agricultural product- ivity and sustainability, foregone health ben- efits, especially reducing malnutrition, and many more realized or expected virtues of GM crops [3].
intended for human food and animal feed. Any party seeking approval for an edible GM crop must provide extensive scientific documentation that demonstrates that the food or feed derived thereof has no adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment, does not mislead the con- sumer, or does not differ from the food it is intended to replace to such an extent that its normal consumption would be nutritionally disadvantageous for the consumer.
In a report from 2010,
the EC [...]concluded that biotechnology is not per se riskier than conventional plant breeding technologies
The risk assessment is conducted and compiled by the applicant, and is evalu- ated by the GMO Panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The opinion ofthepanelshouldformthescientificbasis when member states provide other legiti- mate arguments and cast their votes in the Standing Committee for Food and Animal Health of the European Commission. Thus, the decision to approve a particular GMO should be on the basis of scientific grounds. By the same logic, one might take for granted that only GMOs that have been shown to have adverse effects on animal or human health or the environment will not receive approval. In practice, however, the decision whether or not to approve a par- ticular GMO is not solely a scientific issue. Several member states vote, in principle, against approval, irrespective of the sci- entific opinion delivered by the EFSA [5]. In recognition of this dead-lock, the European Commission (EC) has suggested that individual member states should have

tionally accepted guidelines, developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (www.fao.org). One leading principle is the concept of substantial equivalence, which stipulates that any new GM variety should be assessed for its safety by compar- ing it with an equivalent, conventionally bred variety that has an established his- tory of safe use [4]. Despite the fact that the Codex Alimentarius guidelines are glob- ally endorsed, the authorization procedure for GMOs differs substantially between national jurisdictions. Europe stands out as being considerably more restrictive than countries in North and South America and parts of Asia, for example. Within the European Union (EU), a common regula- tory legal framework such as Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003, governs GM crops

 the right to restrict cultivation of a given GM crop even if there are no scientifically established risks, that is, to adopt restric- tions on the basis of socio-economical or ethical grounds [6].
... it is time to look at the other side of the equation and gauge the possible benefits of adopting and growing GM crops
In addition to the scientific documenta- tion provided by the applicants who seek approval of a GM crop, public research has investigated the risks of GMOs during the past 15 years. The Directorate-General Research under the EC has spent €200 million during the past decade on such research, and several member states have initiated national research programmes specifically targeting the potential impact of the very same crops and traits that are in the European approval system [2]. A col- laborative working group under the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR) has estimated that the funds allocated to national risk research on GMOs in 13 European countries amount to at least €120 million during the past eight years (http://bmg.gv.at/home/Schwerpunkte/ Gentechnik/Fachinformation_Allgemeines/ SCAR_Collaborative_Working_Group _Risk_Research_on_GMOs).
In a report from 2010, the EC summarized the results of 130 research projects involv- ing more than 500 independent research groups and concluded that biotechnology is not per se riskier than conventional plant breeding technologies [2]. Further support for this position comes from the UK Farm-Scale Evaluation (FSE), which studied the potential impact of herbicide-tolerant crops on farm- land biodiversity [7]. One insight from the study is that overall changes in agricultural management determine the impact of a crop on biodiversity, rather than the technology or breeding behind the crop itself [8]. Between 2008 and 2009, the EFSA GMO panel evaluated a renewal to permit the con- tinued import, processing and cultivation of maize variety MON810 for food and feed. MON810 expresses the Cry1Ab pro- tein from the soil-borne bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which confers resistance to the European corn borer, and is one of two GM crops approved for cultivation in Europe; it was first approved in 1998. As a
basis for its 2009 opinion, the EFSA GMO Panel summarized 48 peer-reviewed papers on the potential risks of MON810 on animal and human health and the environment, in addition to the documentation provided by the company [9]. It found no adverse effects and concluded that MON810 is compar- able with its conventionally bred parental lines. The only difference reported was that MON810 has an increased variability in lignin content, in some studies it has been found to be higher and in some studies lower. Similarly, a review by Icoz &amp; Stotzky [10] of studies on the effects of insect-resistant Bt crops on soil ecosystems found no notable detrimental effects on microbes and other organisms in below-ground soil ecosystems. Accordingly, the authors concluded that “...available funding would be better spent on studies of the potential risks associated with the release of trans- genic plants genetically engineered to express pharmaceutical and industrial prod- ucts that, in contrast to Cry proteins, are tar- geted primarily to human beings and other higher eukaryotic organisms.”
on seeds would increase from €180 to €210 per hectare, but the cost of herbicides would decrease from €180 to €55. Taken together, the cost of input goods would decrease by 27%.
Analysis of the sugar beet shows that the economic value to producers and, by extension, to society is strategically depend- ent on two factors: the cost of keeping GM sugar separate from conventional sugar, and the public acceptance of GM sugar. The cru- cial limit was found to be a separation cost of 25% of the price; at this limit, the economic value to society vanishes even if all consum- ers buy GM products—if public acceptance is 100%. In a realistic scenario the separa- tion cost is 10% of the price and the public acceptance is 25% of the consumers. Thus, the economic benefit would be €1.3 mil- lion, or 2% of the total value of sugar beet production. If GM crops enjoyed full public acceptance, and if there were accordingly no costs of separation, the economic gain to society would amount to €10 million; about 14% of the total value of sugar beet production. Approximately 3,000 hectares of arable land—8% of the acreage of sugar beet—would be available for other uses.
... not adopting modern breeding tools—including biotechnology— will probably hamper the European agricultural systems facing a warmer and more variable climate
Similar values apply for potato and can- ola, so introducing these three GM crops in Sweden would yield an economic value of €30 million annually. In addition, producers would regain 10,000 hectares (ha) of ara- ble land; using official statistics on leasing costs for arable land in Sweden, this has an annual value of approximately €2 million. This adds up to a combined annual value to society of €32 million. The accumulated value of this annual revenue over many years—the so-called capitalized value—is €1–€1.6 billion at an interest rate of 2–3%. The annual gain amounts to approximately 14, 11 and 5% of the production value for sugar beet, canola and potato, respectively. EU-wide, a shift to these three GM crops would yield a gain of €2 billion annually, and would save 645,000 ha, which corre- sponds to a capitalized value in the range of €80–€120 billion.

 environment than conventionally bred varie- ties, it is time to look at the other side of the equation and gauge the possible benefits of adopting and growing GM crops. To that end, Fagerström &amp; Wibe [11] analysed the poten- tial economic consequences for Sweden of farmers not growing GM crops—herbicide- tolerant sugar beet and canola, and late blight-resistant potato—and then extended the analysis to all of the EU. They considered two rough categories of impact: effects that could be evaluated by studying market prices that show impacts for producers on work- force and capital, and demand for fertilizers, pesticides and fuel, and factors related to the cost of keeping GM crops separated from conventionally or organically grown crops during cultivation, harvest, transport, storage and processing. The latter cost arises from the European attitude of regarding GM crops and products as contaminants—as if we were dealing with toxic substances.
In 2008, Sweden produced almost 2 million tons of sugar beet grown on approximately 37,000 hectares and with a production value of €70 million. The authors calculated that a shift to herbicide- tolerant sugar beet could have led to a 5–10% increase in yield. Expenditure

  These calculations presuppose full public acceptance of GM crops; that is, a world in which consumers per- ceive GM crops as equal to or better than non-GM varieties. In addition, the results rest on the assumption that the benefits to the environment such as decreased use of pesticides can be measured by the cost of the pesticides. Presumably, this is an under- estimate of the environmental benefits, and the societal value is therefore probably greater than the figures presented above.
Other studies address the problem of missed economic benefits, often using economic models similar to those used by Fagerström &amp; Wibe [11]. Generally, they confirm the results discussed above: the magnitudes of the unrealized benefits are similar. Matin Qaim, an agricultural econ- omist at Göttingen University, Germany, for example, presented figures for Bt cot- ton adoption that would entail global wel- fare gains in the range of €0.5–€1.0 billion per year [12]. The biggest impact occurs in China, but India, where the relevant tech- nology was more recently commercialized, has been catching up rapidly. It is estimated
that the widespread adoption of Bt cotton in India and other countries of South Asia will result in further regional welfare gains on the order of €1 billion per year.
The benefits of adopting GM oilseeds and maize are amplified by the larger inter- national markets on which they are traded. While the annual global welfare gains at the present moderate level of adoption are esti- mated at €3.5 billion [13], this figure could reach approximately €7.5 billion with wide- spread international adoption of herbicide- tolerance and insect-resistant crops [12]. However, it is also noted that a ban on pro- duction and imports by the EU could reduce these global gains by two-thirds owing to unrealized benefits for domestic consumers and the far-reaching influence of EU policies on international trade flows and production decisions in other regions.
Large global welfare gains are projected for GM rice as well. Assuming that there is moderate adoption of GM rice in rice- producing regions, the combined global welfare gains are estimated to be in the region of €5 billion per year for Bt-carrying, herbicide-resistant and drought-tolerant
rice varieties, with India and China gaining the most. Projected welfare gains in China alone could reach more than €3 billion when first-generation GM rice technologies are widely adopted. Both studies [11,12] highlight that available analyses probably provide lower estimates of the global wel- fare effects of GM crops, because other environmental and health benefits have not been properly quantified.

griculture is blamed frequently for biodiversity loss. Several recent stud-
design of the agricultural landscape, with refuges for non-crop species, intercrop- ping and crop rotation, can counterbalance the effects of an intensified agriculture sys- tem [14]. Hence, one of the most important consequences of better yields from herbi- cide and pest-resistant GM crops in Europe would be that the surplus land could be used for refuges to promote biodiversity in the farming landscape and save natural forests from deforestation or wetlands from being drained to make way for farmland. However, regulations regarding cultivation

 distances, as well as other measures to keep GM crops separate from conventionally bred varieties, lock GM crops into large- scale agricultural practices and, in effect, prevent intercropping. Thus, the principle of non-coexistence limits the scope for farmers to take full advantage of the benefits of pre- sent and future GM crops to further reduce the need for pesticides and increase the productivity of farmland. This line of rea- soning is supported by a recent study show- ing that the willingness of farmers to adopt GM crops is substantially hampered by the costs and uncertainties associated with coexistence regulations, despite lower costs for chemicals [15].
Historically, cereal crop varieties have been replaced by new varieties on average every 5–10 years [16]. The reasons for this turnover vary, but one under- lying drive for crop replacement is the rapid loss of resistance traits. In order to maintain yield levels, farmers must either increase their use of chemicals to kill pests, or change to a new crop variety; hence the continu- ousbreedingforresistancetraits.Imminent climate changes will put further constraints on agricultural production, including an increasing need for faster and more effi- cient plant breeding to adapt crops to more variable local conditions [17]. If breeders fail in this regard, agro-chemical use will increase and Europe will become more dependent on imports. In Europe, the spatial variation in rainfall is expected to increase: Northern Europe can expect a more humid climate, which will constrain crop produc- tion owing to the increased severity of biotic stresses such as insect pests, fungal patho- gens and the invasion of alien, noxious spe- cies, whereas crop production in southern Europe will have to be adapted to drier con- ditions [18,19]. Thus, not adopting modern breeding tools—including biotechnology— will probably hamper the European agri- cultural systems facing a warmer and more variable climate [20].
Legislation that determines what consti- tutes a GMO was ratified in 2001. In a legal sense, a GMO is defined as an organism in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating or natural recombination, and refers to both plants and animals, except humans. In practice, a GMO is defined by an adden- dum to the Directive 2001/18EC, which lists the techniques that give rise to a GMO. Since the Directive 2001/18EC was ratified,
ten years have passed, and technology has progressed further. Many of the techniques listed in the addendum have been improved or are obsolete. A recent report to the EC by the Joint Research Centre [21] describes new methods, their possible applications for plant breeding and potential implications for agriculture. One common aspect of the new techniques is that many involve the use of recombinant DNA or RNA molecules in one phase of the breeding process; however, these recombinant molecules are not pre- sent in the final product and are commonly not transmitted to the next generation.
... the burden of EU legislation for GM technologies is completely out of proportion compared with other science-based endeavours
Interestingly, European scientists at public and private institutions are at the forefront of technological development concerning new breeding. In this respect the situation is similar to the history of plant transformation technologies first devel- oped at European universities [22], but now mainly used outside Europe [23]. By way of illustration, BASF, the company that developed the Amflora potato, announced recently that it is halting research on GM crops in Europe. Ultimately, the develop- ment and success of scientific know-how and new technology in Europe, as well as the adoption of new techniques and crops, will depend on the decisions made by European legislators who are discussing GM technologies and their ratification.
As a comparison, other genetically engineered products, such as biopharma- ceuticals, are approved for humans and food-producing animals after ordinary science-based safety assessments [23], without the ideological stigmatization and biased decision-making processes seen for GM crops.
USA, Canada or Brazil (27 months) [24]. In addition, these European approval times are only valid for importing commodities; approvals for cultivation in Europe take substantially longer. It took 14 years for the Amflora potato, for example, which is only the second GM crop to be approved in Europe. Not only are rules more restrictive in Europe, but only the largest companies in the seed and plant breeding business have the financial capacity to go through the lengthy and costly procedure required for approving a GM crop variety. This hampers small and medium business and prevents business spin-offs from plant research.
Second, research priorities in regard to the environmental impacts of agriculture are not directed in a productive way; risk research in Europe is not helping to develop sustainable agriculture for the future. The paradigm that stipulates that biotechnology is inherently risky, and singles out one plant breeding technology as the basis for risk research, is putting a massive regulatory bur- den on a technology that could enhance sus- tainability. As a consequence, any future risk researchonGMOsinEuropeshouldaddress the costs of this burden and the risks of not using biotechnology. We conclude that the research programmes set up in the EU to address the potential risks of GM crops are no longer scientifically motivated inquiries. The scientific community has already settled the relevant questions regarding potential risks associated with GM crops approved under legislation; what is going on is a politi- cal game. In this game, the so-called precau- tionary principle is used, in absurdum, to delay any launch of a GM crop far beyond the limit of reasonable scientific doubts.
Third, it is time to acknowledge the dis- tinct imbalance with respect to the costs and benefits of GM crops: lobbyists who benefit from demonizing GM crops are not the ones who have to carry the costs. Hence, it is not the hyped risks of GM crops that are a problem in the EU, it is the sub- missive attitude of politicians and policy- makers towards organizations who insist that GM crops are risky. It is then ordinary consumers who pay the costs and do not receive the benefits. This submissiveness manifests in the prevailing policy that GM products should be kept separate from non- GM products, as well as the incessant calls for regulations about labelling and tracea- bility. As shown above, the potential benefit to the European economy from adopting GM crops is substantial. But these potential

Risk research on GM crops in Europe has to come to an end, as do futile battles about disasters that will not happen. A dead par- rot is a dead parrot, both in Monty Python sketches and in science. The way to sustain- able and productive agriculture is not by maintaining expensive, parallel production systems, using different sets of crop varie- ties, and relying on expensive regulations for their coexistence. Instead, agricultural systems should use the best available tech- nology at all stages, including plant breed- ing. It is clear that the approval and decision process within the EU for GM crops is not science-based. The risk assessment and approval process, where the outcome is dominated by the opinions of a few self- interested stakeholder organizations with special interests is unique. It is alarming that decision-making bodies kow-tow to this non-science-based paradigm.

ISAAA Brief 54-2018: Executive Summary
Biotech Crops Continue to Help Meet the Challenges of Increased Population and Climate Change
Introduction
Biotechnology can be used to develop stress-tolerant and more nutritious crop varieties to protect natural resources and human health. Each biotech crop is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, while approved commercial products in the market have been subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny. Biotech crops should be considered as a tool for improving crop yields, has unblemished record of food safety, and obtain larger income for food-insecure farmers. These economic benefits, health improvement, and social gains obtained through biotech crop adoption should be made known to the global community so that farmers and consumers can make informed choices on what crops to grow and consume, respectively; to the policy makers and regulators to craft enabling biosafety guidelines for commercialization and adoption of biotech crops; and to the science communicators and the media to facilitate dissemination of the benefits and potentials of the technology.

The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications strongly supports the above and the scientific truths underpinning them with the publication of Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2018 (Brief 54). This publication documents the latest information on the subject, the global database on the adoption and distribution of biotech crops since the first year of commercialization in 1996, country situations and future prospects of the technology in the world. Termed as ISAAA Briefs, the annual reports from 1997 to 2015 were authored by Dr. Clive James, and the 1996 report was co-authored with Dr. Anatole Krattiger.

ISAAA dedicates this Brief to Dr. Clive James, Founder and Emeritus Chair of ISAAA, who has painstakingly authored the 20 Annual Reports making it the most credible source of information on biotech crops in the last two decades. We also dedicate this Brief to the late Dr. Randy A. Hautea, former ISAAA Global Coordinator and SEAsiaCenter Director for more than two decades. They have been great advocates of biotechnology and biotech products and believe that ISAAA can make a difference in enhancing the knowledge and capacities of the global community in order to benefit from the technology, especially the poor and marginalized people of the world.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 2018 ADOPTION OF BIOTECH CROPS
High adoption of biotech crops continued in 2018 with 191.7 million hectares worldwide.
On the 23rd year of commercialization of biotech/GM crops in 2018, 26 countries grew 191.7 million hectares of biotech crops – an increase of 1.9 million hectares (4.7 million acres) or 1% from 189.8 million hectares in 2017. Except for the 2015 adoption, this is the 22nd series of increases every single year; and notably 12 of the 18 years with double-digit growth rates.

The adoption rates of the top five biotech crop-growing countries reached close to saturation.
The average biotech crop adoption rate in the top five biotech crop-growing countries increased in 2018 to reach close to saturation, with USA at 93.3% (average for soybeans, maize, and canola adoption), Brazil (93%), Argentina (~100%), Canada (92.5%), and India (95%). Expansion of biotech crop areas in these countries would be through immediate approval and commercialization of new biotech crops and traits to target problems related to climate change and the emergence of new pests and diseases.



Biotech crops increased ~113-fold from 1996 with accumulated biotech area at 2.5 billion hectares; thus, biotechnology is the fastest adopted crop technology in the world.
Global area of biotech crops has increased ~113-fold from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 191.7 million hectares in 2018 – this makes biotech crops the fastest adopted crop technology in recent times. An accumulated 2.5 billion hectares or 6.3 billion acres were achieved in 23 years (1996-2018) of biotech crop commercialization.

A total of 70 countries adopted biotech crops – 26 countries planted and 44 additional countries imported.
The 191.7 million hectares of biotech crops were grown by 26 countries – 21 developing and 5 industrial countries. Developing countries grew 54% of the global biotech crop area compared to 46% for industrial countries. An additional 44 countries (18 plus 26 EU countries) imported biotech crops for food, feed, and processing. Thus, a total of 70 countries in total have adopted biotech crops.

Biotech crops provided more diverse offerings to consumers in 2018.
Biotech crops have expanded beyond the big four (maize, soybeans, cotton, and canola) to give more choices for many of the world's consumers and food producers. These biotech crops include alfalfa, sugar beets, papaya, squash, eggplant, potatoes, and apples, all of which are already in the market. Two generations of Innate® potatoes with non-bruising, non-browning, reduced acrylamide, and late blight resistant traits as well as non-browning Arctic® apples were already planted in the USA. Brazil planted the first insect resistant (IR) sugarcane; Indonesia, the first drought tolerant sugarcane; and Australia planted the first high oleic acid safflower for R&amp;amp;D and seed propagation. Various trait combinations were also approved including high oleic acid canola, isoxaflutole herbicide tolerant (HT) cotton, stacked herbicide tolerant and high oleic acid soybean, HT and salt tolerant soybean, IR sugarcane, and biotech maize with various IR/HT combinations in stack. Additionally, biotech crop research conducted by public sector institutions include rice, banana, potatoes, wheat, chickpea, pigeon pea, and mustard with various economically-important and nutritional quality traits beneficial to food producers and consumers in developing countries.

Biotech soybeans covered 50% of global biotech crop area.
The four major biotech crops -- soybeans, maize, cotton, and canola -- in decreasing area, were the most adopted biotech crops by 26 countries. Soybeans lead at 95.9 million hectares at 50% of the global biotech crop adoption, a 2% increase from 2017. This is followed by maize (58.9 million hectares), cotton (24.9 million hectares), and canola (10.1 million hectares). Based on the 2017 FAO global crop area for individual crops, 78% of soybeans, 76% of cotton, 30% of maize, and 29% of canola were biotech crops in 2018.

The area planted to biotech crops with stacked traits increased by 4% and occupied 42% of the global biotech crop area.
Stacked traits with insect resistance and herbicide tolerance increased by 4% and covered 42% of the global area, a testimony to farmers' adherence to smart agriculture with no till and reduced insecticide use. Herbicide tolerance in soybeans, canola, maize, alfalfa, and cotton has consistently been the dominant trait, which in 2018 covered 46% of the global area – a decrease of 1% compared to 2017.

The top five countries (USA, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India) planted 91% of the global biotech crop area of 191.7 million hectares.
The USA led the biotech crop planting in 2018 at 75 million hectares, followed by Brazil (51.3 million hectares), Argentina (23.9 million hectare), Canada (12.7 million hectares), and India (11.6 million hectares) (Table 1) for a total of 174.5 million hectares, representing 91% of the global area. Thus, biotechnology benefitted more than 1.95 billion people in the five countries or 26% of the current world population of 7.7 billion.

Figure 1. Global Map of Biotech Crop Countries and Mega-Countries in 2018

The US reached an average 93% adoption rate for plantings of biotech soybeans, maize, and cotton
In 2018, the biotech area planted in the USA was 75 million hectares, covering 39% of the global biotech area, with an average adoption rate of 93%. The biotech crops planted were soybeans (34.08 million hectares), maize (33.17 million hectares), cotton (5.06 million hectares), canola (900,000 hectares), sugar beets (491,000 hectares), alfalfa (1.26 million hectares), and some 1,000 hectares of papaya, squash, potatoes, and apples. Weather patterns in the beginning of spring 2018 characterized by cold April to warm May, oversupply of water in some parts in California, and some drought in the southwestern and south central USA contributed to reduced yield. Strong support by the US government on biotechnology calls for streamlining of regulations that have blocked cutting edge technology, setting free the farmers to innovate, thrive, and grow. The average biotech adoption rate of 93.3% from the three major crops: maize, soybeans, and cotton may mean minimal increases expected in the coming years. Thus, expansion in biotech crop area will rely on other biotech crops: canola, alfalfa, sugar beets, potatoes, and apples. The US leads the bandwagon in the discovery, development, and commercialization of biotech crops. The US government’s strong support to biotechnology and the commitment of the U.S. Food and drug Administration (US FDA) to modernize the coordinated framework to regulate biotech products reflect the country’s leadership in acceptance and recognition of the scientific basis of the technology. Expeditious approval of new products of agri-biotechnology benefits not only the USA, but also the global community. In 2018, new food/feed and processing approvals include the Chinese insect resistant rice and IRRI’s Golden Rice. New generation of HT cotton, high oleic acid canola, and low gossypol cotton were approved for environmental release.

Brazil expanded biotech crop area to reach 51.3 million hectares
Brazil planted the second largest area of biotech crops globally in 2018 at 51.3 million hectares compared to 50.2 million hectares in 2017, a 2% increase (1 million hectares), and represents 27% of the global biotech area of 191.7 million hectares. The biotech crops planted in the country include soybeans at 34.86 million hectares, maize (summer and winter) at 15.38 million hectares, cotton at 1.0 million hectares, and 400 hectares sugarcane, which was planted for the first time in Brazil. The total planted area of these three crops in Brazil was 54.88 million hectares, a 1% increase from 53.39 million hectares in 2017. The 51.3 million hectares biotech crop area is a 93% adoption rate, a 1% reduction from 2017. The area grown to biotech soybeans and cotton increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017 due to profitability, higher prices, high market demand both domestically and internationally, and available seed technologies. China was the main export market for soybeans and cotton. In 2018, 80% of Brazil soybean exports were sent to China, estimated to have hit a record of 83 million tonnes total. The availability of subsidized credit for farmers and foreign investments from large agricultural companies has supported the widespread adoption of biotech crops in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the Brazilian court has issued a ruling that lifts the ban on glyphosate in the country. The decision ensures growers’ continued access to glyphosate-based herbicides. A 20-year study of biotech crop cultivation in Brazil indicated an immense reduction in the application of pesticides per hectare and fewer losses caused by pests. Consequently, the productivity and yield of biotech crops have been, on average, higher than conventional crops.

Argentina reached close to 100% adoption rate of biotech crops
Argentina ranked third in the top 10 countries that planted biotech crops in 2018, with a total of 23.9 million hectares, 12% of the global total of 191.7 million hectares and close to 100% adoption rate. The biotech crop area was comprised of 18 million hectares soybeans, 5.5 million hectares maize, and 370,000 hectares cotton. The 23.9 million hectares is an increase of 309,540 hectares or 1.3% from 23.6 million hectares planted in 2017. Severe drought during the peak summer months reduced the area planted to biotech soybeans and resulted to importation of US soybeans to Argentina for the first time in decades. Soybean stacked trait Intacta™ introduced to farmers in 2015 was launched on 70,000 hectares, increased by 40.2% from 2017 (3.08 million hectares) – an indication of farmers adopting a technology that reduces costs and increases profits. The total maize area in 2018 increased by 5.6% from 5.4 million hectares in 2017 to 5.7 million hectares, and total cotton area in Argentina increased by 60% from 250,000 hectares in 2017 to 400,000 in 2018. After the previous years’ low approval, the Argentinian government through the Argentine National Advisory Committee on Agricultural Biotechnology (CONABIA) approved eight biotech crop applications in 2018: seven full approvals comprised of four maize IR/HT stacked events, two HT soybeans, and alfalfa event, plus one soybean event for food, feed, and processing only.

Canada reached 92.5% adoption rate
Canada planted a total of 12.75 million hectares of six biotech crops in 2018, a ~3% decrease from 13.11 million hectares in 2017. This was 7% of the global biotech crop area and was comprised of 2.4 million hectares soybeans, 1.6 million hectares maize, 8.7 million hectares canola, 15,000 hectares sugar beets, 4,000 hectares alfalfa, and 65 hectares potatoes. The slight decrease in biotech area was due to reduction in planted areas of soybeans, maize and canola. Other biotech crops, including alfalfa, sugar beets, and potatoes, planted in smaller area, increased slightly in 2018. However, the average adoption rate of 92.5% was an increase of 2% from 2017. Several approvals were given by the government of Canada. Three varieties of biotech apples (Arctic® Golden Delicious, Arctic® Granny Smith, and Arctic® Fuji) were approved for commercial planting purposes, livestock feed, and food use. Biotech Golden Rice with provitamin A Event GR2E received approval from Health Canada. This decision coincides with the approval from Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) in 2018. Health Canada also approved the insect resistant sugarcane and decided that the sugar produced was as safe as the produce from conventional sugarcane. Also in 2018, 7 tonnes of biotech salmon fillet were sold by US-based AquaBounty Technologies in Canada.

India: IR (Bt) cotton adoption increased to 95%
In 2017-18, the adoption of officially approved IR cotton represents 95% of 12.24 million hectares of cotton planted in India. Due to the successful control of the spread of unapproved IR(Bt)/HT cotton, India achieved higher planting of officially approved IR cotton to 11.6 million hectares in 2018-19, an increase of 200,000 hectares over 2017-18 and planted by over 6 million farmers. Adoption rate went down to 93% in 2017 after an all-time high of 96% in 2016 when unapproved IR/HT cotton estimated at 3.5 million packets were planted over approximately 760,000 hectares. Thus, attaining 95% adoption rate again and 6% biotech crop area indicate the restoration of farmers’ confidence on the Bt cotton technology and a sign of demand for the approval of next generation biotech cotton technology including stacked IR/HT cotton. The nationwide management of pink bollworm campaign, which was implemented in cotton growing States, focused on dryland farmers in Maharashtra in 2018. The campaign included farmers educational programs, workshops, and awareness and training programs involving key stakeholders. This contributed to increasing farmer awareness resulting in significant control of pink bollworm in the 2018 Kharif season. However, reports from different maize growing States of India indicated the devastating infestation of fall armyworm on maize, causing heavy damages in both Kharif and Rabi seasons. Activities to raise awareness on the control of fall armyworm is in full swing which could push IR maize planting in India.

Ten countries in Latin America grew 81.93 million hectares of biotech crops
Ten countries in Latin America planted biotech crops in 2018 including Brazil (51.3 million hectares), Argentina (23.9 million hectares), Paraguay (3.8 million hectares), Uruguay (1.3 million hectares), Bolivia (1.3 million hectares), Mexico (218,000 hectares), Colombia (88,000 hectares), Honduras (35,500 hectares), Chile (10,454 hectares), and Costa Rica (139 hectares) for a total of 81.93 million hectares, an increase of 2.4% from 79.4 million hectares in 2017. Latin America covered 42.7% of the global biotech area of 191.7 million hectares in 2018. Increases in absolute number of hectares and percent area were recorded in several countries, led by Brazil at 1.1 million hectares (2%), Paraguay (800,000 hectares, 27%), Argentina (300,000 hectares, 1%), Uruguay (200,000 hectares, 18%), Mexico (100,000 hectares, 100%), and a small increase of 4,000 hectares (10%) in Honduras. The increase in biotech crop area in most of the Latin American countries compensated for the losses from the extensive drought in 2017. In addition, profitability, elevated prices, high market demand in local and international market, and available seed technologies for soybeans and cotton; available subsidized credit for farmers and foreign investments from the industry; favorable weather and improved agronomic practices with efficient fertilizer applications encouraged farmers in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Honduras to plant biotech crops. In Mexico, the 100% increase in cotton area was due to farmers’ return to maize planting after a year of crop rotation as well as the favorable climate for planting and price of cotton.

The prospect for future expansion of biotech area in Latin America looks positive as more technologies come with different crops and traits. In Brazil, IR sugarcane has been planted in 400 hectares for the first time. In Argentina, the government approved the HT and low lignin alfalfa for commercialization (the third approval in the world after the USA and Canada), and approved the field trials of drought tolerant wheat and soybeans, new generation HT soybeans, and non-browning apples. The other Latin American countries may follow Brazil and Argentina as they enhance their capacity and increase awareness on biotechnology.

Nine countries in Asia and the Pacific grew 19.13 million hectares of biotech crops
Biotech countries in the Asia and Pacific region were led by India with the largest area of biotech crops at 11.6 million hectares cotton, followed by China (2.9 million hectares cotton and papaya), Pakistan (2.8 million hectares cotton), Australia (793,000 hectares cotton and canola), Philippines (630,000 hectares maize), Myanmar (310,000 hectares cotton), Vietnam (49,000 hectares maize), Bangladesh (2,975 hectares eggplant), and a returning biotech crop country, Indonesia (1,342.59 hectares drought tolerant sugarcane). This region planted 19.13 million hectares (the same as 2017) of biotech crops, 10% of the global biotech crop area of 191.7 million hectares.

Increases in biotech area were obtained in India (200,000 hectares, at 2%), China (100,000 hectares, 4%), Vietnam (4,000 hectares, 9%), and Bangladesh (575 hectares, 24%). The favorable global cotton price has positively impacted biotech cotton adoption in India and China, while public acceptance of clean and hazard free production of biotech eggplant motivated more farmers in Bangladesh. In Vietnam, the low price of imported maize and overall production trend of switching from maize to other higher value crops has minimally increased biotech maize area. 

However, this area expansion of biotech crops was made almost even by the decrease in biotech crop areas in Pakistan (decrease of 200,000, at -7%), Australia (decrease of 100,000 hectares, -11%), Philippines (decrease of 12,000 hectares, -2%), and Myanmar (decrease of 10,000 hectares, -3%).

Indonesia, a returning biotech country has planted a new biotech drought tolerant sugarcane that can yield 20-30% higher than the parental varieties during drought conditions. The planting of the biotech drought tolerant sugarcane was developed to close the gap between domestic supply and demand for sugar as Indonesia is the world’s largest importer of sugar. The drought tolerant trait would allow farmers to plant even at periods with low rainfall which seems to become worse and frequent due to climate change.

There are a number of new biotech crops and traits in the pipeline for commercial release including the staple crops Golden Rice, late blight resistant potato, various biotech traits for wheat,  and IR (Bt) eggplant; biotech soybeans and maize for livestock and poultry feed; and varieties of cotton which contain stacked IR/HT traits.

One of the most important problems in Asia and the Pacific was the delay in approving new biotech crops and traits in China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Regulatory guidelines in these countries have been in place and used to regulate biotech products efficiently for more than a decade, but the changing political climate and the loud voice of critics have become a strong barrier for trade and commercialization of biotech crops.

The Kingdom of eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) was the latest and third African country to plant biotech cotton
The African continent remains the region with the biggest potential to reap the benefits associated with modern agricultural biotechnology. In 2018, the continent recorded impressive growth with South Africa planting 2.7 million hectares of biotech crops sustaining its ranking among the top 10 biotech crop countries in the last two decades. Moreover, Nigeria became the first country in the world to approve biotech cowpea, thus, adding a new biotech crop to the global biotech basket. The kingdom of eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) started commercial planting of IR (Bt) cotton on an initial launch of 250 hectares, making it the third African country to plant biotech crops. This brought the number of African countries currently growing biotech crops to 3 again – South Africa (2.7 million hectares), Sudan (with 243,000 hectares IR cotton), and eSwatini for a total of 3.14 million hectares. Two more countries – Ethiopia and Nigeria gave environmental release approvals: Ethiopia for Bt cotton, while Nigeria approved cotton and cowpea. Earlier, Kenya and Malawi also granted environmental release approvals and are working towards commercialization of biotech cotton in the short-term.

Two countries in the European Union continued to plant biotech maize at 121,000 hectares
Two countries in the European Union (EU), Spain and Portugal, have consistently planted biotech IR maize event MON810, the only biotech event approved in the EU. The total biotech crop area planted was 120,990 hectares, a slight decrease of 8% from 2017 area of 131,535 hectares. Spain planted 115,246 hectares, 95% of the total 131,535 biotech maize hectares, while Portugal planted 5,733 hectares. The acceptance of biotech crops in the EU is still far from improving. Spain and Portugal planted biotech maize because of the expected infestation brought by the European corn borer. There was less motivation to plant biotech maize in the EU since the market calls for non-biotech raw materials. Imports of feedstocks from Argentina, Brazil, and the US were mostly biotech. There were up to 30 million metric tons soybean products, 10 to 15 million metric tons of maize, and 2.5 to 4.5 million metric tons canola that have been exported to the EU. This situation is expected to continue as there was no change in the EU regulation, there was no approval for cultivation in sight, and movement against biotech crops was still strong. In the beginning of 2018, six biotech crops were authorized for entry into the EU for food and feed uses including four soybean events, one canola, and one renewal for maize. Before the end of the year, two new varieties of maize and renewal of three existing authorizations for maize and sugar beets were approved for food and feed uses.

STATUS OF APPROVED EVENTS FOR BIOTECH CROPS USED IN FOOD, FEED, PROCESSING, AND CULTIVATION
A total of 70 countries (42 + EU 28, counted as one) have issued regulatory approvals to genetically modified or biotech crops for consumption either as human food, animal feed, as well as for commercial cultivation. Since 1992, there have been 4,349 approvals granted by regulatory authorities of these 70 countries. These were granted to 387 biotech events from 27 biotech crops, excluding carnation, rose, and petunia.

Of these approvals, 2,063 were food, either for direct use or for processing, 1,461 were feed use, for direct use or processing, while 825 were for environmental release or cultivation. United States had the most number of GM events approved, followed by Mexico, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, EU, Colombia, and Brazil. Maize still had the most number of approved events (137 in 35 countries), followed by cotton (63 events in 27 countries), potatoes (49 events in 13 countries), soybeans (38 events in 31 countries), and canola (37 events in 15 countries).

The HT maize event NK603 (61 approvals in 28 countries + EU 28) still had the most number of approvals. It was followed by HT soybeans GTS 40-3-2 (57 approvals in 28 countries + EU 28), IR maize MON810 (55 approvals in 26 countries + EU 28), HT/IR maize Bt11 (54 approvals in 25 countries + EU 28), HT/IR maize TC1507 (53 approvals in 25 countries + EU 28), IR maize MON89034 (51 approvals in 24 countries + EU 28), HT maize GA21 (50 approvals in 23 countries + EU 28), HT soybeans MON89788 (45 approvals in 25 countries + EU 28), HT soybeans A2704-12 (45 approvals in 24 countries + EU 28), HT/IR maize MON88017 (45 approvals in 23 countries + EU-28), IR cotton MON531 (44 approvals in 20 countries + EU 28), IR maize MIR162 (43 approvals in 23 countries + EU 28), and HT maize T25 (43 approvals in 20 countries + EU 28).

CONTRIBUTION OF BIOTECH CROPS TO FOOD SECURITY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION
Biotech crops are being adopted globally because of the enormous benefits to the environment, health of humans and animals, and contributions to the improvement of socio economic conditions of farmers and the general public. Global economic gains contributed by biotech crops in the last 21 years (1996-2016) have amounted to US$186.1 billion economic benefits to more than 16 to 17 million farmers, 95% of whom come from developing countries.

Biotech crops contributed to food security, sustainability and climate change solutions by:

increasing crop productivity by by 657.6 million tons valued at US$186.1 billion in 1996-2016; and 82.2 million tons valued at US$18.2 billion in 2016 alone;
conserving biodiversity in 1996 to 2016 by saving 183 million hectares of land, and 22.5 million hectares of land in 2016 alone; providing a better environment
by saving on 671 million kg. a.i. of pesticides in 1996-2016, and by 48.5 million kg in 2016 alone from being released into the environment;
by saving on pesticide use by 8.2% in 1996-2016, and by 8.1% in 2016 alone;
by reducing EIQ (Environmental Impact Quotient) by 18.4% in 1996-2016, and by 18.3% in 2016 alone
reducing CO2 emissions in 2016 by 27.1 billion kg, equivalent to taking 16.7 million cars off the road for one year; and
helping alleviate poverty through uplifting the economic situation of 16-17 million small farmers, and their families totaling  &gt;65 million people, who are some of the poorest people in the world (Brookes and Barfoot, 2018). 
Thus, biotech crops can contribute to a “sustainable intensification” strategy favored by many science academies worldwide, which allows productivity and production to be increased on the current 1.5 billion hectares only of global crop land, thereby saving forests and biodiversity. Biotech crops are essential but are not a panacea, and adherence to good farming practices such as rotations and resistance management, are a must for biotech crops as they are for conventional crops.



ECONOMIC GAINS FROM BIOTECH CROPS REACHED US$186.1 BILLION FROM 1996 TO 2016
A total of US$186.1 billion economic benefits were gained by countries planting biotech crops from 1996 to 2016. The highest gain was obtained by the USA (US$ 80.3 billion), Argentina (US$23.7 billion), India (US$21.1 billion), Brazil (US$19.8 billion), China (US$19.6 billion), Canada (US$8 billion), and others (US$13.6 billion). For 2016 alone, six countries gained the most economically from biotech crops in 2016, they were the USA (US$7.3 billion), Brazil (US$3.8 billion), India (US$1.5 billion), Argentina (US$2.1 billion), China (US$1 billion), Canada (US$ 0.7 billion), and others (US1.8 billion) for a total of US$18.2 billion. For 2017, the US$18.2 billion economic benefits comprised of US$10 billion for developing countries and US$8.2 for industrial countries.

In 2017, the global market value of biotech crops, estimated by Cropnosis was US$17.2 billion, representing 23.9% of the US$70.9 billion global crop protection market in 2016, and 30% of the US$56.02 billion global commercial seed market (Cropnosis, personal communication, 2018). Two industry sources projected an increase of 8.3% to 10.5% in the global value of biotech seed market by the end of 2022 and 2025, respectively. These are enormous benefits that can be obtained in the seed market if biotech crops are continuously planted globally.

CONCLUSION
The Global Report on Food Crises 2017 revealed that the UN Millennium Development Goals (UN-MDG) that ended in 2015 were not achieved, and that around 108 million people in 48 food crisis-affected countries are still at risk or in severe acute food insecurity since 2016 (FAO, July 23, 2017). Moreover, the United Nations (UN) report State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World in 2018 indicated that for three years in a row (since 2016), there was a continuous increase of hunger worldwide, with current levels equivalent to the records a decade ago. The report also emphasized that there was a slow progress in addressing the multiple forms of malnutrition which includes child stunting and adult obesity, making the health of hundreds of millions of people at risk. These findings translate into a clear warning that more efforts must be done rapidly to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger by 2030.

Once again, in its 23rd year of commercialization, the increase in global biotech crop adoption (cultivation and import for food, feed, and processing) manifest satisfaction of more than 17 million farmers, 95% of whom are small farmers, and consumer acceptance due to the agricultural, socio-economic, and environmental benefits as well as food safety and nutritional improvement brought by biotech crops. The contribution of this continuing increase in biotech crop adoption could help in alleviating the problems of hunger and malnutrition globally. Ensuring that these benefits will continue now and in the future depends on the diligence and forward-looking regulatory steps based on science, critically looking at the benefits instead of risks, agricultural productivity with a sense of environmental conservation and sustainability, and most importantly taking into consideration the millions of hungry and impoverished populace in need of resources.

About IFPRI’s Peer Review Process
IFPRI books are policy-relevant publications based on original and innova- tive research conducted at IFPRI. All manuscripts submitted for publica- tion as IFPRI books undergo an extensive review procedure that is managed by IFPRI’s Publications Review Committee (PRC). Upon submission to the PRC, the manuscript is reviewed by a PRC member. Once the manuscript
is considered ready for external review, the PRC submits it to at least two external reviewers who are chosen for their familiarity with the subject mat- ter and the country setting. Upon receipt of these blind external peer reviews, the PRC provides the author with an editorial decision and, when necessary, instructions for revision based on the external reviews. The PRC reassesses the revised manuscript and makes a recommendation regarding publication to the director general of IFPRI. With the director general’s approval, the manuscript enters the editorial and production phase to become an IFPRI book.

Foreword
The problems and constraints of finding sustainable solutions to end hun- ger and poverty in Africa are well documented. Agriculture is a criti-
cal sector in that quest, as it contributes approximately 35 percent of the continent’s GDP while accounting for 70 percent of its labor force. The sec- tor is also considered significant in the deployment of overall economic devel- opment strategies in the majority of African countries. While there has been some progress in improving African agriculture, productivity improvements are being overshadowed by new and in some cases increased challenges, such as population growth, a changing climate, and the fact that fewer than 30 percent of farmers have access to or use of improved seeds. In addition, technological innovations in use in other developing regions are proving difficult to institute or become accepted practice and policy in Africa—and policies for technolog- ical innovation will be essential to feeding Africa’s population in the future.
One promising, yet controversial, technological innovation is biotech- nology. Biotechnology tools, including genetically modified crops and other organisms, have produced valuable products that have been adopted by a large number of farmers globally, including those in Argentina, Brazil, China, and India. Genetically modified (GM) crops have been approved for commercial release in Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa, while contained and con- fined testing of them has been performed in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and other countries. Despite the documented benefits to farmers in developing countries, including those in Africa, many policymakers and farmers in Africa south of the Sahara remain hesitant about the use of GM crops, and they need more information about their potential, benefits, costs, and safety in the African context.

Calls to increase agricultural productivity, such as those found in the Maputo Declaration of 2003 and the statement from the African Union Summit of 2009, have not had an impact on the biotechnology debate, in spite of perceptions that biotechnology innovation has largely bypassed the region. While panels convened by the African Union to facilitate multi- stakeholder dialogue have recommended more policy research on economic, social, ethical, environmental, intellectual property, and trade issues relevant to Africa, only limited progress has been made.
The International Food Policy Research Institute organized the conference “Bringing Economic Analysis to Inform Biotechnology and Biosafety Policies in Africa” in Entebbe, Uganda, in May 2009 to take stock of economic and policy research focused on biotechnology in Africa and to identify relevant issues to help guide future research. This book brings together the papers writ- ten for, and presentations made at, that conference.
The agricultural productivity challenges facing Africa will require a pro- active response and vigilant evaluation of biotechnology and its many tools. Genetically Modified Crops in Africa is meant to help policymakers assess whether and how biotechnology can contribute sustainable solutions to end- ing hunger and poverty in Africa.

Introduction and Background
José Falck-Zepeda, Guillaume Gruère, and Idah Sithole-Niang
Despite multiple internal and external investment efforts, Africa south of the Sahara (SSA) has not been completely successful in facing its agri- cultural and development constraints. This state of affairs has been
complicated with the rise of increasingly complex constraints on the conti- nent. The convergence of population growth, increased food production vul- nerability, rising climatic variability, governance and political instability, and delayed investments to overcome environmental and agricultural productiv- ity constraints appears to have thwarted agricultural development efforts. The region’s vulnerability to these binding constraints on food security, as well as on economic growth and prosperity, can be seen in the fact that SSA is still enduring the impacts of the global food and financial crises that occurred
in 2008 (IMF 2009; Arieff, Weiss, and Jones 2010; Brambila-Macias and Massa 2010).
Africa at the Crossroads
Indeed, the persistent impact of the global food and financial crises on SSA highlights the need for increased investments in the development of robust and resilient agricultural, food, fiber, and energy production systems. Increased investments focused on improving such systems can help address these coun- tries’ development challenges. Yet the historical record of investments in this area is littered with ambitious—and in many cases, failed—development plans, policies, and interventions. Easterly (2009) suggests that SSA focus on fea- sible, but homegrown, development interventions that seek solutions to spe- cific problems.
Raising agricultural productivity is considered one of the most impor- tant ways to help develop a robust and resilient agriculture and to increase rural income (World Bank 2007). Many examples exist of successful inter- ventions supporting agricultural development that have been built upon sci- ence, innovation, and the use of productivity-raising technologies (Spielman and Pandya-Lorch 2009). Among the broad set of available science and
 1

2 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
technology interventions, genetically engineered (GE) crops1 present an option that could help increase agricultural productivity, improve income, and contribute to achieving the goals of broader poverty alleviation and national development policies (FAO 2004).
The potential role of GE crops in addressing the continent’s constraints has been recognized in Africa ( Juma and Serageldin 2007). Accumulated expe- rience and knowledge in Africa and other developing countries (see Qaim 2009; Smale et al. 2009; Pontifical Academy of Sciences 2010; Potrykus and
Ammann 2010; Areal, Riesgo, and Rodriguez-Cerezo 2012) suggest that avail- able GE crops in the short and medium term may have significant value for
African agriculture. Yet their development and use remain controversial in many countries in SSA and in other developing countries. This is partly due
to an incomplete understanding of the appropriate development role for GE crops and other biotechnologies that are products of nascent innovation sys- tems in the subregion. Valuing the development potential for the introduction of GE crops in SSA must account for their potential development interven- tions within the scope of broader poverty alleviation efforts and national development policies, taking into account the economic and political contexts.
Like most technological interventions, GE crops will not solve all SSA devel- opment problems, nor will all available GE crops be useful—or appropriate— in the African context. Instead, African decisionmakers will need to evaluate
the specific value of each GE crop as a tool in the portfolio of potential inter- ventions that may be made available to farmers in the region. GE crops may be particularly important if they help solve specific crop productivity constraints
in Africa. This is true especially of those productivity constraints that have
not been resolved by conventional means, including conventional plant breed- ing, integrated pest management, and in those situations where other control/ productivity enhancement approaches may not be accessible to farmers.
To identify potential beneficial technologies, an assessment of economic impacts is called for, which includes analyses at the farm, national, and inter- national levels. In any such priority-setting exercise, the institutional setting needs to be accounted for, as it may have an impact on adoption, technology use, and output marketing by farmers in developing countries (see, for example,
1 Here we use the label “GE” for transgenic crops or products derived thereof, because it is one of the most commonly employed term used in the literature and public media. Other equally im- precise terms (such as genetically modified (GM) crops derived from modern biotechnology) could be used instead, and may be used interchangeably in the book. In this book we focus on GE crops, yet many of the issues discussed here apply to animals, arthropods and other insects, and microorganisms, which may become available in SSA.
 
Tripp 2009). So far, there are only limited examples of GE crop impact assess- ment. Smale et al. (2009) review the economic literature assessing GE crops in African and other developing countries’ agriculture, including their impact on
farmers, households, communities, and trade, and the institutional context in which these technologies may be deployed for potential use by farmers. They draw the four following lessons.
• On average, adoption has been profitable to users—but averages mask vari- ability in agroclimates, host cultivars, and farming practices.
• There are too few traits under study, and too few cases and authors— generalizations should not be drawn. More time is needed to describe the effects of adoption.
• During the next decade, practitioners will need to address cross- cutting issues for further study, such as impacts on poverty, gender, and public health.
• To address broader issues, impact assessment practitioners need to develop improved methods and draw from multidisciplinary collaborations.
Similar lessons have been reported in Qaim (2009, 2010); in recent meta- analyses of impact assessment studies of insect-resistant cotton by Finger et al. (2011); and for all GE crops in Areal, Riesgo, and Rodriguez-Cerezo et al. (2012).
The relatively limited research on the impact of GE crops implies that its contribution to the policy debate on GE crops and biotechnology in the con- tinent has also been limited. Moreover, the policy debate is being undermined because much of the discussion in Africa has yielded to external (and in some cases to internal) pressures to move away from science and rational debate and discussion, toward either antagonistic or unconditionally supportive views on GE crops (Novy et al. 2011; Takeshima and Gruère 2011). These polarized views generally lack robust data and evidence-based policy analysis, contribut- ing to confusion about the real or potential value of GE crops for Africa’s agri- culture, especially in African policy debates.
This book is an attempt to move the discussion away from polarized posi- tions. It aims to contribute to a rational debate on the actual benefits, costs, and risks of existing and future GE crops and technologies for Africa. To accomplish this goal, we introduce a broad set of contributions documenting issues relevant to the current African policy debate. These contributions are representative of the state-of-the-art knowledge about GE biotechnologies in

4 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Africa. We also include references to other papers and materials relevant to the debate when appropriate, which may help elucidate important questions for the proper assessment of GE crops and similar technologies in Africa.
The following sections aim at setting the stage for the policy debate on
GE crops. We briefly present the status of GE crop adoption and capacity in Africa. We then list a number of key potential constraints and describe some of the internal positions on biotechnology.
GE Crops: “Miracle Crops” or “Frankenfoods”?
GE crops have been portrayed unequivocally by those opposing or promot- ing the technology as either the solution for feeding the world, or in some instances, as crops that would bring environmental and social catastrophes
of incalculable consequences (Brac de la PerriFre and Seuret 2000; GRAIN 2004). Stone (2002) documents that such contrasting positions can and do obscure many of the complexities involved in GE crop adoption and their use in developing countries. A more balanced position would consider GE crops neither as Frankenfoods nor as Miracle Crops per se, but rather as a set of tech- nologies with unique attributes, different from past innovations, such as the Green Revolution’s maize and wheat varieties. In particular, many of these technologies have been produced using research and development (R&amp;D) inputs that are protected intellectual property, and most technologies now available commercially have been developed by the private sector.
These attributes need to be characterized, discussed, and in some cases addressed to ensure their compatibility with and support of poverty allevia- tion efforts, especially in the agricultural context of SSA. Furthermore, there is a need to clearly separate the intrinsic production, productivity, and socio- economic impacts of GE crops from more general concerns expressed by some stakeholders over forced industrialization, corporate control of agriculture, and the impact of technology on traditional farmers and agricultural prac- tices and communities. The latter implies the need to conduct in-depth social and institutional context analysis in which these varieties may be or have been released to farmers to ensure that society can determine the potential role of GE crops in development and poverty alleviation efforts (Stone 2011). This is especially important in the African context.
Stakeholder Support for GE Crops
GE crop supporters present these technologies as a distinct option to pro- mote food security and sustainable agriculture for developing countries. GE

crops open the possibility of addressing biotic and abiotic constraints to food, feed, and fiber production. GE crops may, for example, enhance pro- ductivity, improve pest and weed control, and increase tolerance to drought and salinity. These crops may also improve public health through reductions in pesticide applications and through enhanced nutrition, such as vitamin
A–enhanced rice that is currently being evaluated in a number of develop- ing countries. Yet different stakeholders have contrasting positions toward these technologies.
Stakeholder Criticisms of GE Crops
Some stakeholders often cite the fact that existing GE crops were largely devel- oped by the private sector for use in industrialized countries in an intensive and commercially focused agriculture. The consequence of this approach, in their view, is that existing GE crops are inappropriate for traditional agricul- ture as practiced in Africa and other developing countries. They believe that this approach empowers private firms to exercise monopoly power and thus price the technology at a higher level than in a competitive market (Moschini and Lapan 1997; Falck-Zepeda, Traxler, and Nelson 2000). Private sector–led agricultural R&amp;D is a different pathway than that taken by previous agricul- tural innovation processes, which have been driven mostly by the public sec- tor. The private sector–led R&amp;D investments and continued control over GE crops is seen by some commentators as one more example of corporate control of agriculture and its activities.
Other issues have been raised, such as the “contamination” of traditional varieties due to pollen flow, uncontrolled gene dispersion, impacts on trade, disruption of traditional communities and livelihoods, dependency on pri- vate sector, production risk increasing due to the rise of monocultures, and the decline of smallholder crop diversification.2 These concerns may or may not be unique to GE crops. They may also belong to a larger set of general con- cerns over the role of science and technology in contributing to poverty alle- viation and development. Furthermore, it is not always clear whether these
2 For a summary of the biological and environmental issues, see Conner, Glare, and Nap (2003). For a broader discussion that also includes social issues, see Uzogara (2000) and Stone (2002).
In some cases and under a relatively complex set of conditions, the introduction of modern varieties—including GE crops—can introduce the potential for private firms exercising monop- oly power over resource-poor households and farmers in developing countries. This outcome is valid but dependent on a set of conditions that determine its likelihood. In particular, it is a pos- sible scenario where market conditions are such that they force farmers in developing countries to become members of captive markets with little or no choice for a diversity of crop varieties or other production alternatives. Therefore conventional or traditional varieties preserved by farm- ers could disappear over time (Munro 2003; Knezevic 2007).
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 5
 
6 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
concerns apply to existing technologies or to proposed technologies in the development pipeline for the African context.
Toward a More Balanced Approach
Certainly, some of these stakeholder concerns and issues may be valid for some crops or incorporated traits through genetic engineering in some locations. In our view, each concern is an empirical issue that has to be identified and ana- lyzed as part of an ex ante assessment of GE crops before deliberate release into the environment.
A prudent approach would consider the relevant facts and then render a robust and complete analysis of the appropriateness of a specific technology for its intended target country or region. One cannot generalize that GE crops are either unequivocally Frankenfoods or Miracle Crops. A rational approach would require judging GE crops on a case-by-case basis while considering all the costs, benefits, and risks estimated through robust assessments.
Still, following Norman Borlaug’s and Jimmy Carter’s opinions (Paarlberg 2008), we believe that the GE crop assessment process, as it stands now,
needs to concentrate less on their potential risk (especially in the case of well- studied technologies where there is an established record of safety and use in other countries) and more on their actual impact and on their access by poor farmers. A redirected focus on development efforts is needed to ensure that poor farmers could benefit from the assessed, safe, relevant, and beneficial GE crops in their context. Separating generalized issues from the facts germane to useful GE crop development, deployment, access, and performance is one of the motivating factors behind this book.
GE Crop Adoption: The Reality behind the Numbers
The area planted to GE crops has increased at a rapid pace since the release of the first commercial crops in the United States and China. As of 2011, there were approximately 160 million hectares worldwide cultivated with the crops ( James 2011). Yet the growth in area planted continues to be focused mainly on four crops (soybeans, maize, cotton, and canola) and two traits (herbicide tolerance and insect resistance). Small areas in several countries have been planted with other crops, including alfalfa, beans, tomatoes, petunias, papayas, potatoes, sweet peppers, squash, carnations, and sugar beets.
Developing countries cultivate approximately 50 percent of the global area devoted to GE crops, totaling close to 80 million hectares. Importantly,

the share planted by developing countries has been increasing over time and may even become higher than that of developed countries ( James 2011). As shown in Figure I.1, developing countries with the highest area planted in 2011 included Brazil (30.3 million hectares), Argentina (23.7 million), India (10.6 million), China (3.9 million), Paraguay (2.8 million), and Pakistan (2.6 million).
In 2011, the share of GE crops planted in Africa was small. Africa’s share was less than 1.6 percent of the total area planted to GE crops (see Figure I.2). Similar to the evolution across all developing countries, the area planted by African countries has been increasing over time. Furthermore, the number of crops in the product development and the biosafety regulatory pipeline and those that have been commercialized have also been increasing over time in the continent. The need then exists to examine the current status of GE crops in the product development and regulatory pipelines as a necessary background to understand the issues discussed in this book. The next section addresses these issues in some detail.

Africa’s Biotechnology Capacity, Biosafety Status, and Adoption Impact
The status of biosafety regulatory frameworks and of GE crop technologies play a role in the observed low level of GE crop adoption in Africa. Currently, there are no completely indigenous GE crop technologies generated in Africa that we are aware of, except possibly in Egypt. Most technologies under devel- opment for SSA use genetic constructs or transformation procedures devel- oped elsewhere, and plant germplasm materials are usually selected and developed internally in the country of interest.
Biosafety Regulatory Framework Status
The foundation of biosafety regulatory systems, the national biosafety framework (NBF), includes policies, laws, and implementation regula-
tions. Countries implement their national biosafety framework by mobiliz- ing human, financial, and technical capacities in the country, which permits agents to conduct a biosafety assessment and then submit a recommendation, or in some cases, a decision.
Figure I.3 presents a map of the status of NBFs in Africa as of 2009. Their status in this figure is described as functional, interim, work in

progress, and nonexistent, depending on the degree of evolution shown by countries at that particular point in time. It should be noted that in this fig- ure, even if an NBF has been described as “functional,” it does not neces- sarily mean that the country has approved a GE crop for deliberate release. Country statuses have not changed much since this figure was developed.
There were two relevant developments: Uganda has approved several con- fined field trials and is developing a formal policy, and Nigeria has approved a policy and is in the process of developing implementation regulations and approving confined field trials.
At the same time, the biosafety regulatory development process has evolved sufficiently to permit confined field trials in Burkina Faso, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, and commercialization release in Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa. The ability to conduct confined field tri-
als is a parameter that helps document biosafety assessment capacity as it is

Biotechnology Product Development/Regulatory Pipeline
Table I.1 lists GE crop technologies under product development or biosafety regulatory assessment. The number of GE crops is expanding beyond the four crops with two traits planted as the dominant share of global GE crop area; the number of countries testing and approving them is also expanding. A note- worthy development is the rise of crops of special interest to some countries in
Africa, including bananas, sweet potatoes, cowpeas, and cassava. Furthermore, the number of traits in development is also increasing. These include resis- tance to fungal and viral diseases and tolerance to drought conditions.
GE Cotton and Maize Adoption and Socioeconomic Impact in Africa
According to the estimates of James (2011), in 2011, South Africa cultivated approximately 2.3 million hectares, Burkina Faso 0.3 million hectares, and Egypt less than 0.05 million hectares of GE crops. Maize and cotton account for most of the area planted to GE crops in Africa.
More specifically, South Africa planted 2.3 million hectares of GE maize, cotton, and soybeans. Burkina Faso cultivated 300,000 hectares of insect- protected cotton (Bt) representing approximately 70 percent of total cotton area, which represents a significant increase from 2009, when roughly 25 percent of the area was planted to Bt cotton (James 2011). In Egypt, the actual area planted has been quite small since the commercialization approval granted by the com- petent authority in 2008. Much of the area planted has been for seed reproduc- tion purposes, although there are some reports that the expectation in Egypt is that area planted to GE maize will increase rapidly in the near future (Adenle 2011; James 2011).
The socioeconomic impact assessment literature on the effects of GE crops in SSA is relatively thin. As shown in Smale et al. (2009), much of the ex post assessment work has been done on measuring producer impacts from the adoption of GE crops, mostly focused on insect-resistant cotton in South
Africa, with a handful of reports from Burkina Faso. There is a small, but grow- ing, ex ante assessment body of literature for proposed technologies in Africa. Reports from South Africa and other developing countries that have adopted GE crops show that considerable spatial, temporal, and user variabilities exist and have an impact on results. These conclusions have been validated in a for- mal meta-analysis done by Finger et al. (2011).

14 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
From Concept to Farmers:
Issues for GE Crops in the African Context
This rapid review of the situation in SSA triggers a number of questions. Why aren’t more GE crops being deployed in Africa? Should we be seeing more GE crops being deployed in Africa? What are the appropriate crops and traits that may support smallholder agriculture in Africa? Will these technologies con- tribute to poverty alleviation efforts?
The answers proposed to these questions vary significantly in the literature. Current and future GE crops clearly face a number of deployment challenges. Some challenges are common to the dissemination of all new technologies
in SSA. Other challenges are unique to GE crops and may require innovative approaches for addressing these constraints in a meaningful way. In the next section, some of these issues are discussed in a technology framework chain with the intention of properly situating the issues, constraints, benefits, and other relevant issues to a decisionmaker in Africa.
Technology Development, Adaptation, and Dissemination Issues
SSA faces a situation where there is a growing but still insufficient level of investment in R&amp;D, especially in a select group of countries (Beintema and Stads 2010). The generalized level of R&amp;D investments in SSA translates into a relatively poor biotechnology innovative capacity. This in turn affects the capacity for conducting GE adaptive and targeted R&amp;D in the continent.
The low availability of human and financial resources in the region limits the overall innovative capacity to conduct R&amp;D and to develop indigenous GE crops. Unlike other crops, GE crops have to comply with biosafety regulations and be subject to risk assessments. To do so, countries have to sustain a suffi- cient decisionmaking capacity. Although many SSA countries are still lacking a regulatory framework or a scientific and regulatory capacity to implement such regulations, some notable efforts are underway to develop robust bio- safety systems.
National innovative capacity that can develop those GE traits of interest to national priorities has to be weighed against the possibility of accessing such technologies developed elsewhere. From a science and technology standpoint,
African decisionmakers can opt for different innovative capacity systems to deliver products to farmers. Some countries in Africa, though, lack even the minimal investments in R&amp;D capacity necessary to conduct adaptive R&amp;D in their own national research systems. Furthermore, some countries in the region have expressed a concern over the potential risks of these technologies to their farmers. Such concerns are not insurmountable hurdles, as there are

practical and feasible approaches that can empower countries to ensure an acceptable level of safety after a scientific assessment, while ensuring innova- tion and technology transfer to their farmers.
African seed systems and germplasm delivery mechanisms face a number of constraints that have been described in the literature. Technology delivery and dissemination are limited by institutional weaknesses and the insufficient development of national seed systems in Africa. These constraints are not unique to GE crop seeds. Yet they can be magnified as the need arises to ensure a working system that facilitates knowledge and information exchange about the use of the technology, and market signal transmissions, including price premiums or value-added paid for competing commodities in markets.
Developing an appropriate science and technology strategy that directs investments in R&amp;D capacity and strategy toward identified GE crops is criti- cal. To do so, the costs, benefits, and risks that GE technologies may pose to farmers need to be thoroughly examined, in order to select “best bet” strate- gies to address specific productivity constraints in Africa.
Obstacles Related to Adoption
Farmers considering the adoption of GE crops face many institutional chal- lenges. Access to credit and complementary inputs, their ability to manage production risk, and other binding institutional constraints play determinant roles in their decisions. A very important issue identified in a growing number of studies is farmers’ access to knowledge and information about the use of the technology and its market potential. Many of the GE crops available for adop- tion in and outside Africa have demonstrated their technical capability to pro- vide benefits to farmers. However, a farmer’s ability to tap into those potential benefits can be limited by institutional issues.
This calls for policymakers to consider supporting the policy and institu- tional environment to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of GE crop adoption in Africa. In this sense, the policy environment will strive to avoid potential cases of “technological triumphs but institutional failures” observed (Gouse et al. 2005, 1).
Marketing/Trade in Local and External Markets and Related Issues of Consumer Acceptance
The introduction and use of a GE crop in any country can potentially result in loss in export markets to trade-sensitive countries for the specific crop being considered. In some situations, African countries have argued that the potential approval and use of GE crops can even lead to the potential loss to unrelated
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 15

16 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
export markets. Although such perceptions may be misplaced, African coun- tries may face pressures by private buyers and consumer demand in trade- sensitive countries (Gruère and Sengupta 2009; Gruère and Takeshima 2012).
Market risks associated with potential external trade losses due to the adop- tion of GE crops are magnified by the growing trend in consumer concerns
in African countries, especially among urban consumers, and by labeling and related marketing requirements in some consumer-sensitive countries around the world, especially Europe, some countries in Asia, and the Middle East.
An additional issue is the increased possible trade losses associated with asyn- chronous or asymmetric approvals of GE crops. GE crops that are approved in one country but not in other trading partners can result in significant trade dis- ruptions. Because borders in Africa can be porous, and as regional trade increases within Africa, this issue may grow in importance. This calls for policies exam- ining potential export losses with trade-sensitive countries and across regions in
Africa to search for an adequate management strategy.
The trend toward a regionalization of biosafety assessment procedures and
the capacity to establish a regulatory decisionmaking process also require sup- port. Efforts such as those in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which seek regional approaches to biosafety assessments and in some cases to decisionmaking, will become more important with increasing trade activity at the subregional level.
Contrasting Stakeholder Positions in Africa
Although the problems can be identified, the complexity of the African politi- cal debate around GE products has to be accounted for. In particular, there are many contrasting positions with regard to GE crops in SSA. For example, the High-Level Panel on Biotechnology report commissioned by the African Union (AU) and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) states that
Africa needs to take strategic measures aimed at promoting the appli- cation of modern biotechnology to regional economic integration and trade. Such measures include fostering the emergence of regional inno- vation systems in which biotechnology-related Local Innovation Areas play a key role. [ Juma and Serageldin 2007, xix]
The AU/NEPAD Panel laid out some of the preconditions for taking advan- tage of GE crops to support economic development efforts, especially with

regard to regional economic coordination efforts to ensure proper and effi- cient regulatory assessment processes. Suggested by the AU/NEPAD Panel,
a regional approach to biotechnology and biosafety regulations is being pur- sued independently by COMESA and by the Economic Community of West
African States. These efforts are examining different modalities for devel- oping regional approaches to biosafety regulations that seek to address risk- assessment procedures combined with national or regional decisionmaking.
They do not represent an explicit endorsement of biotechnology or GE crops per se; rather, they open the possibility of examining these technologies on
a case-by-case basis.
In turn, in its official “Statement on Plant Breeding and Genetic Engineering,” the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) has this position with regard to GE crops and other organisms:
Our mission is not to advocate for or against the use of genetic engi- neering. We believe it is up to governments, in partnership with their citizens, to use the best knowledge available to put in place policies and regulations that will guide the safe development and acceptable use
of new technologies, as several African countries are in the process of doing. We will consider funding the development and deployment of such new technologies only after African governments have endorsed and provided for their safe use. Our mission is to use the wide variety of tools and techniques available now to make a dramatic difference for
Africa’s smallholder farmers as quickly as possible. [AGRA 2010]
AGRA’s position is basically neutral; it leaves any decision in terms of future investments pending on decisions taken at the national level. This decision contrasts with national developments. Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa have allowed the commercial cultivation of these crops by authorizing their deliberate release into the environment. More countries have approved con- fined field trials or have invested in the development of GE crops developed by the public sector for those issues of interest to African countries. This posi- tion also contrasts with that of countries that have explicit restrictive policies with regard to the importation of GE foods ranging from a complete ban on all imports (Zambia) to a ban on imports unless processed or milled (Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, and Zimbabwe).
Positions for or against the technology are not limited to the national level. Some organizations with stated missions that include social justice, biodiver- sity protection, small farmer livelihood assurance, and food security (such as the Third World Network, Via Campesina, Greenpeace, Oxfam, GRAIN, or
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 17

18 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Friends of the Earth International) have argued and conducted campaigns against the deployment of GE technologies in developing countries, including those in Africa. It is not always clear whether these organizations’ positions are against GE crops per se, an opposition to existing GE crops being deployed in developing countries, or a reaction to industrialization, multinational corpora- tion development, or privatization of agricultural research, but they are vocally opposed to GE crops.
Although some of these groups continue to push their own agendas, they may not have addressed the complex issues surrounding the potential intro- duction and dissemination of GE crops, including consideration of the poten- tial benefits from adoption and the reality that not adopting a GE crop could also have consequences (Pew Initiative on Biotechnology 2004). Although there may be some risks associated with the use of GE crops, the status quo in terms of conventional crops is not riskless either. The influence of donor and partner countries plays a key role in this area. So do trade relationships and various international pressure groups.
In fact, decisionmakers in SSA are bombarded with multiple, mostly con- flicting positions and messages about the appropriateness of GE crops in the
African context. The policy debate milieu grew to such a chaotic state that the AU’s declaration after its 2006 Ministerial Meeting included text that described the situation poignantly:
The two extreme positions have tended to confuse many African policy- makers and sections of the public because of the lack of reliable infor- mation and guidance available to these groups. There is uncertainty
and confusion in many of the African governments’ responses to a wide range of social, ethical, environmental, trade and economic issues associ- ated with the development and application of modern genetic engineer- ing. The absence of an African consensus and strategic approaches to address these emerging biotechnology issues has allowed different inter- est groups to exploit uncertainty in policymaking, regardless of what may be the objective situation for Africa. [African Union 2006, 1]
In this setting, policy research has a role to play in examining the potential and actual use of GE crops and related issues to its deployment. As an impor- tant African policymaker said at the 5th Conference of Parties of the Biosafety Protocol in Nagoya, Japan:
Given the lack of consensus amongst countries and the conflictive con- text, it is therefore imperative that any GE crop assessment work be

buttressed by proper science (natural or social), otherwise it will be crit- icized by those opposing or promoting this technology. It is a mammoth task, yes, but somebody has to start the ball rolling. It’s a challenge that we must embrace. [A. Mafa, pers. comm., 2010]
This book is a first step in this direction. In this complex and competitive setting, information is critical for multiple purposes. When writing a policy, drafting regulations, or making discrete decisions on GE crops, policymakers in SSA have to use selected information to advance their goals. Yet credible objective information on the impacts of GE crops and products based on their cost, risks, and benefits is not always easy to find and to digest, given the complexity of some of the issues at stake. Furthermore, even policy ana- lysts, researchers, and academics involved in agriculture policy may find it hard to find, access, and synthesize peer-reviewed studies on GE crops in the
African context. This is particularly true when gauging the economic effects of GE crops.
Why This Book?
Several countries in SSA have expressed concerns related to the farm-
level impacts, consumer concerns, trade impacts, and the biosafety and other regulatory issues related to GE crops and are considering inclusion of socio- economic assessments in their technology approval processes.3
For example, discussions during the approval process and subsequent adop- tion of GE crops in Burkina Faso and South Africa have generated significant internal controversies related to the potential socioeconomic, institutional, political, and environmental effects of technology adoption. Controversies and sometimes acrimonious discussions included socioeconomic concerns about the potential market effects of local adoption of Bt cotton, impacts on resource- poor farmers, farmers’ dependence on a continuous flow of innovations, as
well as external impacts that may affect local farmers (such as the potentially adverse reaction in some European markets). Other important concerns raised by opponents of the technology are the potential environmental and ecologi- cal implications of GM technologies, all of which bring additional uncertainty to the likelihood of farmer adoption. Examples of these discussions and debates include Pschorn-Strauss (2005) and Moola and Munnik (2007).
3 Example of countries considering such policies can be found in Mulenga and Shumba-Mnyulwa (2010) and Falck-Zepeda (2009).

20 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
These questions have also been raised in national and international forums in the context of biosafety regulatory and technology decisionmaking pro- cesses. African decisionmakers and all stakeholders involved in the process raise these questions, as they aim at identifying potential interventions to address specific productivity issues that impinge directly on farmer livelihoods.
A better understanding of the development, delivery, and downstream impact of GE crop innovations is required to comprehend their potential role in the African context. This will ensure that the right crops, traits, and deliv- ery methods are identified and used. Furthermore, understanding knowledge processes and the institutional framework in which GE crops may be deployed can help ensure maximization of the potential benefits while minimizing the risk to African farmers and communities.
The overall objective of this book is to contribute to reducing the knowl- edge gap about the potential role and impact of GE crops in SSA. The volume gathers a set of policy and economic studies recently completed on the current or potential effects of GE products in the countries of this region. Although the collection does not claim to be exhaustive in any way, it provides a discus- sion of relevant issues discussed in SSA and other policy forums, as well as some new and emerging themes. This book addresses some of the key policy questions in the debate on the role of GE crops in the region. The targeted audience includes policy analysts, policymakers, scientists, researchers, uni- versity students, and other stakeholders working on policy issues related to agricultural biotechnology in Africa and who are interested in an accessible volume on policy analysis.
The collection of studies is based on updated contributions that were ini- tially presented at a conference organized by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in Entebbe, Uganda, in May 2009. Chapters are organized thematically in three parts. Part I consists of three chapters on the economic effects of GE crops, with a focus on specific technologies. Part II presents two chapters on market acceptance, including one on consumer acceptance of GE food in Uganda and another discussing potential trade risk and regional integration. Part III focuses on research, regulatory, and tech- nology delivery issues. Although each chapter addresses one specific question, it also provides general lessons for policymakers. The book ends with a conclu- sion section that collects lessons and issues for policy and decisionmaking and identifies areas for future research.
Throughout the book, care has been taken to consider the distinct opin- ions and positions in the debate. IFPRI’s policy toward biotechnology is that even though some of these technologies are controversial and alone cannot

solve complex poverty and food insecurity issues, some of them have the potential to address specific issues related to hunger and malnutrition in devel- oping countries. Because of these considerations
IFPRI believes it would be irresponsible not to assess the potential
of genetically modified crops such as nutrient-enriched or drought- tolerant and disease-resistant crop varieties. At the same time, the Institute fully supports appropriate biosafety regulatory systems that are able to assess the risks. [IFPRI 2013]
We hope that this contribution will help inform the debates, in Africa and elsewhere, about the current and potential economic role of these crops in the agriculture of SSA. Furthermore, we expect that this book will help iden- tify current knowledge gaps and engage the innovation, product delivery, and downstream impacts related to GE crops in Africa in a more systematic man- ner, while at the same time providing relevant and timely information to the ongoing discussions related to the potential adoption and use of GE crops.

Chapter 1
Socioeconomic and Farm-Level Effects of Genetically Modified Crops: The Case of Bt Crops in South Africa
Marnus Gouse
The year 2011 was the 14th since the first commercial release of a genetically modified (GM) crop in South Africa. In 1997/98, insect- resistant (Bt) cotton was released for production, and South Africa became the first country in Africa where a GM crop was produced on a com- mercial level. Bt maize was approved for commercial production in 1998/99, and Bt yellow maize was planted in the same season. The first plantings of Bt white maize in 2001/02 established South Africa as the first GM subsis- tence crop producer in the world. Herbicide-tolerant (HT) cotton was made available for commercial production in the 2001/02 season along with HT soybeans. Commercialization of HT maize seeds followed in 2003/04. GM cotton containing the combined or “stacked” trait (Bt and HT) was released for the 2005/06 season, and Bt/HT maize was released for the 2007/08 pro- duction season.
This chapter supplies a brief summary of the performance, socioeconomic impacts, and main issues surrounding Bt cotton and GM maize in South Africa. A substantial number of peer reviewed papers on GM crops in South Africa have been published, and it is recommended that interested readers refer to these publications for more in-depth information and discussion on the studies and findings.
South African Biosafety Framework
In 1989 a US seed company approached the South African Department of Agriculture for permission to perform contained field trials with Bt cotton. This set in motion the South African biosafety regulatory process and ini- tiated the first trials with GM crops on the African continent. The South African Committee for Genetic Experimentation (SAGENE) had been formed in 1979 by public and private scientists to monitor and advise the National Department of Agriculture and industry on the responsible development of
 25

26 CHAPTER 1
genetically modified organisms (GMOs) through the provision of guidelines and the approval of research centers and projects. SAGENE gained statutory sta- tus in 1992 as the national advisory committee on modern GM biotechnology. The approval for the commercial release of Bt cotton and maize was done under the guidelines of SAGENE for the 1997/98 and 1998/99 seasons. These guide- lines and procedures remained the biosafety framework cornerstone until South Africa’s GMO Act 15 of 1997 was approved by Parliament in June 1997 and entered into force in November 1999, when the regulations were published. In 1999 SAGENE was replaced by the scientific Advisory Committee that was established under the GMO Act (Wolson and Gouse 2005). The South African GMO Act 15/1997, as amended in 2006, provides a comprehensive biosafety framework to manage research, development, application, production, and trade in GMOs. The GMO Secretariat is housed in the Department of Agriculture, and decisionmaking is vested in the GMO Executive Council that represents eight government departments. The Council is advised by a national Advisory Committee of scientific experts.
Since implementation, the GMO legislation has served the country well in its balanced approach to modern biotechnology and its applications. However, more recently there have been some unclear delays in the decisionmaking pro- cess, and the scientific community and academia have expressed concern that decisionmaking has become less scientific and a lack of transparency in the process could lead to an increase in the cost of regulation and in the opportu- nity cost for research institutions, innovators, and in reality, consumers.
Bt Cotton
In 2007 GM cotton globally covered 15 million hectares (43 percent of total world cotton), of which Bt varieties accounted for 10.8 million hectares
and a further 3.2 million hectares as Bt combined with a second Bt or with an herbicide-tolerance trait ( James 2007). In 2009 the global GM cotton area increased to 16.2 million hectares and in 2011 to 25 million or 68 percent
of global cotton plantings ( James 2009, 2011). Historically, cotton has been responsible for about 25 percent of global chemical insecticides used in agri- culture due to attacks by a range of insect pests (Woodburn 1995), with cot- ton bollworm being the main pest. In an effort to reduce insecticide use and with insect resistance build-up against chemicals, Bt technology has offered a cost-saving and environmentally friendlier alternative.
Cotton planting in South Africa declined from its peak of 180,000 hect- ares in 1988 (under tariff protection) to just over 5,000 hectares in 2010 due

SOCIOECONOMIC AND FARM-LEVEL EFFECTS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS 27
to a combination of market liberalization, low world cotton prices, and rela- tively better prices for competing crops like maize, sunflower seed, and sugar cane. South Africa has been a net importer of cotton for the past couple of decades. In 1997/98 South Africa became the first country in Africa to com- mercially produce GM crops with the release of Bt cotton. The initial uptake of the first Bt cotton varieties of the US cotton seed company, Delta and Pineland (D&amp;PL), was less than spectacular, as the conventional varieties of local ginning companies were more popular. Some commercial farmers were also cautious during the first seasons and wanted to test the new technology and see how ginners and the rest of the industry reacted. However, when the Bt gene was introduced into D&amp;PL’s popular OPAL variety (originally from Australia), adoption increased dramatically. NuOPAL (Bt), DeltaOPAL RR (HT), and NuOPAL RR (Stacked Bt/HT), which are currently planted in South Africa, are all based on the Delta OPAL germplasm (Gouse 2009).
As clearly shown in Table 1.1, Bt cotton has been very popular, reaching 70 percent of total cotton area in 2003. The share decreased somewhat
with the introduction of HT cotton, but Bt cotton remained the more popular of the two. With the introduction of stacked cotton (with both
the Bt and HT events), Bt’s share dropped considerably as farmers opted
for cotton with both traits. By the 2005/06 season 92 percent of the cotton plantings in South Africa were GM. A large share of the conventional cotton being planted is mandatory refugia that are planted alongside Bt fields to prevent insect-resistance development. Farmers tend to plant HT cotton as refugia for stacked Bt/HT plantings.
Despite various land reform and development projects attempting to set- tle small-scale farmers in established and potential cotton production areas, the traditional areas of Tonga (in Kangwane Mpumalanga) and Makhathini Flats (KwaZulu-Natal) remain the major contributors to smallholder cotton production. The total number of smallholder cotton producers has varied but generally amounts to a few thousand farmers with the vast majority of them situated on the Makhathini Flats. As large-scale farmers produce the bulk of the South African cotton crop, it would not be totally correct to suggest that the adoption figures in Table 1.1 apply to smallholders as well, though Bt cot- ton adoption by smallholders has not been less impressive. In the first com- mercialization season of 1997, only 4 farmers planted demonstration Bt plots under the guidance of Monsanto (the technology owner). In 1998, 75 farm- ers, or 3.4 percent of the cotton farmers on Makhathini, planted Bt cotton; in 1999, 411 farmers, or 13.7 percent, planted Bt. In 2000, 1,184 cotton farm- ers (39.5 percent) on the Makhathini Flats planted Bt cotton. In 2001 it was

Notes: Figures in previous publications have been updated with additional and revised figures. Official figures for the most recent years were not available at time of writing. Unofficial indications suggest that in 2012 nearly 100% of cotton produced in South Africa was GM, with stacked cotton making up the major share and farmers planting HT cotton as mandatory refugia. Bt = insect resistant; HT = herbicide tolerant.

estimated that close to 3,000 of the 3,229 farmers on the Flats planted Bt, reaching close to 90 percent adoption in five years (Gouse 2009).
This remarkable adoption rate was explained partly by the impressive performance of Bt cotton as planted by the first adopting Makhathini farm- ers. However, the other major explanation was that the sole credit and input supplier and cotton buyer on the Flats, Vunisa, also noticed the performance of Bt cotton and started to recommend the seed to its clients/farmers. As the main objective of a cotton gin is to gin as much cotton as possible, Vunisa wanted to increase the cotton crop on the Flats but not at the expense of their credit book. After monitoring the performance of Bt cotton for the first couple of seasons, Vunisa decided that it could increase the ginable cot- ton crop, and decrease the risk of crop failure (due to bollworm damage)
and thus their credit risk by recommending Bt cotton to farmers. It can
be argued that even though Vunisa was making inputs available to farm-
ers under credit long before Bt was introduced, the availability of credit and the role Vunisa’s extension officers had in recommending Bt seed played a large role in smallholders’ ability and decision to adopt the new technology (Gouse 2009).
All the peer reviewed publications on Bt cotton in South Africa (mainly focusing on smallholder farmers) report yield increases with the use of Bt cotton compared to conventional varieties (Table 1.2). Almost all studies also showed savings in insecticide expenditure; with the exception of results from the one-year, 20-farmer study by Hofs, Fok, and Vaissayre (2006). Even though most of the yield differences were substantial, some were found not to be statistically significant, mainly due to small sample sizes and large vari- ability in the data. Compared to study results in countries like Australia, China, India, and Mexico, the relative yield gain from the use of Bt cotton in South Africa is higher. One of the reasons for this is that the base yield (non- Bt cotton) of smallholders is very low, and a small change in yield is exag- gerated when expressed relative to a low conventional variety yield. In fact, in some other countries, the yield advantage of Bt cotton was more than the total seed cotton yield attained per hectare in South Africa (Fok et al. 2007). Gouse, Kirsten, and Jenkins (2003) found an 18.5 percent yield increase
for South African large-scale irrigation farmers for the 2000/2001 sea-
son, which compares well with a 16.8 percent increase measured on field trials at a Clark Cotton (a ginning company) experimental farm in Mpuma- langa. Large-scale dryland farmers enjoyed a 14 percent yield increase, while some studies found that small-scale dryland farmers enjoyed an increase of between 23 and 85 percent over a number of seasons (Table 1.2).

SOCIOECONOMIC AND FARM-LEVEL EFFECTS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS 31
These trends are consistent with findings elsewhere, such as in Argentina (Qaim, Cap, and De Janvry 2003), where large-scale commercial farmers were reported to enjoy 19 percent yield increases and smallholder farmers reported
41 percent yield increases. Like Qaim, Cap, and De Janvry (2003), South African researchers attribute the difference between the Bt yield advantages of small-
and large-scale farmers to the financial and human capital constraints that cause smallholders to invest in chemical pest control. Shankar and Thirtle (2005) showed that the average insecticide application level of smallholder farmers on the Makhathini Flats is lower than 50 percent of the optimal level; it is thus not surprising that Bt cotton is able to substantially reduce the yield loss caused by bollworms. With low control-group yields and limited (and in many cases in- effective) chemical insecticide applications, exaggerated yield increases in excess of 50, 60, and 80 percent as reported by Bennett, Morse, and Ismael (2006) do not seem so mind-boggling. But these results have to be seen in context, and as the authors caution, the figures might also be inflated due to selection bias.
The yield increase with Bt cotton, compared to conventional cotton, depends on the bollworm infestation level in the particular season and the effectiveness of chemical bollworm control by the farmer. It can be expected that the yield advantage will differ across farmers, farms, regions, and seasons (Fok et al. 2007). Both large-scale and smallholder farmers enjoyed significant savings on insecticides (generally 3/4/5 pyrethroid sprays), and despite higher expenditure on seed (as a result of the additional technology fee), they enjoyed a higher gross margin. However, it is important to stress that Bt does not kill all insects, and chemical spraying is still required to prevent damage by sucking insects, which in the past have been killed in the cross-fire aimed at bollworms.
The Bt technology fee was adjusted downward by about 24 percent
after the introduction season, following farmer concerns that the technol-
ogy was not affordable. The fee was then held constant at South African rand (ZAR) 600 per 25 kilograms of seed (between about $50 and $75 according
to the fluctuating local currency)1 for 1999/2000–2002/03, at ZAR700 for 2003/04–2004/05, and then at ZAR785 from 2005/06 to the 2008/09 season. Between 1999 and 2008 a 25 kilogram bag of conventional cotton sold for between ZAR150 and ZAR430. This means that the extra Bt technology fee per 25 kilogram bag was between 1.8 and 4.0 times the price of the bag of seeds (Gouse 2009).
Analysis of “who gains?” from Bt technology showed that despite the high technology fee, farmers captured the lion’s share of the additional benefits

generated by the introduction of this new technology (Gouse, Pray, and Schimmelpfennig 2004). Basing their calculations on the abovementioned studies, Brookes and Barfoot (2010) estimated that in the 11 years from 1998 to 2008, the use of Bt cotton contributed an additional $21 million to farm income in South Africa.
The Makhathini Flats smallholder experience with Bt cotton has been hailed internationally as the first example of how modern biotechnology can benefit resource-poor farmers in Africa. There can be no doubt that the major- ity of Makhathini Flats farmers did indeed benefit from the introduction of Bt cotton. They were able to adopt and benefit from this new technology because all the institutional structures that facilitate a functioning market were in place at the time. These structures include functioning input markets (credit, seeds, and chemicals) and output markets (seed cotton buyer) that operate at market clearing prices. An important factor was that Vunisa was the only buyer and, because of this monopsony power, could supply production credit to farmers who did not own their land, using the forthcoming crop as collateral (Gouse, Shankar, and Thirtle 2008). This system is not uncommon to Africa, where widespread failure of credit and input markets (partly due to lack of land ownership that could serve as collateral) has led to interlocked transactions, in which a firm wishing to purchase the farm output—typically a ginner in the case of cotton—provides inputs to farmers on credit and attempts to recover the credit upon purchase of the product (Tschirley, Poulton, and Boughton 2006). However, when the credit system collapsed in 2002—because of farm- ers defaulting on their loans as a consequence of a combination of droughts, low prices (linked to the low and stagnated world cotton price), marginal prof- its, adverse selection, and market competition—the whole system collapsed, and cotton production dropped.
The Makhathini smallholder experience is indeed a good example for the rest of Africa, as countries considering adoption of Bt cotton need to take note that although technical solutions can help address problems (such as lack of knowledge regarding insects and pest control, limited access to inputs, or evolution in pest pressure), no technology (GM or otherwise) can resolve the fundamental institutional challenges of smallholders and agri- culture in Africa. The particular case of the Makhathini Flats and the wider story of cotton in South Africa emphasize that although all agricultural systems require adequate investment and appropriate technologies, their viability is determined by the policies and institutions that facilitate sustain- able and profitable production. Bt cotton and more recently stacked (Bt/ HT) varieties are still the varieties of choice for smallholder producers, but

SOCIOECONOMIC AND FARM-LEVEL EFFECTS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS 33
production levels have decreased drastically and remain limited mainly due to the relatively low price of cotton.
Bt Maize
Globally, in 2007 GM maize was planted on 35 million hectares, or 24 percent of world maize plantings, of which 9.3 million hectares was Bt as single trait and another 18.8 million hectares in combination with other traits ( James 2007). In 2010 GM maize covered 46.8 million hectares globally, and the area increased to 51 million hectares in 2011 ( James 2010, 2011). Bt maize was first introduced in the United States in 1996, and by 2006 it covered 40 per- cent or 12.7 million hectares of the total US maize crop. In Argentina, varieties containing the Bt trait were planted on 73 percent of the total Argentinean maize area, and in Spain it covered 54,000 hectares or 15 percent of the total maize area (Brookes and Barfoot 2008).
Maize is the most important field crop in South Africa and annually cov- ers an estimated 30 percent of the total arable land. Maize serves as staple food for the majority of the South African population and also as the main feedgrain for livestock. Between 60 and 70 percent of the South African yel- low maize production is consumed in the chicken-production sector. Over the past 9–10 years, South Africa produced an average of 9.3 million metric tons of maize on 2.75 million hectares.
Even though Bt yellow maize was released in 1998 for commercial pro- duction, GM white maize was commercialized only in 2001. That year, South Africa became the first country in the world to permit the commercial produc- tion of a GM subsistence crop—Bt white maize. In South Africa and other southern African countries, the losses sustained in maize crops due to damage caused by the African maize stem (stalk) borer (Busseola fusca) are estimated to be between 5 and 75 percent, and it is generally accepted that, pre-Bt, Busseola annually reduced the South African maize crop by an average of 10 percent (Annecke and Moran 1982). Gouse et al. (2005) showed that in 2005 with
a seemingly conservative estimate of 10 percent for damage caused by both Busseola fusca and Chilo partellus, the average annual loss (in the absence of Bt) adds up to just under a million tons of maize, with an approximate value
of ZAR810 million. At the 2008 maize price level (more or less similar to the 2011 price level), the potential damage caused by borers would be closer to ZAR1.6 billion (about $200 million). Both B. fusca and C. partellus can be controlled to a satisfactory level with the use of the Bt gene currently used in South African Bt varieties (Cry1Ac).

34 CHAPTER 1
As can be seen in Table 1.3, the initial spread of Bt maize was quite slow because of the scale-up time required to have a sufficient amount of seeds
and to have the Bt trait inserted in hybrids that were suitably adapted to local conditions. Approval for commercial release of herbicide tolerance came in 2002 and the stacked traits of Bt and HT in 2007. Compared to cotton, the decrease in Bt and HT maize since the introduction of stacked maize was less pronounced. Bt remains the most popular trait, partly because especially white stacked maize adoption has been hindered by inadequate seed availability. In the 2008/09 production season, GM maize covered 70 percent of the total South African maize area, with Bt maize covering 43 percent. In 2009/10 the Bt maize area increased by a further 269,000 hectares up to 48 percent, mainly stemming from a drop in the white stacked maize area because of inadequate seed supply.
Considering the adoption rates illustrated in Table 1.3, it is possible to con- clude that South African maize farmers have benefited from the introduction of GM maize. Similar to the indicated GM cotton adoption rates in Table 1.1, these GM maize adoption rates represent adoption by predominantly com- mercial farmers. There are no official smallholder GM maize adoption figures, but it is estimated that about 10,500 subsistence, smallholder, and emergent farmers (about 23 percent of the smaller farmers), buying hybrid seed from the three major seed companies, planted GM maize in 2007 (Gouse, Kirsten, and Van der Walt 2008). However, there are still areas in South Africa where small- holders plant mainly open-pollinated varieties and traditional/saved seed, and definitions of subsistence, smallholder, smallholder projects, and emerging farmers also complicate estimations. It can therefore be argued that the num- ber of smallholders planting GM maize is still relatively minimal.
Marra, Pardey, and Alston (2002) found that there were significant ben- efits to planting Bt maize in the United States through increased yields, even when it appeared as if borer infestation levels were not large enough to con- trol with insecticides. Marra, Carlson, and Hubbell (1998) reported that the use of Bt maize boosted yields by 4–8 percent, depending on location and year. Results from outside the United States show a similar pattern. In the Huesca region in Spain, Brookes (2002) reported a yield increase of 10 percent over conventional maize protected with pesticides and an increase of 15 per- cent when insecticides were not used. Other regions in Spain enjoyed an aver- age Bt yield advantage of 6.3 percent, with a range of 2.9–12.9 percent. James (2002) reported a 8–10 percent yield increase in Argentina up to 2004, and more recent studies show a 5–6 percent increase (Brookes and Barfoot 2008). Gonzales (2002) recorded a yield advantage of 41 percent for Bt maize on

field trials in the Philippines, and Philippine farmers indicated an even higher (60 percent) yield improvement. In most countries, the additional cost of the Bt technology has exceeded the savings on insecticides and thus has resulted in an increase in total production costs.
Compared to the number of studies and publications on Bt cotton in South Africa, the body of literature and the number of researchers follow-
ing the farm-level impacts of Bt maize in South Africa is rather limited. Even though there have been reports in the media quoting some anecdotal find- ings of some fairly unscientific studies, only a series of studies by the University of Pretoria2 have endeavored to follow the socioeconomic effects and perfor- mance of Bt maize for a number of seasons, mainly focusing on smallholders.
Gouse et al. (2005) found average yield increases (due to better stem borer control) of 10–11 percent for commercial (dryland and irrigation) farmers, whereas smallholder Bt adopters reported yield increases of 0–32 percent for the seven seasons 2001/02–2007/08 (Gouse et al. 2010). A statistically insignificant average yield increase of 12 percent was found across the seven seasons. In sea- sons with a low stem borer infestation, resulting in insignificant stalk borer dam- age, farmers planting Bt maize seed were in all likelihood worse off than farmers planting conventional hybrid maize because of the extra Bt technology fee. It is however difficult to make preplanting predictions on seasonal stalk borer infes- tation levels due to the complicated relationship between rainfall, variable sea- sons, growth of maize, effect of stalk borer on the maize plant, and the effect of natural enemies on the host (Annecke and Moran 1982). Because a dry early sea- son does not necessarily portend a dry season throughout, South African large- scale commercial farmers indicate that Bt serves as affordable insurance against unforeseeable stalk borer outbreaks, but increases in seed cost or technology fees could easily outstrip that insurance value to small-scale and subsistence farmers in South Africa (Gouse et al. 2006).
Gouse et al. (2006) endeavored to quantify the 16 percent yield increase, the average of the Bt yield advantage for two groups of farmers in north-
ern KwaZulu-Natal for the 2002/03 season, in subsistence-farmer terms.
For these smallholders a 16 percent yield increase meant only 110 kilo- grams of extra grain, and selling the extra grain would render a rather insig- nificant income advantage. However, arguing that the extra grain replaces potentially purchased, relatively more expensive, maize meal (flour), the yield

advantage seems more valuable. Alternatively, using a generally excepted rule- of-thumb stating that a rural household of seven members requires fourteen 80 kilogram bags of maize meal for a year to be food secure, the 16 percent yield advantage in 2002/03 resulted in approximately 36 more days of maize meal for the household. This is assuming, rather unrealistically, that there is no postharvest damage to harvested grain.
Insecticide use by maize-producing smallholders is limited, and Bt adoption consequently did not result in substantial insecticide savings. Bt adoption by commercial farmers has resulted in decreased expenditure on insecticides but, similar to what has been reported in other countries, generally not enough to cover the increased seed cost. Depending on the quantity
of seed purchased, Bt maize seed was 23–25 percent more expensive than conventional seed, and more recently those percentages have increased to about 27–30 percent.
Following the planting of HT maize demonstration plots in 2003/04 and 2004/05 in some smallholder areas where Bt had been introduced, a number of farmers adopted HT maize in 2005/06. Many farmers who planted Bt maize in previous years instead opted for HT seed (Gouse et al. 2010). Farmers indicated that compared to stem borers, weeds are a constant pest, and it would seem as if the labor-saving benefit of HT maize is valued higher than the insect control (yield) benefit of Bt. With a substantial share of the economically active, able-bodied population emigrating to urban areas in search of employment and a tragically high HIV/AIDS prevalence, especially in rural KwaZulu-Natal, labor has become a scarce commodity for many South African smallholder farmers. By using broad-spectrum herbicides before and after planting (some only after), as opposed to manual weeding with hand and hoe, farmers are able to save quite considerably on family labor person-days. For some of the seasons, HT maize also yielded more grain than conventional hybrid maize with manual weeding because of more effective weed control.
In some areas in KwaZulu-Natal, HT has totally replaced Bt. In an attempt to benefit from both the GM technologies, some smallholders purchased stacked Bt/HT maize, but others indicated this maize is too expensive and opted for HT only (Gouse et al. 2010). Stem borer pressure has been low during the study seasons, and it would be interesting to see how HT-adopting farmers react to possible higher borer levels in seasons to come.
Using yield increase, insecticide savings, and increased seed expenditure indications of mainly Gouse et al. (2005), Brookes and Barfoot (2010) esti- mated that between 2000 and 2008, Bt maize adoption increased adopt- ing farmers’ farm income by a total of $476 million. That is a productivity

increase–induced injection into the economy of ZAR3.67 billion over 9 years. To put this amount into context, over the past 10 years the South African Government has, through the platforms and initiatives created under the National Biotechnology Strategy (Republic of South Africa, Department of Science and Technology 2001), invested about ZAR900 million (Hanekom 2010) in biotechnology research and development.
Conclusion
Benefiting from a strong research background, South Africa was able to pro- actively develop guidelines and later legislation and regulations on the devel- opment and use of modern biotechnology and its applications such as GM crops. Development and implementation of a relatively dynamic GMO legisla- tion and underlying regulations have enabled South African farmers—and, to a lesser extent, consumers, through maize meal prices and health aspects (see Chapter 2)—to benefit from the first wave of GM crops.
Solely based on the high adoption levels of especially Bt cotton and maize by large-scale farmers, in the presence of available and less-expensive conven- tional seed varieties (including near isolines), it is possible to conclude that farmers benefited. Some peer-reviewed studies have shown that like large- scale farmers, smallholder cotton and maize farmers have also benefited, mainly through savings on insecticide applications and limitation of the dam- age caused by bollworms and stem borers.
Whereas Bt cotton saw a near 100 percent smallholder adoption rate in only a couple of years, adoption of Bt maize has been limited. There are a number
of reasons for this: in a vertically integrated production system where the input supplier also ensures an output market, adoption of a (early season) more expen- sive but productivity-increasing technology makes sense. However, smallholder maize farmers have to fund production inputs, and as many only produce on a subsistence level (in many cases surplus production depends on the season’s rain- fall), farmers are unable to directly recover their input expenditures. Contrary to cotton, for which bollworm pressure and damage seems to be more constant and severe, stem borer infestation levels (especially on dryland maize) vary signifi- cantly from season to season and across areas, and the damage level is generally lower than with cotton. Though very few smallholder maize farmers apply an insecticide to control stem borers on maize, the amount of labor and chemicals required to control borers is far less than what is required to control bollworms on cotton. Another factor that is sometimes not taken into consideration, espe- cially in the South African context, is that smallholder maize farmers’ reasons

SOCIOECONOMIC AND FARM-LEVEL EFFECTS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS 39
or motivation for maize production differ. In the production of a cash crop like cotton, farmers are profit driven and are intent on producing as much as possi- ble. On the contrary, some smallholder maize farmers are only interested in pro- ducing enough for their households, others only plant a couple of lines for fresh maize, and yet others only produce to sell. It is unlikely that the smaller produc- ers would invest in a productivity-increasing technology like Bt maize.
That a technology was introduced and adopted and that farmers benefited does not necessarily result in a flourishing sector, as is evident from the exam- ple of South African cotton. Even with biotechnology, South African cot-
ton farmers were not able to produce profitably at low cotton world prices. The fact that many smallholders continued producing, while commercial farmers left the sector for greener or more profitable pastures is indicative of smallholders’ dependence on government support and limited alternative pro- duction options and not of the success of biotechnology.
Bt seed technology is a production tool just like fertilizers, herbicides, or irrigation technologies. Contrary to the technologies of the Green Revolution, it might be able to improve the yields of farmers with limited ability or means to control insects. However, it will by no means be able to overcome institu- tional failure and governance challenges that seem to be endemic in African agriculture and that were also the limiting factors in the Green Revolution. The experience with Bt cotton on the Makhathini Flats emphasizes that technology-induced advances might be short lived in the absence of the cor- rect institutional structures, regulations, cooperation, and competition.

Bt Maize and Fumonisin Reduction in South Africa: Potential Health Impacts
Carl E. Pray, John P. Rheeder, Marnus Gouse, Yvette Volkwyn, Liana van der Westhuizen, and Gordon S. Shephard
Starting in the late 1940s, deaths from esophageal cancer (EC) rose dramatically in rural areas of the Transkei region of South Africa, which is part of the Eastern Cape Province (Rose and Fellingham
1981). And from the early to mid-1900s, maize was widely adopted, replac- ing sorghum (McCann 2005). From 1996 to 2000, regional EC incidence occurred at an age-standardized rate of 31.2/100,000 for males and 21.8/100,000 females—far higher than next-highest regional cancer inci- dences at the same time, which were lung cancer in men (6.2/100,000) and cervical cancer in women (19.0/100,000). In South Africa as a whole, the EC rate is 14.3/100,000. Globally, the EC rate is about 4/100,000 for women and 9/100,000 for men. Other hot spots for EC are found in China, Iran, and Zimbabwe (Somdyala et al. 2003).
In response to these developments, the government of South Africa estab- lished the first Transkei Oesophagus Cancer Study Group in 1975 to investi- gate this problem. This Study Group evolved into what is now the Programme on Mycotoxins and Experimental Carcinogenesis (PROMEC) at the Medical Research Council. Through extensive studies, scientists have established a sig- nificant correlation between EC and high levels of fumonisin, a mycotoxin produced by a maize fungus (Rheeder et al. 1992).
Evidence suggests that fumonisin exposure causes neural tube defects (NTDs) in human babies by disrupting the uptake of folate in cell lines (Marasas et al. 2004; Missmer et al. 2006). High levels of NTDs were found in a rural district of the Eastern Cape Province (610/100,000) and in rural areas of Limpopo Province (350/100,000), in contrast to about 10/100,000 in urban centers of South Africa (Marasas et al. 2004). High levels of NTDs are also found in those areas of China with high EC and high fumonisin levels. Animal models also link fumonisin with NTDs, but administration of folate partially reduced the mycotoxin’s impact (Gelineau–van Waes et al. 2005).
 43

44 CHAPTER 2
PROMEC has developed and tested a number of strategies to reduce con- sumers’ exposure to mycotoxins. These include food-preparation methods
to reduce the mycotoxin (Van der Westhuizen et al. 2010), regulatory stan- dards for maximum allowable exposure (Rheeder et al. 2009), measures for early detection of tumors (Venter 1995), and maize variety selection and breeding programs to develop cultivars with improved host resistance against Fusarium ear rot (Rheeder et al. 1990; Rheeder, Marasas, and Van Schalkwyk 1993). This last intervention seemed particularly promising, because such cultivars could be used in rural areas not closely linked to markets or govern- ment services.
Transgenic insect-resistant (Bt) maize has emerged as a potential way of reducing fumonisin exposure. Past conventional plant breeding in South Africa has done little to reduce susceptibility of maize to Fusarium, the fun- gus that produces fumonisin. Bt maize contains a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis that encodes for formation of a crystal protein toxic to common lepidopteran maize pests, which includes the maize stalk borer. Insect damage predisposes maize to mycotoxin contamination, because insects cre- ate kernel wounds that encourage fungal colonization, and insects themselves may serve as vectors of fungal spores (Sinha 1994; Wicklow 1994; Munkvold, Hellmich, and Rice 1999). Thus, methods that reduce insect damage in maize can also reduce risks of fungal contamination (Wu 2006).
This study examines the extent to which Bt hybrids could reduce myco- toxins at the village level. Although some studies have examined the impact
of Bt hybrids on fumonisins on experiment stations both outside and inside South Africa (for example, Munkvold, Hellmich, and Rice 1999; De la Campa et al. 2005; Rheeder et al. 2005), no studies have focused on small farmers’ fields. The plan of this study was to sample ears of Bt maize and conventional maize after harvest to measure fungus and mycotoxin levels found on these ears in the regions of the Eastern Cape, where major health problems due to mycotoxins are found, as well as in KwaZulu-Natal, where we were already sur- veying small farmers about their use of transgenic maize. Unfortunately, in one target region for the study in the Eastern Cape, Bt seed did not arrive in time for planting. In the other Eastern Cape location, the weather was so dry that virtually no maize was planted for several consecutive years. Hence, village- level results reported below are from KwaZulu-Natal alone.
A secondary study objective is to examine whether adoption of Bt maize seed in rural areas could reduce rural consumers’ exposure to mycotoxins to levels considered safe by the international health community.

BT MAIZE AND FUMONISIN REDUCTION IN SOUTH AFRICA 45
Background
Fumonisins are produced primarily by the fungi Fusarium verticillioides
and F. proliferatum.1 The former is an almost universal inhabitant of maize (Haliburton and Buck 1986). Fumonisins are a recently discovered class of mycotoxins produced by the fungi F. verticillioides (formerly F. moniliforme), F. proliferatum, and some related species (Rheeder, Marasas, and Vismer 2002). The disease in maize caused by these fungi is called Fusarium kernel rot. The first report implicating fumonisins in human disease was connected with high human EC rates in Transkei, South Africa, in 1992 (Rheeder et al. 1992). The following year, interest in these mycotoxins increased after unusu- ally high horse and swine death rates in the United States were linked to con- taminated feed (Marasas 1996).
Fumonisin causes toxic effects through its inhibition of ceramide synthase, an enzyme necessary for sphingolipid metabolism (Van der Westhuizen et al. 2008). It is positively associated with EC (Rheeder et al. 1992). Scientists have found similar patterns of high fumonisin concentrations in maize and high- incidence areas of EC in China (Chu and Li 1994). Additional risk factors associated with the development of EC are smoking and alcohol consumption. PROMEC’s hypothesis is that in South Africa the increase in EC is due in part to a major shift in cropping patterns from sorghum to maize in these areas and the associated rise in consumer exposure to fumonisins, which are particularly prevalent in maize.
Elevated levels of fumonisin in animal feed cause such diseases as equine leukoencephalomalacia (a disease of the central nervous system) and porcine pulmonary edema, heart failure, and liver damage in swine (Marasas et al. 1988; Kellerman et al. 1990; Ross et al. 1992; Wilson et al. 1992; US Food and Drug Administration 2001). Horses have been shown to exhibit neuro- logical symptoms suggestive of antemortem toxicity after feeding on grain containing 10.56 milligrams/kilogram total fumonisins for 92–122 days, and swine have exhibited liver injury at 23 milligrams/kilogram total fumonisins for 14 days (US Food and Drug Administration 2001). Fumonisin has
been shown to cause liver and kidney cancer in rats and liver cancer in mice (Gelderblom et al. 1991; Howard et al. 2001), as well as alterations in kidney function (Bondy et al. 1995; Voss et al. 1995).

evaluated fumonisins and allocated a group provisional maximum tolerable daily intake of 2 micrograms/kilogram body weight/day for FB1, FB2, and FB3, alone or in combination (Bolger et al. 2001). The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified FB1 as a Group 2B carcinogen, that is, possi- bly carcinogenic to humans (IARC 2002).
Maize flour is the basic starch in South Africa and makes up a large part
of all food consumed by people with limited resources. PROMEC’s recent survey of consumption patterns in Bizana and Centane in the Eastern Cape Province (Table 2.1) found that adults consumed from 335 to 483 grams of maize/person/day, or between 133 and 176 kilograms per year. In addition, the average consumer drank 32 milliliters/day of beer, and the average self- reported drinker had 1,048 milliliters/day. Beer is primarily made from moldy maize in Bizana and Centane, and hence has high fumonisin levels (Shephard et al. 2005).
The amount of fumonisin in the grain or beer in these regions is very high (Table 2.2). Fumonisin contamination levels are similar for grain

from large commercial farmers and good-quality grain of smallholder semi- subsistence farmers in low-EC areas (first and second rows in Table 2.2). However, fumonisin is much higher in grain milled in local mills than it is in maize meal or grits milled in commercial mills (rows labeled maize-based food in Table 2.2). Fumonisins are much lower in flour from commercial mills, because the commercial milling process removes the grain’s outer shell contain- ing most of the fumonisins.
The last two columns in Table 2.1 show how much fumonisins rural con- sumers eat. The penultimate column assumes that fumonisin levels are those for home-grown maize in the two regions and that all maize eaten is home grown. In recent years, these assumptions are clearly incorrect, as drought

conditions and other factors in some regions have severely limited local maize production in Centane. Whatever consumers are eating is from local stores and is not home grown. If we assume that the fumonisin level in flour is about 200 micrograms/kilogram, which is the level found in commercially milled maize flour, then the amounts consumed would be those shown in the last col- umn of Table 2.1.
Using the levels of fumonisin concentration from maize produced and con- sumed in villages, the average exposure in all groups is far above the 2 micro- grams/kilogram body weight/day that JECFA recommends as the safe upper limit of daily consumption. If all maize flour comes from commercial mills, the mean consumption by children is still 50 percent higher than the JECFA limit. Most other groups (last column in Table 2.1) consume fumonisin at about the JECFA limit, which implies that about half of consumers still take in more than the recommended amount. In South Africa, the Health Department, Medical Research Council, and other experts think that an upper limit of
1 microgram/kilogram body weight/day is a safer level under South African conditions. Most people in these areas consume more than this more restric- tive limit.
PROMEC and other organizations have attempted a number of technology and policy interventions over the years. Table 2.3 lists these interventions and indicates whether they were targeted at EC, NTDs, or other animal health prob- lems. Starting in late 1982, PROMEC has also operated a program to identify and encourage commercialization of fumonisin-resistant maize. If the trait could be worked into local farmers’ open pollinated varieties through government or public–private partnerships, farmers would not have to buy the seed every year, and expensive government seed supply systems would not be required.
The PROMEC program tested selected commercial hybrids starting in the late 1980s, growing them in Transkei in trials against the landraces (Rheeder 1995). Some showed some resistance, but they were not adapted to conditions in Transkei. As a result, they could not be adopted directly. Some improved lines were identified and turned over to the Agricultural Research Council (ARC). ARC did use these lines in breeding programs for a while but did not produce anything specifically for fumonisin resistance. One problem was that even if you could select cultivars that reduced the visible fungus, you did not necessarily reduce the fumonisin, because sometimes the fungus is not visible on the kernels (known as asymptomatic infection).
When transgenic plants became a possibility, PROMEC contacted private firms such as Pioneer Hi Bred in the United States, which had a research pro- gram to introduce genes to disrupt the fumonisin genes in the kernel that were

   responsible for producing the fumonisin. PROMEC then saw in the literature that Bt maize, developed to reduce losses from insect pests, also had signifi- cantly lower levels of fumonisin (Munkvold, Hellmich, and Rice 1999; Dowd 2001; Bakan et al. 2002; Hammond et al. 2003). When Monsanto introduced the Bt gene in South Africa, PROMEC initiated efforts to collaborate with the company to determine whether this technology could reduce mycotoxins in rural villages. The first test compared Bt hybrids with their isolines on ARC experiment stations, where conditions could be controlled. These were first run in 2001/02, with a second round in 2002/03. Results were mixed. In some years in some locations Bt maize had much lower levels of fumonisins than did conventional maize, but in other years or locations little difference was dis- cernable. However, on average Bt maize had 60 percent less fumonisin than conventional hybrids (Rheeder et al. 2005).
The government intervention, which this chapter examines, is the intro- duction and distribution of Bt maize seed to subsistence farmers. The

hypothesis is that Bt maize would control stalk borers, thus reducing fungus levels and concomitantly reducing levels of fumonisin in home-grown maize. Hybrid Bt maize seeds have spread widely in South Africa in recent years but are mainly used by commercial farmers rather than subsistence farmers in the Eastern Cape (see Chapter 1 for a discussion of the spread of GM maize in South Africa).
The introduction of Bt maize to small farms in the Eastern Cape is unlikely to take place without some government assistance, because seed companies would not find it profitable to serve smallholder farmers in these areas. The farmers are poor, do not buy seeds annually (see Table 2.4), and rarely use com- plementary inputs like fertilizer on their soil. Thus, either government exten- sion services must develop Bt hybrids for the region and provide these seeds
to farmers, or the government should subsidize private companies to provide these seeds.
Methods and Results of the Rockefeller Study
Maize samples were collected from farmers in three locations in the province of KwaZulu-Natal after harvest. Samples were taken in areas where we were also surveying the economic impact of Bt maize on farmers’ incomes. We con- tacted farmers in our sample who we knew were using Bt maize. In some cases when our contact farmers had already consumed or sold their Bt maize, we contacted their neighbors. Farmers identified the grain as Bt hybrids, non-
Bt hybrids, or local varieties. The number of samples varied between 50 and 80 maize samples each year.
The mycological analysis was conducted as follows. Briefly, subsamples
of kernels (80–100 grams) were surface sterilized for 1 minute in 3.5 per- cent commercial sodium hypochlorite solution and rinsed twice in sterile dis- tilled water. One hundred kernels (5 kernels/90 millimeter petri dish) were then transferred to malt extract agar (1.5 percent) containing novobiocin (150 milligrams/liter), and the agar plates were incubated at 25°C in the dark

for 5–7 days. All isolated fungi were recorded and identified according to their morphological characteristics on the agar plates.
Fumonisin level was determined as follows. Each sample was ground in
a laboratory mill to a fine meal and extracted with methanol:water (3:1) by homogenization. An aliquot was applied to a strong anion exchange solid- phase extraction cartridge, and the fumonisins were eluted with 1 percent acetic acid in methanol. The purified extracts were evaporated to dryness, redissolved in methanol, and derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde. The deriv- atized extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a Phenomenex Luna 5: C18(2) column and fluores- cence detection.
Statistical analysis was done on the mycology and fumonisin data using SPSS 13 software (Chicago, United States) to determine any significant differ- ences between the groups (that is, traditional, commercial, and Bt maize) of samples at the three locations. Analyses were conducted on the F. verticillioides + F. proliferatum (FvFp) and total fumonisin variables only, with natural log transformation of the latter variable.
The results of the village surveys (Table 2.5) show a clear advantage of Bt maize over conventional hybrids and traditional maize seed. Bt maize had 40 percent less fumonisin than did traditional cultivars. Relative to the non-Bt commercial maize hybrid, Bt maize had on average 16 percent less fumonisin.
The table also shows variability of fumonisin levels in different years and different locations. These differences may result from weather, other environ- mental factors, or hybrid characteristics. A recent study (De la Campa et al. 2005) of fumonisin in maize in fields managed by scientists rather than farm- ers in Argentina and the Philippines found that although the use of Bt maize explains much of the variation in fumonisin levels, location or weather explain more of the variation. In addition, levels of insect damage and use of different hybrids also explain the variation. Our data show similar results: on average Bt maize has less fumonisin, but levels vary because of weather and other factors. As noted in Table 2.5, in the first year in Hlabisa Bt hybrids had traits that attracted birds to eat kernels, which allowed the fungus that causes fumonisin to multiply rapidly and led to high levels of fumonisin.
These results can also be compared to those from South African experi- ment station studies conducted by PROMEC on ARC research stations Potchefstroom and Vaalharts in 2002 and 2003. These experiment stations are in the heart of the commercial maize-growing area of South Africa. These experiments compared commercial Bt hybrids with their isolines (identical

bCommercial maize includes nontransgenic and transgenic hybrids but without Bt genes.

hybrids except for the addition of Bt). As in the village studies, there was con- siderable diversity in results among different hybrids, different locations, and different years. The authors of this study (Rheeder et al. 2005, S88) con- cluded that “the incidence of fumonisin-producing Fusarium species, stalk borers (B. fusca), and levels of fumonisin, were generally lower in the Bt hybrids.” The fumonisin levels in the Bt hybrids were on average 51 percent lower than the non-Bt isoline at Potchefstroom in 2002, 83 percent lower at Potchefstroom in 2003, and 39 percent lower in Vaalharts in 2003.
Implications—How Much Could This Technology Reduce Mycotoxin Exposure?
If all farmers in the Eastern Cape shifted to Bt maize and obtained the same results as farmers in our sample in KwaZulu-Natal, would it reduce their intake of fumonisin to safe levels? To test this possibility, we simulated the

impact of reducing fumonisin levels by 62 percent using the data introduced in Table 2.1.
If Bt maize could be introduced into this area and adopted by 100 per- cent of farmers and if the reduction in fumonisin exposure due to Bt were the same as that found in the maize from KwaZulu-Natal villages (column 4 of Table 2.5), then there would be a dramatic reduction in fumonisin exposure (see Table 2.6). In Bizana, most groups of people except children would have lower exposure than the suggested maximum level of 2 micrograms/kilogram body weight/day. In Centane, however, all groups would still remain above the suggested level.
In fact, the combination of the declining production of maize in the area (which has forced families to eat more commercially milled maize) and a switch to Bt maize by those who continue to grow maize could reduce expo- sure dramatically. The only obvious way to reduce consumption to the level of 2 micrograms/kilogram body weight/day is by stopping consumption
of home-grown maize (see last column of Table 2.1) or through farmers’ adop- tion of a cultivar that completely disrupts the production of fumonisin in maize. Cultivars of this type are being developed in research programs at the

Danforth Center in St. Louis, MO, United States, but they are not in field tri- als in the United States or South Africa.
Other village-level options that PROMEC has explored include improved sorting and washing of maize kernels to remove fumonisin (Van der West- huizen et al. 2010), or new cooking techniques to reduce the consumption
of fumonisin. Washing grain for 10 minutes and grading it appear to be par- ticularly promising, reducing fumonisin in cooked food by 65 percent (Van der Westhuizen et al. 2010). The challenge with this option is getting the word out to resource-poor households and encouraging them to use this sim- ple food-preparation procedure.
Another possible intervention would be to supply more commercial grain, with lower fumonisin levels, to farmers through health and welfare programs. As Table 2.2 shows, shifting from local grain to commercially milled grain would substantially reduce exposure, but there could be a loss of consumer benefits if commercially milled grain is more expensive and consumers prefer the taste of their own grain.
Stricter regulations to ban the sale of grain with more than 1 ppm fumoni- sin might have an impact on urban consumers who buy maize in markets
but would not affect rural consumers who do not buy maize meal. To pre- vent NTDs, the government is requiring that all grain be fortified with folate. However, subsistence farmers cannot easily access folate supplements, and their diets do not naturally contain high folate levels. Finally, brush biopsies can be used for early detection of EC (Venter 1995). If detected early enough, tumor removal is usually a successful operation, but this is clearly the interven- tion of last resort.
Conclusions and Future Research
This study provides evidence that the adoption of Bt maize can reduce expo- sure of subsistence farmers in South Africa to the mycotoxin fumonisin. The spread of Bt maize could ameliorate but not solve the problem of fumonisin in human and animal diets. However, getting Bt maize seed to small farmers in the Eastern Cape would be a major undertaking. Farmers are not using hybrids in these areas. They are instead using relatively well-adapted open pollinated varieties, and they save their own seed. Even with the good will of a major seed company, we were not able to get seed of existing Bt hybrids out to farmers so that they could test it. To establish widespread acceptance of Bt cultivars, some organization would have to either breed open pollinated varieties that are well adapted to this area or provide well-adapted hybrids every year or two. ARC

BT MAIZE AND FUMONISIN REDUCTION IN SOUTH AFRICA 55
has participatory breeding programs in some areas of South Africa that could be used for this purpose, but so far ARC is not doing participatory breeding for reduced fumonisin or using Bt lines. The extension system is very limited in what it can do. Farmers in some of these areas have almost given up plant- ing maize.
Changes in eating habits to use more commercial maize meal and the increasing use of rice and vegetables have already helped reduce fumonisin exposure. These changes seem to be due to a combination of higher welfare payments (which may have allowed some families to buy more grain) and also to poor rainfall (which has led to lower production of maize). None of these were policies to improve diets and when taken in combination with urban- ization (which has increased the availability and status of “fast foods”), the diets of the poor may well have reduced fumonisin levels but at the same time become considerably less healthy.
Currently, the government of South Africa and the provincial governments clearly have their hands full with HIV/AIDS. However, if the government does decide to attack EC, a thorough evaluation of the efficacy of the various options available to reduce exposure to fumonisin is needed, and then a serious study of the costs of the different types of interventions must be conducted.

Genetically Modified Cotton in Uganda: An Ex Ante Evaluation
Daniela Horna, Patricia Zambrano, José Falck-Zepeda, Theresa Sengooba, and Miriam Kyotalimye
The Ugandan government has recognized the need to increase the per- formance of cotton and the potential of crop biotechnologies, particu- larly the role of genetically modified (GM) varieties to improve cotton production and thus the economy in general. In 2008, the National Biosafety Committee of Uganda approved the guidelines for implementing con-
fined trials, which enabled testing the environmental safety and performance of insect-resistant (Bt) and herbicide-tolerant (HT) cotton varieties. The implementation of the confined trials started in May 2009.
The release into the environment and eventual commercialization of GM cotton seed may raise questions about the socioeconomic impact of this tech- nology for Ugandan farmers. The economic impact of GM technologies can be assessed at different levels. The objective of this study is to provide an ex ante evaluation of the potential impact of GM cotton adoption in Uganda
at the farm level.1 To understand the context of this evaluation, we briefly review the literature available on ex ante evaluations of GM crops in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA). Next we describe the cotton value chain in Uganda and explain the main production systems. In the third section, we present the methodological approach used in the study to compare the profitability of the different cotton production alternatives. Finally, we present our main findings, conclusions, and policy recommendations and examine further considerations for evaluating the potential impact of GM cotton in Uganda.
1 This study was part of a multilevel evaluation carried out in 2007 with the support of the Program for Biosafety Systems. A full report of the project findings can be found in the forthcoming IFPRI book Socioeconomic Considerations in Biosafety Decisionmaking: Methods and Implementation.

62 CHAPTER 3
Ex Ante Impact of GM Crops in SSA
The adoption of GM varieties worldwide has expanded considerably since they were first commercialized in 1996. Originally only four countries approved the adoption and use of transgenic crops covering an area of just above 11 million hectares. In the case of cotton, GM varieties have been com- mercialized in 10 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Mexico, South Africa, the United States, and most recently, Burkina Faso. In parallel, the areas of non-GM conventional cotton have been decreas- ing in favor of Bt and HT cotton. James (2011) estimates that in 2011, more than 68 percent of world cotton was planted to GM varieties, including
both open-pollinated varieties and hybrids.
In 2009 the International Food Policy Research Institute published a
review of the economic impact of these crops in developing economies and the methods used to evaluate this impact (Smale et al. 2009). The review revealed that very few studies have addressed the potential or actual impact of GM crops on smallholders in SSA. Aside from numerous publications of the actual impact of Bt cotton and Bt maize in South Africa, the number of ex ante eval- uations is still limited in Africa. In East Africa De Groote et al. (2003) evalu- ated the potential for Bt maize; Edmeades and Smale (2006) discussed the potential impact of a GM banana on smallholder farmers in the Uganda high- lands. In West Africa, Horna et al. (2008) assessed ex ante GM vegetables in Ghana. More recently Vitale at al. (2008, 2010) have documented the impact of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso.
Given the importance of cotton in SSA and the availability of the technology, most of the ex ante evaluations have concentrated on GM cotton, especially Bt cotton. In West Africa for instance, Cabanilla, Abdoulaye, and Sanders (2005) developed a linear-programming model
to assess the potential cost to West Africa, Mali in particular, of not adopting Bt cotton. Elbehri and MacDonald (2004) and Langyintuo
and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2006) have carried out evaluations mainly based on trade models. Most recently, a study by Falck-Zepeda, Horna, and Smale (2008) examined the potential of Bt cotton for the West Africa region with emphasis on Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, and Togo using an eco- nomic surplus approach.
These studies conclude that there would be significant losses in economic benefits if Bt cotton is not adopted. Several of these studies also point to important institutional issues as significant determinants of the level and social distribution of benefits. A key institutional issue seems to be the decision

about the technology development, whether it will be imported, adapted, or generally adopted (Cabanilla, Abdoulaye, and Sanders 2005; Falck-Zepeda, Horna, and Smale 2008). The technology fee (price charged to farmers) is also a cross-cutting issue that will determine the potential benefits of GM technol- ogies in developing economies (Smale et al. 2009). Another critical issue is the ability of the innovator or the technology-transfer agent to transmit to farm- ers the necessary knowledge to manage the technology under field conditions. As concluded by Falck-Zepeda et al. (2008), GM technologies need to be part of a broad, integrated pest-management—or better yet, an integrated crop- management—strategy for implementation in SSA.
The Ugandan Cotton Sector
The history of cotton in Uganda is well documented in the literature (You and Chamberlin 2004; Cotton Development Organisation 2006; Baffes 2009; Tschirley, Poulton, and Labaste 2009). The long tradition of cotton cultivation gives the crop a historic significance. Cotton was introduced
to the central region of Uganda in about 1903, and over the years it has spread to the rest of the country. In the 1950s cotton and coffee became— and up to 1970 they remained—the most important sources of revenue for the government.
Several studies have noted that cotton has the potential to improve the welfare of about 250,000 low-income farming households (Gordon and Goodland 2000; Baffes 2009). At the aggregate national level, however, cot- ton constitutes just 2.2 percent of all crop production and thus plays a rela- tively small part in rural livelihoods (You and Chamberlin 2004). From a trade point of view, cotton ranks third among agricultural commodities exported, although it only accounts for 2–5 percent of Ugandan total exports (Serunjogi et al. 2001). In 2007 cotton exports were valued at 36 million US dollars with Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and the United Kingdom gen- erating more than 80 percent of these revenues (ICAC 2008; FAO 2010). All organic cotton is exported to the EU, mainly Switzerland. The local indus-
try consumes approximately 7–10 percent of the lint produced (ACE 2006; Uganda 2007).
Cotton is widely cultivated in more than 30 districts across the country (see Figure 3.1) because of the favorable agroclimatic conditions (You and Chamberlin 2004). The most important producing areas are located in the northern and western regions of Uganda.

66 CHAPTER 3
Seed Value Chain
The cotton value chain depends on the availability and the quality of seeds. Ugandan production is characterized by the use of only one seed variety avail- able for both conventional and organic planting, the Bukalasa Pedigree Albar. The one-seed policy has been promoted as a way to guarantee quality homog- enization. From the postharvest and marketing perspective, this is an advan- tage, because a single variety ensures uniformity in the production of lint and yarn. The dependence on a single variety, however, increases the vulnerability to pests and diseases and represents a potential risk.
The main actors in the cotton seed chain in Uganda are the cotton pro- ducers, the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) of Uganda, the Cotton Development Organisation (CDO), and some private ginneries. NARO2 coordinates and oversees all aspects of agricultural research in Uganda; it is in charge of cotton research breeding and technology development. According to ACE (2006), its breeding work had led to increased yields (from 740–1,230 kilograms/hectare to 3,700–5,000 kilograms/hectare currently) and enhanced ginning turnout (from 33 percent up to 37 percent in areas of high fertility).
However, the multiplication and seed-distribution process needs more atten- tion. The basic cotton seed is developed by NARO but multiplied by CDO and mainly distributed to the ginneries for commercial multiplication and distribu- tion to farmers. The seed that farmers use is entirely channeled through the gin- neries, NARO, and CDO. The CDO3 regulates, coordinates, and promotes
all aspects of the cotton subsector in Uganda. CDO also monitors cotton pro- duction and marketing and provides policy advice regarding the crop (Cotton Development Organisation 2006). CDO is therefore responsible for delinting, grading, and dressing all seed that will be given to ginneries for distribution. The seed is distributed free of charge to farmers.4
Availability of cotton seed is a limiting constraint for improving cotton productivity in Uganda. The need for improved varieties and certified seed is probably the most important constraint encountered in cotton produc- tion (Serunjogi et al. 2001). According to the Uganda Export Promotion Board (UEPB 2007), cotton exports in 2006 fell 29 percent compared to the

previous year. Among other factors, the low performance in 2006 was related to late planting, but mainly to the use of ungraded fuzzy (not delineated) seed, leading to high seed wastage and increased cost of provision of planting seed.
Given the existing limitations in the seed value chain, the introduction of GM seed in this system needs to be carefully thought out. First, the one-variety policy would probably need to be changed. The possibility exists that the devel- opers may not introduce the GM trait into the local variety, as it may not be part of their marketing and product diffusion strategy. Alternatively, developers may have improved varieties suited to the area. The participation of the public and private sectors in seed multiplication and distribution has to be discussed up- front. Would the technology developer be in charge of seed distribution? Is the government interested in negotiating a good price for cotton producers?
The technology fee is another critical aspect that needs to be carefully discussed. The development of GM seed for Uganda represents a signifi- cant investment that must be paid for. It is quite likely that GM seed will not be delivered free of charge, as has been the case in most adopting countries. It is possible that the government of Uganda would assume part of the cost, but it can also be expected that farmers will need to pay for the technology. For resource-poor farmers the big incentive to adopt a technology is often a guaranteed profit, especially for a cash crop like cotton.
Product Value Chain
Farmers, intermediate agents, and ginners/exporters are the main actors in the product value chain. As mentioned above, farmers obtain the seed from the ginners. Ginners traditionally provide farmers with fertilizers and pesticides. Farmers pay back at harvest with either cotton or cash. The level of inputs used is still limited, however, and often farmers decide to plant cotton only because of the secure market and fixed price. In the northern part of the country there are few alternatives to cotton, either as a single crop or as part of a rotation.
At harvest, farmers can take their production to the ginneries, but often the volume produced is so small it does not justify paying for transport. Most com- monly, intermediary agents gather the production of several farmers and take
it to the ginneries. Intermediary agents can either work for the ginnery or be independent. There are more than 50 ginneries distributed all over the coun- try. Thirty-one different companies privately own the ginneries. Given the irreg- ular cotton production, ginneries compete for access to cotton areas, as most ginneries operate below their potential capacity, although the operating gin- ning machines are of poor quality. In most cases, ginneries are active only during the harvest period. Although cotton production in Uganda does not cover the
GENETICALLY MODIFIED COTTON IN UGANDA 67

ginning potential and most companies work with excess capacity, most machines are rather old, and the quality of the turnout is low. An increase in overall cot- ton production can favor individual actors (producers, ginners, and government) and thus the economy in general. If the introduction of GM cotton boosted cot- ton yields, as expected, ginnery operations would therefore increase.
The challenging part from the standpoint of marketing channels will be devising ways to keep GM cotton from mixing with conventional varieties, or even worse, with organic cotton. However, in Uganda organic lint is already separated from conventional lint by using different ginneries for the two types. After separation of cotton seed from cotton lint, organic and conventional seeds are pooled together. The recycled seeds go back to ginneries, which deliver them to the farmers (see Figure 3.2). Under the current organization of the seed value chain, this might not be a problem, as both the organic produc- ers and the biotech companies have clear incentives to separate GM seed from other seeds. For producers and ginneries, it would be important to keep seeds used for organic production from mixing with GM seeds, and biotech compa- nies would avoid free recycling of the seed.
Cotton Production Systems
TRADITIONAL SYSTEM
Cotton in Uganda is grown under rainfed conditions largely by smallhold-
ers (Gordon and Goodland 2000). As a rainfed system, cotton production is dependent on rainfall patterns. Climatic events, especially variability in pre- cipitation, can severely affect cotton yields. The timeliness of the precipita- tion can determine a good or bad year for the crop. Production therefore varies considerably among the years. In the 2006/07 season for instance, rains were not timely, some areas were hit by hailstorms during crucial stages, and in other regions there was not enough moisture in the soil for boll formation. During that season, Uganda produced 75,000 metric tons5 of seed cotton, recording an average yield of just 483 kilograms/hectare (FAO 2010). This production resulted in a total of 24,790 tons of lint (Cotton Development Organisation 2008). Even though the area cultivated increased from 100,000 hectares in 2005/06 to 150,000 hectares in 2006/07, yields declined in the same period. In the 2007/08 season there was a sharp decline in total cotton production. Total lint produced was only 12,303 tons, merely 65 percent of the total pro- duced in the previous season.
 5 All tons are metric tons in the chapter.

Although climatic events can considerably affect cotton performance, institutional factors are also crucial determinants of the low output and high variability. The productivity of cotton in Uganda is below international and regional averages, even though in the past years seed cotton yields have regis- tered their highest records since 1960.6 CDO acknowledges the limited avail- ability of high-quality inputs, including seed, extension, and credit, as the major reason for the poor performance of the cotton subsector. Not only are inputs expensive or unaffordable for small producers, but their availability is also limited. Access to production inputs like fertilizers or high-quality seed is difficult to predict. Usually, the cotton season starts when seeds are made available to farmers by ginneries. Given the vertical integration and articula- tion of the chain, it is not uncommon that delays in the delivery of seed and other inputs occur. This situation was particularly severe for the 2007/08 sea- son, when the ginneries dropped their production support program (Cotton Development Organisation 2008).
ORGANIC SYSTEM
Uganda and Tanzania are the first organic cotton producers in the African continent (Moseley and Gray 2008). In Uganda, organic cotton production started in about 1994 (Ogwang, Sekamatte, and Tindyebwa 2005) when the Export Promotion of Organic Product from Africa began the Lango Organic Project in Lira and Apac districts. The project was promoted by a Dutch trader in organic textiles (Bo Weevil BV), and it was established as a business- oriented enterprise (Tulip and Ton 2002). By 2004 there were almost
38,000 certified organic farmers in Uganda, almost one-third of them produc- ing cotton (Taylor 2006).
In Lango, cotton is produced in rotation with sesame, an oilseed crop that commands a much higher productivity and market price compared to cot- ton. Farmers do not have many alternatives to cotton in this rotation system. In general, productivity of cotton in the northern region is considerably lower in the northernmost districts. In theory, organic ginneries buy the cotton from farmers at a premium price, but after discounting for the transport and gin- ning services, this premium price is not actually realized by the organic farmer. Dunavant is the only company that has certified organic ginneries. Other organic ginneries, namely Copcot and Lango Cooperative Union, segregate areas for organic production, according to their needs.
6 According to FAOSTAT, cotton seed yield in 2009 was greater than 900 kilograms/hectare (FAO 2010).
GENETICALLY MODIFIED COTTON IN UGANDA 69
 
70 CHAPTER 3
Table 3.1 shows the rapid expansion of organic cotton production since 2000. From 2000 to 2006, organic cotton production expanded at an average rate of 2 percent. This rate increased to 9 percent in the 2006/07 season. The main reasons for this positive trend were the growing interest of farmers in a crop system that requires lower use of often unaffordable inputs and the possibility of obtaining a premium price for their product. In the most recent season that we have information about (2007/08), the production share of organic cotton was even higher (20 percent), showing a still-growing interest in the organic system.
The main concern related to potential GM cotton introduction and adop- tion in Uganda is the coexistence of an organic system with a conventional system that is using GM seed. The positions of the government and of CDO toward organic production are not completely clear. In a way, the political sup- port for this production system needs to be clarified before GM is introduced. Coexistence is possible, but the steps to support this coexistence have to be designed and implemented ahead of GM introduction to avoid contamination and thus damage to organic cotton exports.
Methodology
The evaluation of the potential impact of GM cotton seed in Uganda was done using partial budgets and stochastic analysis. Given that GM cotton has not yet been planted in Uganda, the study was based on assumptions about specific variables that determine cotton profitability, such as GM prices and adoption rates. These assumptions, summarized in Table 3.2, are crucial to the

results of the economic evaluation. The use of different scenarios based on the variability of these assumptions gives an idea of the scope of their impact. Few studies have explicitly recognized the year-to-year variability in farm profits by applying stochastic approaches (Pemsl, Waibel, and Orphal 2004; Hareau, Mills, and Norton 2006) that we address in this study.
Survey Instrument
A survey instrument was implemented to collect information on cotton pro- duction and current practices used. In addition to input use and production questions, the survey elicited information on subjective yield distributions from growers to gauge farmers’ perceptions of the extent of yield losses caused by bollworms and by weeds. Farmers provided information on: (1) cotton yield without the constraint, (2) cotton yield with the constraint without using insecticides, and (3) cotton yield with the constraint and chemical con- trol of the pest. We elicited low, mode, and high values from farmers. Each yield parameter (minimum, maximum, and mode) was used to assess variabil- ity both within and across observations.
The survey information enabled (1) calculation of partial budgets for rep- resentative growers and (2) simulation of partial budgets for various scenarios, including use of varieties that are genetically resistant to bollworm attacks and some other Lepidoptera pests and tolerant to herbicide applications.
Data Collection, Sites, and Sampling
Lira and Kasese are the districts where the GM confined trials have been imple- mented, and they are also the districts selected for evaluating the current cotton production systems and conducting our household interviews. After identify- ing cotton-producing districts, we randomly selected villages with farmers crop- ping cotton in the 2006 and 2007 seasons, three in Lira and seven in Kasese. The distribution of villages followed the proportion of cotton produced in the areas, but it also was intended to give a good representation of organic producers.
A total of 150 household heads were interviewed, 48 in Lira and 102 in Kasese. The households were randomly selected from the list of producers pro- vided by ginneries operating in each region. This was the most complete list
of cotton producers that we could access. Given the nature of the crop and the vertical integration of the system, all cotton producers need to sell their output to a ginnery. The questions were addressed for the 2007 campaign, and some additional recall information was collected for 2006. In some cases, selected producers cultivated more than one plot, but most of them only managed one plot of cotton. The information was analyzed per plot for the 2007 season

only. Plots with incomplete information were not considered in the analy- sis. Thus, the total number of observations in our analysis ended up being 151 plots managed by 129 farmers. Of this total, 35 were plots from 32 pro- ducers located in Lira with only 12 real organic producers,7 and the rest were plots from producers located in Kasese.
Stochastic Budget Analysis
We used basic partial budget analysis augmented with stochastic simulations to evaluate cotton profitability across different scenarios. The scenarios evalu- ated included (1) a conventional cotton producer, (2) an organic cotton pro- ducer, (3) a conventional producer using Bt cotton seed, (4) a conventional producer using HR cotton seed, and (5) a hypothetical case where an organic cotton producer is using a GM seed. Additionally, we artificially classified pro- ducers as “low input” and “high input” to get some insights about the effect of higher input use on cotton performance (see appendix tables 3A.1–3A.5 for details on the descriptive variables used).8 Fertilizer use was considered as a cri- terion to classify high-input producers. Obviously, this classification is also a proxy for income level. Therefore, the category “high-input producers” refers to farmers who use chemical fertilizers and above-average amounts of pesti- cides in our sample. From a total number of 151 observations, only 27 quali- fied as high-input users.
The survey provided information to estimate input use and their costs and derive the partial budgets. The basis for calculating the partial budgets was the comprehensive guide produced by CIMMYT (1988). Cotton seed is distrib- uted free of charge, and thus the value is zero for the producer. This informa- tion was used for the partial budgets of the conventional, organic, high-input, and low-input producers. For the simulated scenarios, we imputed seed costs based on the farmgate price of the cotton seed. Total use of chemical and organic fertilizers and pesticides was reported by farmers and converted to val- ues per hectare. The value of the land was the equivalent of renting it. Average wages paid to hired labor were used to estimate the total family labor costs. This assumption seems reasonable in the production areas studied, where labor markets are active and farmers produce the crops commercially. Male and female labor days were valued equally. Using this information, we estimated
7 When analyzing the data, we noticed that several farmers who called themselves organic cotton producers were using insecticides and chemical fertilizers; therefore, the number of organic pro- ducers dropped considerably.

expected total income, total cost, expected net income, marginal benefit, and benefit/cost ratio for each of the five scenarios.
To introduce variability in the partial budgets, the study used @Risk soft- ware (Palisade Corporation, www.palisade.com/risk/) to estimate candidate distributions for each input variable. Note that in @Risk language, there are two kinds of variables: input variables, which are predetermined, and output variables, which are estimated based on the input variables. @Risk selected
a best-fit distribution for input variables feasible to be obtained from farmers using the survey instrument. For input variables with limited or no informa- tion, we used triangular distributions, defined by low, mode, and high values. The triangular distribution is the simplest distribution to elicit from farm- ers, it approximates the normal distribution, and it is especially useful in cases where no sample data are available (Hardaker et al. 2004). For generation of the variable parameters (low, mode, and high values), we assumed values gen- erated by expert consultation or literature review.
Input variables generated using survey information were yield, output price, pesticide use/cost, herbicide use/cost, and spraying cost (mainly labor). Input variables adjusted to triangular distributions were technology efficiency (trait expression), the technology fee, reduction rates in pesticide use, reduction rates in spraying costs in the case of Bt cotton, and increase rates in herbicide use for the case of HT cotton. Details on the minimum, mode, and maximum values adopted for these variables are reported in Table 3.2.
The @Risk software used the input variables to predict the distribution of the selected output variable (marginal benefit). In this way we not only compare marginal benefits across scenarios but also determine how sensitive the output variable is to changes in each input variable (within a scenario). A tornado graph is used to express the relative impact of a particular input parameter to the output from the simulations. The @Risk program regresses each output variable, in this case marginal benefits, to each of the param- eters included in the simulation with a probability distribution. The result- ing parameter gives an indication of the relative strength of the relationship between parameters and outcome.
Is Cotton Profitable?
Basic statistics of the household and production characteristics of interviewed farmers are presented in Table 3.3. In terms of cotton seed yield, aggregated values are higher than national averages for 2007 (FAO 2010), indicating some selection bias in the sampling.

76 CHAPTER 3
Sample statistics show that household characteristics are comparable across districts, but some production variables behave significantly differently. The age of the household head, level of education, household size, and household composition are similar across sites. Neither is there any significant variation concerning land value, labor use, and years of experience in cotton cultivation. The average farmer interviewed had more than 14 years’ experience working on cotton.
The size of the cotton plot tends to be larger in Kasese. Similarly, seed cotton yield and total benefits generated from cotton production are also higher in Kasese. In contrast, it seems that bollworm infestation levels are higher in Kasese than in Lira, implying that Bt cotton could have a higher success in the Western than in the Northern region. In either case, chemi- cal pesticides are not significantly reducing damage caused by pests or weeds (see Appendix C). A mean comparison of basic statistics between the two districts shows a significant difference in farmers’ experiences in cotton pro- duction (Table 3.3).
Another person besides the household head can manage a cotton plot. So, although the percentage of female household heads in our sample is low (3 percent in Lira and 9 percent in Kasese), the share of plots managed by women can be as high as 50 percent in Kasese and 29 percent in Lira. Nevertheless, when tested for mean differences between plots managed by men or women, none of the variables analyzed behaved significantly differ- ently (Table 3.4).
Traditional Production
The survey data analysis shows that most of the farmers are low-input users (Table 3.5). Some farmers use some type of chemical control to deal with insect pests, but relatively few make use of fertilizers, and almost none of them use herbicides. Cotton is a labor-intensive crop: labor represents more than 50 percent of the total production costs. Labor is primarily used for manual weeding. Weed infestation is therefore another serious constraint in cotton production. In our sample, weeding represents more than 20 percent of the total input costs for both types of producers. Other institutions work- ing in cotton in the area report similar patterns (Agricultural Productivity Enhancement Program, pers. comm., 2008). Results do not confirm the general belief that women mainly handle weeding. In any case, cotton is
a labor-consuming activity, and weeding is particularly labor demanding. So, freeing labor from weeding could allow family members to be available for other economic activities. However, the use of HT seed could have a

negative impact on employment and welfare in the community if there are not many off-farm labor opportunities. Almost all the farmers make use of hired labor.
Productivity of seed cotton for our sample, 386 kilograms/acre (or about 800 kilograms/hectare), is above the reported national average in 2007
(400 kilograms/hectare) but is lower than the average yield registered in 2009.9
On average, bollworms can reduce expected output by more than 70 per- cent. These estimations are based on farmers’ perceptions and may have an upward bias, but they are a good reference to understand the severity of boll- worm infestation in these regions. In addition to bollworms, there are other common biotic stresses, such as aphids, Lygus spp. (a sucking insect), and cot- ton stainers. These biotic constraints combined with high price variability

and the unreliable availability of inputs make cotton production a very risky activity in Uganda. The estimated downside risk—the risk of not being able to cover at least the production cost—for surveyed farmers was more than 40 percent.
Looking at the main cost components, it is evident that farmers invest very little in fertilization. Most of the producers interviewed belong to the cat- egory “low-input producers,” and although they do use pesticides to control for Lepidoptera and other major pests (Lygus spp., Aphis, and so forth), the amount of pesticide used is well below standard recommendations. In contrast, “high-input producers” reported not only higher yields but also higher prices paid for their cotton.

Organic versus Conventional Production
The main purpose for implementing the household survey in Lira was to cover a representative number of organic producers and generate a standard partial budget for an average organic cotton producer. However, only 12 of 35 pro- ducers interviewed complied with the standards of organic production. The rest of the producers admitted using some level of chemical control to deal with heavy pest infestations. In fact, the number of organic farmers in Uganda changes from year to year, as farmers appear to switch from conventional to organic with relative freedom. According to Dunavant representatives, in the 2006/07 season, 11,691 organic farmers were registered and contracted for a total production of 6,600 bales, which accounted for almost one-third of the total production of this company. The number of organic producers, however, dropped significantly during the 2008/09 season (see Table 3.1), as there were serious problems with army bollworms that infested the organic fields. During field observations, it became clear that organic farmers were so concerned about pest attacks that many applied pesticides even if they were not supposed to. Statistical analysis over this small sample of producers would obviously not render meaningful results, but the analysis of the household surveys can still provide some useful insights.
As for any other organic crop, cotton requires a significant amount of labor for manual activities, including insect and weed control. In our sample, labor use represented more than 60 percent of the total cost of production for organic cotton producers, and about one-third of that was labor used in manual weeding. Surveyed farmers reported that the damage caused by boll- worms was more than 50 percent, which is comparatively lower than the reported 76 percent for conventional producers. This difference could be because organic producers do manual control of bollworms, an activity that is quite labor demanding but more effective than the sporadic application of pesticides. Approximately 12 percent of the total investment of conventional producers was on chemical pesticides, whereas organic producers only spent 2 percent on organic pesticides. Organic pesticides include the use of neem extract and other nonchemical applications.
Given these management practices, conventional producers recorded
17 percent margins, whereas organic producers had 5 percent. It is well known that the productivity of organic cotton is lower than that of conventional pro- duction (Ogwang, Sekamatte, and Tindyebwa 2005). This low productivity is somehow compensated for by a price premium that the organic producers get for their output. Yet the organic cotton farmers interviewed were not getting

80 CHAPTER 3
these price premiums, as the prices reported were comparable to those received by conventional producers. Not only was the profitability of cotton low for both types of producers, but the crop also showed a high downside risk. In the case of organic farming, the downside risk for the 12 farmers interviewed was higher than 50 percent, and for conventional producers it was about 39 per- cent (Table 3.6).

GM Cotton
The use of GM seed was simulated in three scenarios (Table 3.7): Bt cot- ton, HT cotton, and organic cotton plus Bt cotton. Despite the seed- technology advantage, the profitability of cotton production was still very low for all these scenarios but higher than the situation with no technologi- cal change.
The use of GM seed may reduce the downside risk, but this depends on the effectiveness of the technology to control the constraint (e.g., the expression of the trait). An expert from the CDO (D. Lubwana, agronomist with CDO, pers. comm., 2007) reported that yield losses due to bollworms can be as high as 80 percent, which is in agreement with what farmers reported in the sur- vey (on average, about 76 percent). Given these high values, and farmers’ per- ceptions of yield losses due to bollworm attacks and weed infestation, it is not surprising that the margins are higher for both the Bt and the HT cotton sce- narios. Perceptions, however, are usually biased upward, given that it is rather difficult for farmers to isolate the effect of one constraint. The marginal ben- efits of using GM seed are directly related to the level of incidence of the pro- ductivity constraint and the actual damage caused by the biotic constraint.
The HT scenario recorded the highest benefit/cost ratio and the high-
est marginal rate of return of all the likely scenarios.10 The explanation for this result lies in the assumptions used for simulating this scenario. As mentioned earlier, weeding is a labor-intensive activity that needs to be performed regu- larly in a cotton field. Failure to weed has a severe impact on the final yields. Unfortunately, the lack of technical information about weed infestation and weed control in cotton production in Uganda is a major constraint on the model. Thus, the assumptions for this scenario are based on expectations rather than on technical information. In comparison, the impact of Bt cotton has been more thoroughly documented, and there is more information to sup- port the assumptions behind this scenario.
It is important to point out here that a higher yield would probably demand higher labor for agricultural practices, mainly for harvesting. Thus, the margins of all the simulated scenarios are likely to be overestimated. We do not have enough technical information to support more specific assumptions about the potential increase in labor costs, as there can be many factors affect- ing labor use. For instance, if we assume that the labor used for harvesting is proportional to yield increases, we may be overlooking the fact that labor may
10 Given the controversy between organic system proponents and GM technology supporters, the organic plus GM seed scenario is quite unlikely to be implemented.
GENETICALLY MODIFIED COTTON IN UGANDA 81
 
82 CHAPTER 3
not be readily available at the critical times or that the household may not have enough financial resources to hire more labor. As shown in Table 3.7, yield increases imputed to GM seed are basically due to the combination of damage- control effects and the technology efficiency, which could be used to represent the upper bound of additional labor used for harvesting under perfect correla- tion. Taking the average values shown in Table 3.7, Bt cotton reports the high- est reduction in marginal benefits (about 30 percent) whereas the organic plus Bt scenario reports the lowest reduction (13 percent). In other words, if the producer uses mainly hired labor, the practice will definitely have an impact on the margins. This type of producer will also invest in other complementary inputs that will contribute to an even better performance of the variety, and thus compensate for the additional investment.
Figure 3.3 presents a graphical analysis of the marginal benefits for all five scenarios evaluated. The distribution of marginal benefits is represented in the histogram, and the tornado graph summarizes the relative impact of a particu- lar input variable on these margins.11 For all scenarios the variability in yield and the high labor costs are the main determinants of the margins generated. A technology that contributes to reduce this yield variability would definitely have an impact on farmers’ welfare.
Conclusions and Policy Recommendations
This study provides an ex ante evaluation of the potential impact of GM cot- ton adoption in Uganda. A survey was used to calculate partial budgets for representative growers and compare partial budgets for various real and simu- lated scenarios. The partial budget of a low-input cotton producer was com- pared with that of a high-input producer. Similarly, we compared the partial budget of a conventional cotton producer with that of an organic producer. The latter two cases were used to develop the simulated scenarios of conven- tional cotton producers using GM seed (both Bt and HT cotton) and organic producers using Bt cotton.
The primary data for this analysis comes from two main cotton- producing districts in Uganda: Kasese and Lira. Partial budgets are used to evaluate the profitability of cotton production and to compare conventional and organic cotton production with hypothetical GM scenarios. We added stochastic simulations to the partial budgets to account for the effects of risk

    and uncertainty related to cotton production and profitability. The sampling framework for the collection of the primary information does not permit the extension of findings to the country level. However, this exercise does provide an initial assessment of the potential impact of GM cotton adoption on farm- ers in the most important cotton districts in Uganda.
Our findings suggest that GM cotton has the potential to contribute to improving the productivity of cotton. However, this technology would proba- bly make only a minor contribution to the performance of cotton in Uganda if the access to high-quality inputs was not properly addressed. Overall, the sim- ulations show that conventional production using Bt and HT cotton varieties

could yield higher returns than either the conventional or the organic system, but the profitability of the crop will not increase dramatically. Our results also show that the largest benefits could be reached in the unlikely case that GM seed (Bt cotton) could be used in organic production. We have mentioned sev- eral times that access to high-quality inputs is critical to improve cotton per- formance in Uganda. From the perspective of a conventional production, this alternative deserves consideration. On the one hand, the current conventional cotton production uses minimal amounts of inputs and approximates the organic system. On the other hand, the investment and institutional changes needed to reach this goal are probably not feasible in the short run. Although our sample size, especially the number of observations for organic producers, does not allow us to make extensive conclusions, this is an area that needs fur- ther exploration.
The vertical integration of the chain could facilitate the dissemination of GM technology, but the availability of seed and inputs of good quality and appropriate extension support have to be guaranteed. Some problems exist with respect to seed quality, and it is not clear how the introduction of GM seed could solve these problems. For instance, it is necessary to improve the ginning quality in the country. Regardless of the type of seed or farming sys- tem used, investment in fertilizers, high-quality seed, and other agronomic and management practices are crucial to improve the profitability of cotton in Uganda.
In the case of Bt and HT cotton, farmers are not using significant levels of pesticides and herbicides, and therefore the expected reduction of both chemi- cals would be small. If yield losses due to bollworms are lower than reported
by farmers (as in a low-incidence year), then the profitability of this tech- nology will dramatically decrease. In this regard, it does make sense to frame the introduction of the GM cotton technology as an insurance protecting Ugandan farmers from catastrophic or severe losses stemming from target pests and weeds.
The assessment of other sectors of the economy, national industry, trading status, and the institutional environment also need to be addressed to get a full picture of the potential impact of GM cotton in Uganda. For instance, at the national level, the technology fee charged by the innovator largely affects the benefits generated by the adoption of GM cotton. Because cotton seed is cur- rently distributed free of charge, it is clear that, before releasing the technol- ogy, Uganda needs to develop a strategy to negotiate with the developer of the technology the fee that will be charged to farmers. Similarly, the coexistence of organic and conventional cotton production using GM seed could be possible

if institutional arrangements are implemented beforehand to avoid contamina- tion and damaging organic exports.
A critical point in the case of the HT cotton scenario is farmers’ abilities to apply the herbicide glyphosate. Very few farmers in the survey reported herbi- cide use, much less glyphosate, either because of the high costs of this input or its unavailability. If farmers cannot access glyphosate, then they will probably revert to manual weeding, with a direct impact on yield and expected bene- fits. There is also the issue of training in the use of herbicides and understand- ing the concept of herbicide tolerance and its implications for herbicide use. This raises a policy question that developers and policymakers in Uganda must address to ensure capturing the potential benefits of the technology. It would be worthwhile to explore in more detail whether a program to improve train- ing and access to herbicides is warranted.
A question partially addressed by this study is whether reducing down- side risk to cotton farmers in Uganda by reducing insect and weed damage compensates for the cost and effort in introducing a complex technology. It is important to take into account the additional inputs needed to enable dam- age control (such as the herbicide glyphosate), and changes in management practices (such as the need for scouting to ensure that insect pressures do not overwhelm Bt protection level) will determine how transferable the GM tech- nology is and how easily it can be adopted by Ugandan farmers.
Although it is possible to compare the profitability of a given year of organic cotton production with conventional cotton production using
GM seed, this gives only a small part of the picture. Because we are inter- ested in contributing to poverty alleviation, it is much more significant— but at the same time challenging—to evaluate the long-term contribution of either system to the farmers’ welfare. This is a research topic that needs fur- ther attention.

Chapter 4
Benefits, Costs, and Consumer Perceptions of the Potential Introduction of a Fungus-Resistant Banana in Uganda and Policy Implications
Enoch M. Kikulwe, Ekin Birol, Justus Wesseler, and José Falck-Zepeda
Banana is a staple crop in Uganda. Ugandans have the highest per capita consumption of cooking bananas in the world (Clarke 2003). However, banana production in Uganda is limited by several productivity con-
straints, such as insects, diseases, soil depletion, and poor agronomic practices. To address these constraints, the country has invested significant resources in research and development (R&amp;D) and other publicly funded programs, pur- suing approaches over both the short and long term. Uganda formally initi- ated its short-term approach in the early 1990s; it involves the collection of both local and foreign germplasms for the evaluation and selection of cultivars tolerant to the productivity constraints. The long-term approach, launched
in 1995, includes breeding for resistance to the productivity constraints using conventional breeding methods and genetic engineering. Genetic engineer- ing projects in Uganda target the most popular and infertile cultivars that can- not be improved through conventional (cross) breeding. The main objective of genetic engineering in Uganda is to develop genetically modified (GM) cul- tivars that are resistant to local pests and diseases, have improved agronomic attributes, and are acceptable to consumers (Kikulwe et al. 2007).
The introduction of a GM banana in Uganda is not without contro- versy. In Uganda, where the technology of genetic engineering is still in its infancy, it is likely to generate a wide portfolio of concerns, as it has in other African countries. According to the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST) (2006), the main public concern is the safety of the technology for the environment and human health.
Several countries have designed and implemented policies to address
the safety concerns of consumers and producers (Beckmann, Soregaroli,
and Wesseler 2006a,b). Such policies include assessment, management, and communication of the biosafety profiles of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) (Falck-Zepeda 2006). As a consequence of its international obliga- tions and the need to guarantee a socially accepted level of safety to its citizens,

100 CHAPTER 4
Uganda has taken significant steps to ensure the safety of GM biotechnol- ogy applications. GM banana varieties will need to undergo biosafety assess- ments1 and receive the regulatory approval of the country’s National Biosafety Committee before being approved for research, confined field trials, and release into the environment for commercialization.2
However, the biosafety regulatory process has several economic conse- quences, as biosafety regulations are not costless endeavors. Kalaitzandonakes, Alston, and Bradford (2007) calculate the compliance costs for regulatory approval of herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant (Bt) maize to be on the order of about 7–50 million US dollars (US$). They note that the approval costs for similar types of GM crops will be alike. In addition, biosafety- testing requirements can consume significant amounts of time—from a few months to several years. A delay in the approval of a new variety forestalls access to the potential benefits generated by farmer adoption of the technol- ogy, and one can expect such costs to be substantially higher than the regula- tory compliance costs (Wesseler, Scatasta, and Nillesen 2007).
Jaffe (2006) has noted that existing drafts of Uganda’s biotechnology and biosafety policy stress the importance of the socioeconomic implications of the technology for biosafety regulation, but that author also observes a lack
of precision in identifying the socioeconomic aspects and how they should be considered. In fact, Article 26.1 of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity gives countries the choice of whether to include socioeconomic considerations in the biosafety assessment process con- sistent with other international treaties, although limited to the context of bio- diversity ( Jaffe 2006). Article 26.1’s “may take into account” clause has been applied strictly in some countries, such as India, where the socioeconomic con- sideration is mandatory for biosafety applications.
Many countries, including Uganda, have not determined whether and how to include socioeconomic considerations, at what stage of the regulatory pro- cess to include them, and what the scope and decisionmaking process within biosafety regulations should be. In fact, some biosafety experts (and some countries) have resisted including a socioeconomic assessment as a mandatory part in the biosafety decisionmaking process, as in their view, such issues may
1 The original scope of biosafety as described in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety was environ- mental safety. However, over time the original scope has been expanded to include food and feed safety in terms of toxicity or allergenicity. In this chapter, it is therefore understood that the label biosafety includes both environmental and food/feed safety.
2 Five technologies have been approved for confined field trial testing in Uganda: a virus-
resistant cassava, a weevil-resistant sweet potato, an insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant cotton, a fungus-resistant banana, a bacteria-resistant banana, and a nutrition-enhanced banana.

cloud that process and distract regulators from the scientific/technical issues related directly to biosafety. It is worthwhile to note that inclusion of socio- economic considerations for biosafety regulatory approval at the laboratory/ greenhouse or confined field trial stages contributes very little to the decision- making process, as the material will not enter the food chain and thus will not be commercialized until it is given regulatory approval further along in the process. Therefore, a major objective of this chapter is to illustrate the rele- vance of socioeconomic analyses for supporting biotechnology decisionmak- ing (and in particular, the importance of consumer perceptions) but also for contributing to the development and implementation of biosafety regulations. We present a general approach using the GM banana as an example, assuming the GM banana has passed standard food safety and biosafety assessments and thus can be considered to be safe.
The GM banana is the pioneer staple foodcrop in Uganda developed through modern biotechnology. Though different transgenic traits are being developed (see Shotkoski et al. 2010), in this chapter our focus is on a fungus- resistant GM banana with a trait resistant to the airborne fungal leaf-spot dis- ease known as black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis), which can reduce yields by 30–50 percent. The development of an agronomic trait possessing this fungal disease resistance is important, as the new banana can substan- tially increase yields, which would directly improve the livelihoods of farmers (Kikulwe, Wesseler, and Falck-Zepeda 2008; Kikulwe 2010). The bananas tar- geted for modification are the East African endemic cultivars, including cook- ing bananas that are mostly grown and highly preferred by consumers.
Given the importance of the crop, a better understanding of the socio- economic effects of introducing a GM banana is desirable to build public con- fidence in the technology and its implications for food security. In addition, assessing the potential benefits as well as the economic welfare will shed light on the question of under which conditions will Uganda in particular, and African countries in general, gain from GM crops without making a particular population segment worse off. Specifically, five sets of research questions are addressed in this study:
1. What are the expected social incremental benefits and costs under the con- ditions of irreversibility, flexibility, and uncertainty of introducing GM bananas in Uganda?
2. What are consumers’ knowledge about and attitudes and perceptions toward introducing GM bananas in Uganda? How do they differ between rural and urban households? Do consumers know, and have trust in, the

102 CHAPTER 4
institutions responsible for regulating, releasing, and selling GM crops in Uganda?
3. How does preference heterogeneity influence choice of banana bunch attributes across individual households? What are the differences between consumer preferences in urban and rural households for banana bunch attributes?
4. How much are consumers willing to pay for the values accruing from GM bananas given a social benefit? How does this willingness compare across different segments of consumers?
5. What are the impacts of introducing GM bananas on food security in Uganda? What implications does introduction have for biosafety regula- tions in general?
In the following sections, we discuss the benefits that a GM banana could
provide to producers and consumers in Uganda and the role of biosafety reg- ulations in governing the introduction of a GM banana. The results of a real option model are presented that show how concerns about environmental risks can be considered in a cost-benefit analysis as a first step toward a socio- economic assessment of introducing a GM banana in Uganda.
In addition, we show how the results of the economic analysis can be combined with the consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a GM banana using a choice experiment model. We explicitly demonstrate how one can
use both random-parameter logit and latent-segment models to capture and account for heterogeneity among consumer preferences given a tangible eco- nomic benefit of the GM banana.3 The study complements and extends the dimensions of previous research (Li et al. 2003; Loureiro and Bugbee 2005; Knight et al. 2007) on consumers’ WTP for GM food by, first, incorporating the forgone economic benefits of a delay in release and, second, incorporating producers as consumers in the sample. The approach is unique in its applica- tion to banana varieties in a developing-country context.
Before presenting the results of the WTP analysis, results of consumer knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP) toward the GM banana and its regulation are introduced. The consumer perceptions presented in this chap- ter hold numerous implications for scientists, policymakers (regulators), the public, and other stakeholders.
3 A tangible economic benefit refers to a benefit forgone if the GM banana is not introduced immediately.
 
BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 103
The aim of this chapter is to mention and discuss a range of these implica- tions. The contribution is structured as follows. The next section discusses in more detail the relevance of a GM banana for Uganda. The following section introduces an overview of biosafety regulations in Uganda. The subsequent section presents the overall approach and explains its application. The main results are then reported, followed by a section on the policy implications of the empirical findings for decisionmaking on biotechnology and biosafety reg- ulations in Uganda for the GM banana in particular, and other GM crops in general. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed in the final section.
Relevance of a GM Banana for Uganda
Banana is one of the most important crops in Uganda, with approximately
7 million people, or 26 percent of the population, depending on the plant as a source of food and income. Bananas are estimated to occupy 1.5 million hect- ares of the total arable land, or 38 percent of the cultivated land, in the country (Rubaihayo 1991; Rubaihayo and Gold 1993). The plant is grown primarily as a subsistence crop in rural areas, although consumption is not limited to rural areas, as approximately 65 percent of urban consumers in Uganda have a meal of the cooking variety of banana at least once a day. Ugandans have the highest per capita consumption of cooking bananas in the world (Clarke 2003).
Most banana varieties grown in Uganda are endemic to the East African highlands—a region recognized as a secondary center of banana diver-
sity (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Swennen and Vuylsteke 1991; Smale and Tushemereirwe 2007). The endemic banana varieties (AAA–EA genomic group) consist of two use-determined types: cooking bananas (matooke)
and beer bananas (mbidde). Karamura (1998) recognized 238 names of East African highland banana varieties in Uganda, with 84 clones grouped into five clone sets. The nonendemic clones include dessert bananas (varieties that are consumed raw), some beer bananas (varieties suitable for beer and juice mak- ing), and roasting bananas (or plantains).
Banana yields in Uganda are severely reduced by several pests and dis- eases. Among the pests that cause the most yield damage are weevils (Cosmopolites sordidus) and nematodes (Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus goodeyi, and Helicotylenchus multicinctus). The diseases that contribute
to the worst yield losses in Uganda are the soilborne fungal Panama dis- ease, or Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum); bacterial wilts, including the banana Xanthomonas wilt (Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum); and

104 CHAPTER 4
the airborne fungal leaf-spot disease black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijien- sis Morelet) (Gold 1998, 2000; Gold et al. 1998; Gold, Pena, and Karamura 2001; Tushemereirwe et al. 2003b).
Consequently, the National Banana Research Program of the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) in Uganda has developed a breeding program that employs a range of traditional crop-breeding meth-
ods and a portfolio of biotechnologies to address the crop’s most debilitating problems caused by pests and diseases (Kikulwe et al. 2007). The short-
term breeding strategy includes the assembly of local and foreign germplasms for evaluation and selection of varieties resistant or tolerant to existing produc- tivity constraints. Resistance to a limited set of pests and diseases (for example, black Sigatoka) was identified in hybrid banana varieties. Though character- ized by bigger bunches, the hybrid varieties are not widely grown in Uganda (Nowakunda 2001; Smale and Tushemereirwe 2007). Producers and consum- ers prefer the East African highland cooking bananas, but these are also highly susceptible to black Sigatoka (Nowakunda et al. 2000; Nowakunda 2001)
and bacterial wilts (Tushemereirwe et al. 2003a). Susceptibility to diseases prompted the national researchers to adopt a long-term breeding strategy that includes the generation of new genotypes and other new approaches to intro- duce resistance.
The highest yielding highland cooking bananas proved to be sterile, which slows down their improvement through conventional breeding (Ssebuliba 2001; Ssebuliba et al. 2006). With major biotic constraints not easily addressed through conventional breeding and management practices, recent efforts have been made to employ genetic engineering for the insertion of resis- tance traits into selected banana background planting material. Unlike cross- breeding, genetic engineering allows for improving the agronomic traits (for example, disease and pest resistance), as genes are inserted into potential host varieties (cultivars) while not changing other production and product attri- butes (for example, cooking quality). The genetic modification approach has shown potential for the improvement of the crop (Tripathi 2003).
Edmeades and Smale (2006) argue that the choice of a host variety for a genetic transformation largely determines its acceptability by producers and consumers. In those regions strongly affected by biotic constraints, it is likely that GM banana cultivars will be more beneficial to poorer and subsistence- oriented farmers. In addition, the insertion of multiple traits into East African highland bananas, although associated with additional R&amp;D costs (for exam- ple, transformation and regulatory costs), could further increase the benefits generated by the adoption of the technology in Uganda. Multiple traits may

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 105
also increase adoption rates, as farmers may not immediately notice the benefi- cial effect of a single trait.
Although GM bananas look promising for large-scale (mass clonal) multiplication and dissemination, empirical evidence of the success of such organisms is still limited. Long-term multiplication of micropropagated (tissue-cultured) plants, for example, may lead to epigenetic4 (somaclonal) variations. Additionally, genetic uniformity in a trait intensifies the probabil- ity of mutations in the targeted pest or disease that overcome resistance and increase epidemic vulnerability. These two aspects raise questions about the clonal fidelity of offspring plants and their genetic stability, both affecting eco- nomic benefits of GM banana varieties. In this context biosafety measures to monitor, evaluate, and mitigate effects of such occurrences become critical for the appropriate deployment of the technology in Uganda.
Despite these possible effects on the persistence of economic benefits of a GM banana, it is important to note that throughout the chapter we assume the GM banana has been proven safe for human health and the environment according to standard safety assessments.
Biosafety Regulations in Uganda
Uganda is among the few African countries that have invested in agricultural GM crop R&amp;D and have initiated procedures for confined field trials to evalu- ate GM technologies (Atanassov et al. 2004).5 The country has taken signifi- cant steps to ensure safety in biotechnology application (Nampala, Mugoya, and Ssengooba 2005). Biosafety regulations and, to a degree, biotechnol-
ogy developments in Uganda are governed in the context of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (GOU 2002b, 2004). Uganda signed the protocol in May 2000 and ratified it in November 2001 (GOU 2004; Wafula and Clark 2005). UNCST is the institution responsible for implementation of the bio- safety protocol and is the protocol’s designated competent authority. UNCST
4 Epigenetic changes are changes that do not affect the DNA sequence of genes but change the gene in other ways. These changes may be induced spontaneously in response to environmental factors or to the presence of a particular allele, even if it is absent from subsequent generations. Modgil et al. (2005) note that the in vitro process, length of in vitro culture, and in vitro stress stemming from unnatural and nutritional conditions are some of the factors believed to induce epigenetic changes.
5 The GM banana field trials were approved by the National Biosafety Committee and have been established at Kawanda by NARO. Note that Uganda now joins the other five African coun-
tries that have conducted confined field trials of GM crops: Burkina Faso, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Of those, only Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa have approved crops for commercialization.
 
106 CHAPTER 4
established the National Biosafety Committee (NBC), a technical evaluation arm, in 1996. NBC is responsible for reviewing applications and implement- ing general biosafety guidelines and regulations (GOU 2004; Wafula and Clark 2005).
Currently, the basis for the development and application of biotechnol- ogy is the National Science and Technology Policy of 2001 (GOU 2004). The National Science and Technology Policy provides general reference to biotechnology within the broader context of the role of science and technol- ogy in national development. The responsibilities of the various institutions and agencies involved in the approval process for biotechnology products have been outlined in the Biosafety Framework of 2000. The National Biosafety Framework, which was developed by UNCST, is based on the United Nations Environment Programme’s International Technical Guidelines on Safety in Biotechnology (enacted in 2001). Those guidelines provide terms of reference for NBC and the institutional biosafety committees—detailed information on risk assessment and management procedures for microbes, inspection, and approval (Traynor 2003).
Under the National Biosafety Framework, UNCST has the mandate of approving GMOs for research purposes, confined release into the environ- ment, and commercial planting in Uganda. UNCST receives all applications for research on or the deliberate introduction of GMOs, conducts a screening for completeness, and enters the applications into the national public records as submitted, before forwarding them to NBC for review and risk assessment evaluation. The complete risk assessment is done by the applicant. The NBC is obliged to review the risk assessment dossiers submitted by the applicant after the application has been assessed by the institutional biosafety commit- tees and finally advises UNCST.
The members of NBC are stakeholders, such as representatives from reg- ulatory agencies, the scientific community, universities, the private sector,
and civil society (Nampala, Mugoya, and Ssengooba 2005). The NBC is also responsible for writing the draft National Biotechnology and Biosafety Policy, the draft National Biosafety Regulations (GOU 2004), and the Guidelines on Biosafety in Biotechnology for Uganda (GOU 2002a), and for develop- ing draft manuals addressing specific issues surrounding biosafety regulations, such as confidential business information. These documents make up the bio- safety regulatory framework for Uganda. At this time, the documents still need to be approved by the government ( Jaffe 2006). The implementation
of the finally agreed-upon biosafety regulations for a specific GM crop will be managed by UNCST. UNCST is advised by the National Biotechnology

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 107
Advisory Committee, which is an interministerial committee including rep- resentatives from key institutions in biotechnology development and NBC (GOU 2004).
Applications for the import and export of GMOs are also approved by NBC. The government of Uganda (GOU 2005, 6) stipulates that “any per- son, prior to intentionally introducing a GMO shall apply to the Competent Authority for authorization. In case of imports, the exporter or the Competent Authority in the country of export may submit an application on behalf of an applicant, and may designate in the application with whom the Competent Authority shall communicate regarding the application.” In the case of field testing, the government of Uganda (GOU 2005, 7) continues to specify that “the applicant shall document to the Competent Authority that participating personnel will have appropriate training [and] that the field test will be over- seen by an individual possessing appropriate technical expertise.” The com- petent authority has to reply within 90 days. Within a period of not more than 270 days after the scientific risk assessment, the competent authority will make a final decision on whether to approve or deny the applicant the author- ity to introduce the GMO. Thus, if all the required documents are submit-
ted and complete, the approval will take about one year. In the case of a denial of a request, the applicant is given 30 days to appeal with genuine reasons or additional relevant information, and the competent authority has 30 days to render a final decision. The competent authority will finally make public any proposal about the intentional introduction of GMOs. The public is given not more than 60 days to submit comments, which the competent authority will take into consideration before the final decision is made.
According to Wafula and Clark (2005), NARO submitted applications
to UNCST in 2000 to introduce Bt cotton and Bt maize, but they were not approved for confined field trials. One of the reasons UNCST gave was that Uganda was unprepared to handle GM crops, because it lacked a national bio- technology and biosafety policy. In addition, Uganda lacked confinement and containment facilities for GMO field trials. Recently, the government selected biotechnology as one of the priority areas in its plan for the modernization of agriculture (OPM 2005). Consequently, substantial investments have been made in institutional development and capacity building for agricultural bio- technology and biosafety.
Jaffe (2006) analyzed and compared biosafety regulatory systems in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania using the African Model Law, which is one of the documents given consideration throughout Africa when a country begins drafting laws and regulations to address biosafety. Jaffe’s assessment considered

108 CHAPTER 4
key issues, such as comprehensiveness, transparency, participation, and effi- ciency of the regulatory systems. In the context of Uganda’s existing biosafety regulatory framework, despite all the efforts that have been made, the author notes some shortcomings, particularly in the areas of transparency and clar-
ity regarding the process to be followed, so that all interested stakeholders are able to understand and meet the requirements of the regulatory process. Those shortcomings include, first, no clear indications of how the assessment of the potential food-safety risks that might arise from the GMOs will be handled. Second, even though UNCST is involved in the formulation of the biosafety regulation policy, the statute authorizing its creation does not provide legal authority to regulate GMOs. Neither the biosafety policy nor the government regulations establish a clear safety standard for approving a GMO. Third, the documents contain no elaborations on how and what socioeconomic consid- erations will be considered, how they will be analyzed, by whom, and how they will be considered in the decisionmaking process.
This chapter seeks to address the third shortcoming by providing informa- tion that, indeed, socioeconomic issues of introducing GMOs in Uganda are relevant. It also presents methods to identify socioeconomic issues and pro- vides suggestions for addressing them.
Approach and Implementation
The framework of the research comprises two approaches: real options and a choice experiment. The latter relates the economic benefits to potential con- sumer concerns. Primary and secondary data sources were used for this study. Primary data were generated from a survey conducted in three administra-
tive regions, Eastern, Central, and Southwestern Uganda, comprising three distinct agroecological zones where cooking bananas (green bananas) are produced and consumed. The study was implemented in July and August 2007 with face-to-face interviews. Six enumerators were hired and trained specifically for this study. In implementing the survey, enumerators briefly described the context of the study and informed the respondents that there were no wrong or right answers but their opinions were of interest. A total of 421 households, drawn with a random sample stratified into rural and urban households using the then-current community listings of 21 randomly selected communities, allowed us to draw general conclusions (Figure 4.1).
The survey questionnaire was designed to collect information on the respondents’ observed characteristics. First, each respondent was asked ques- tions about his/her KAP regarding GM crops and food. In part two, social,

 demographic, and economic information on the households was collected, including the characteristics of the banana purchase, decisionmaker(s), and other members of the household. The final part consisted of the choice experi- ment. The detailed description of the study area, the questionnaire, and the information provided to the respondents is reported in Kikulwe (2010). Secondary data are taken from the database of a NARO/International Food Policy Research Institute project conducted between 2003 and 2004 in Uganda. The dataset is complemented by data for banana production for 1980 through 2004 obtained from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS 2006) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2006).
Different econometric models were applied to the datasets to test hypoth- eses related to the five research questions. A real option model was used to esti- mate the maximum incremental socially tolerable irreversible costs (MISTICs) for GM bananas, providing a maximum threshold value for consumer

110 CHAPTER 4
perceived irreversible costs of introducing GM bananas, as explained in more detail in Kikulwe (2010) and Kikulwe, Wesseler, and Falck-Zepeda (2008).
An explanatory factor analysis was applied to investigate the underly- ing latent structure of the KAP data. Random-parameter logit models and latent class models were then applied to investigate consumers’ preference heterogeneity for banana attributes in the choice data. Finally, we compared the MISTICs with the willingness to pay for GM bananas to derive pol-
icy implications.
Overview of Findings
To achieve the overall aim of this study, five research questions were addressed. This section presents the highlights for each research question.
1. What are the expected social incremental benefits and costs under the con- ditions of irreversibility, flexibility, and uncertainty of introducing GM bananas in Uganda?
A real option approach6 (see Appendix 4A) was followed to analyze the
social incremental benefits and costs (that is, the MISTICs) and social incre- mental reversible benefits (SIRBs). Irreversibilities and uncertainties have been considered in the literature on introducing GM crops (for example, Wesseler, Scatasta, and Nillesen 2007). Scatasta, Wesseler, and Demont (2006) introduced the term MISTICs to identify the threshold value for consum-
ers’ WTP for not having a GM crop introduced. The MISTICs associated with the adoption of a GM banana in Uganda were calculated using equa- tion 4A.1 in Appendix 4A and presented for different risk-free and risk- adjusted rates of return, as shown in Table 4.1. The results showed the MISTICs to be between approximately US$176 million and US$359 mil- lion per year, or between US$282 and US$451 per hectare per year. In the sce- nario with a risk-adjusted rate of return of 12 percent and a risk-free rate of interest of 4 percent—which we considered to be a reasonable scenario based on the results of Mitthöfer (2005)—the annual MISTICs per household are about US$38. This result can be interpreted as follows: the immediate release of the GM banana should be postponed or abandoned only if the average

household is willing to give up more than US$38 per year for not having such a banana introduced.
In the case where approval of the GM banana is delayed due to missing regulatory procedures and protocols, Uganda will forgo potential benefits (SIRBs) in the approximate range of US$179 million to US$365 million per year. This forgone benefit can be an indicator of how much Uganda can pay to compensate for potential damages. Additionally, the SIRBs provide a clue about the maximum costs farmers would endure to comply with biosafety of about US$303 per hectare. Adopters of the GM banana would not be will- ing to pay more than US$200 per hectare per year in transaction costs—that is, costs to comply with biosafety regulations, R&amp;D costs, and technology transfer costs. If the average WTP per hectare of a banana-growing household is below the MISTICs, but biosafety regulators are inclined to implement

112 CHAPTER 4
biosafety regulations to address concerns of consumers with a high WTP for not having the GM banana, those additional costs should not exceed US$200 on average per year per hectare planted to GM bananas. Assuming a maximum of 541,530 hectares that may be planted with GM bananas in Uganda, this implies that the maximum total costs to bring the GM banana to Ugandan producers cannot exceed US$108 million. Otherwise, the GM banana is not a viable alternative.
Based on the MISTICs results, it is evident that Uganda loses from not introducing a fungus-resistant GM banana. But only if the average household is willing to give up more than US$38 annually for not having GM bananas introduced should an immediate release be postponed. This analysis demon- strates a relationship between agricultural policy, R&amp;D, technology delivery, and impact, which shows an inverse relationship between stringency (pre- cautionary approaches) and technology delivery. That is, the more stringent the approval process is, the greater will be the potential benefits that are for- gone annually, which negatively affects both the scientists and the technology end users.
2. What are the consumers’ knowledge about and attitudes and perceptions toward introducing GM bananas in Uganda? How do they differ between rural and urban households? Do consumers know, and have trust in, the institutions responsible for regulating, releasing, and selling GM crops
in Uganda?
As little is known about consumer KAP toward the GM banana in Uganda, an explanatory factor analysis was applied to investigate the underlying latent structure of the KAP data. The analysis of KAPs reveals the presence of three categories, including benefit, food-environment risk, and health risk KAPs. The KAP toward GM crops among rural and urban consumers varies, owing to a number of socioeconomic characteristics, suggesting a rural–urban bias. Given quality benefits, consumers are more willing to accept GM bananas, but at the same time they are concerned about the unknown negative effects of
the technology. Results show that rural consumers value the quality benefits, whereas urban consumers are more concerned about the safety of the technol- ogy (Table 4.2). Education and income have negative effects on GM banana acceptability. Results further indicate that there is a relatively high level of awareness and trust in local leaders and extension workers. Respondents were less aware of UNCST and the Consumer Education Trust, the two main agen- cies responsible for informing consumers about GM food.

114 CHAPTER 4
In conclusion, we argue that delaying the approval of a fungus-resistant GM banana in Uganda is more in line with the preferences of urban (in par- ticular, the better educated and wealthier) consumers than with rural ones. But how can the negative perceptions among the urban and wealthier ones become positive or neutral at best? There is a need to ensure transparency and par- ticipation but to strike a balance with the feasibility of a system. However, if the system is not participatory and does not respect dissenting opinions, then legitimacy is taken from it. If this is the case, then people tend not to respect the regulatory system. The main lesson is for NARO and the government of Uganda to develop in advance communication strategies to ensure proper dis- cussion and address potential concerns.
3. How does preference heterogeneity influence choice of banana bunch attributes across individual households? What are the differences between consumer preferences in urban and rural households for banana bunch attributes?
The heterogeneity in consumers’ preferences for different banana attributes in Uganda was investigated using choice experiment data. The analysis of the choice data took into consideration preference heterogeneity resulting from locational and household-level characteristics. This helped to test whether consumers in rural and urban locations value banana attributes differently.
A random-parameter logit model7 was applied to investigate the heterogene- ity preference for the banana bunch attributes. Interactions of respondent- specific household characteristics with choice-specific attributes in the utility function were included in the model to account for the source of unobserved heterogeneity. This provided insights about differences in consumer valua- tion of the GM technology in addition to explaining the aggregate economic value associated with such technology, similar to the policy-change effect as analyzed by Boxall and Adamowicz (2002). Recent applications of random- parameter logit models (for example, Breffle and Morey 2000; Carlsson, Frykblom, and Liljenstolpe 2003; Kontoleon 2003; Morey and Rossmann 2003) have revealed that this model is superior to the conditional logit
7 The random-parameter logit model estimates both the mean coefficient and standard devia- tion of the random parameters. It is imperative to note the following. First, if the standard devia- tion estimate is not significantly different from zero, then one can conclude that the preference parameter is constant across the population. Second, if the mean coefficient is zero (or signifi- cantly smaller than the standard deviation) with a significant estimated standard deviation,
then there is preference diversity (that is, both positive and negative). Third, if both the mean coefficient and estimated standard deviation are insignificant, then the attribute has no impact on choices.

model in terms of overall fit and welfare estimates. In this chapter, there-
fore, a random-parameter logit model was applied, as shown in Appendix 4B. This was followed by a random-parameter logit model including interactions of respondent-specific characteristics with banana bunch attributes to provide more information about the sources of variation in preferences across respon- dents (see equation 4B.3). The selected respondent-specific characteristics included (1) household size (HHSIZE); (2) whether or not the respondent had postsecondary education (EDUC); (3) log of household monthly income (INCOME); (4) age of the respondent (AGE); (5) whether or not the house- hold grows bananas (GROW); (6) whether or not the household was found in the Eastern region (EAST); and (7) whether or not the household was found in the Southwestern region (SWEST). Findings reveal that there is substantial conditional and unconditional heterogeneity, as accounted for by the random- parameter logit model with interactions, carried out for each location (urban and rural) separately (Table 4.3).
The impacts of social and economic characteristics of the consumers on their valuation of the banana bunch attributes were significant, indicating the importance of considering such characteristics in explaining the sources of conditional heterogeneity. Even though bunch size is valued highly by both rural and urban households, urban and rural preferences differ concerning the introduction of a GM banana. The low-income rural households with larger household sizes value the GM technology that generates benefits to produc- ers more highly than do the urban ones. Conversely, respondents with higher education were found to be more critical of the GM technology, which would negatively influence their willingness to accept the GM banana. Statistical tests confirm that there are significant differences in preferences for banana bunch attributes between urban and rural households in Uganda.
The application of the econometric models in this section supports two conclusions. First, a connection needs to be established between banana attri- butes and crop improvement efforts. In that sense, there is a need to link plant breeders, consumers, producers, and decisionmakers. For instance, it is evident in the findings that bunch size matters a lot for both rural and urban respon- dents. Therefore, breeding efforts should concentrate on improving bunch size but without forgetting other quality attributes. Second, increasing the partici- pation of consumers, producers, and producers who happen to be consumers in the decisionmaking process and in marketing chains can help reduce nega- tive perceptions. This is important, not only because of the benefits, but also because of negative responses (such as anti-GM banana campaigns) that failure to include these stakeholders may trigger.

4. How much are consumers willing to pay for the values accruing from GM bananas given a social benefit? How does this willingness compare across different segments of consumers?
Unlike the previous section, where models with interactions and split samples were used to explain heterogeneity of preferences at the individual level, to answer this question we employed a latent class model, which is a more recent model to investigate preference heterogeneity. The latent class model has suc- cessfully identified the sources of heterogeneity at the segment level, unlike the covariance heterogeneity models and random-parameter logit models, which capture heterogeneity at the individual level. Investigation of hetero- geneity at the segment level would be most policy relevant when assessing the welfare impact of the introduction of a technology, such as a GM food prod- uct, on different segments of the population (see, for example, Hu et al. 2004; Kontoleon and Yabe 2006; Birol, Villaba, and Smale 2009). This approach depicts a population as consisting of a finite and identifiable number of seg- ments, or groups of individuals. Preferences are relatively homogeneous within segments but differ substantially from one segment to another. The num-
ber of segments is determined endogenously by the data. The fitting of an individual into a specific segment is probabilistic and depends on the social, demographic, and economic characteristics of the respondents, as well as on their KAPs. Furthermore, respondent characteristics affect choices indirectly through their impact on segment membership.
An increasing number of studies have used this approach to estimate farm- ers’ and consumers’ preferences for various agricultural technologies and food items. For example, Scarpa et al. (2003); Ouma, Abdulai, and Drucker (2007); and Ruto, Garrod, and Scarpa (2008) employed this model for the valuation of livestock attributes. Hu et al. (2004); Owen, Louviere, and Clark (2005); and Kontoleon and Yabe (2006) used it to investigate consumer preferences for GM food. And Birol, Villaba, and Smale (2009) used it to examine farmer preferences for agrobiodiversity conservation and GM maize adoption.
This analysis involved, first, testing further whether preferences of urban households differ from those expressed by rural households. Second, this study included welfare benefits for producers as one of the attributes. Producer benefits often have not been considered in studies on consumer preferences regarding GM food, and we expect these to have a positive effect on consumers’ preferences, similar to the results reported by Loureiro and Bugbee (2005) and Gaskell et al. (2006). The theoretical approach for investigating preference heterogeneity using the latent class model is briefly

118 CHAPTER 4
summarized in Appendix 4C; a detailed explanation and empirical results are reported in Kikulwe et al. (2011).
The findings show that there is significant heterogeneity in consumer pref- erences in our sample. The analysis identified two distinct segments of banana consumers, the potential GM banana consumers (representing 58 percent of the sample and residing more often in rural areas), and the potential GM banana opponents (representing 42 percent of the sample, with the majority found in urban areas). GM bananas are valued the most by poorer households who are located in the rural areas of the Eastern region, where banana pests and dis- eases are prevalent. These consumers are also younger and have positive opin- ions regarding the benefits of GM food and crops. They have larger families and are less often employed off-farm, and they have relatively lower monthly incomes. They would be willing to pay larger premiums for GM bananas
and to ensure producers of bananas derive higher benefits (Table 4.4). The empirical findings support Edmeades and Smale (2006), who argue that cli- ents of GM banana-planting materials are likely to be the poorer, subsistence- oriented households in regions greatly affected by biotic pressures. These results are also consistent with results for the second and third research ques- tions. The utility of the potential GM banana opponents’ segment, mainly rep- resenting urban consumers, decreases with the introduction of a GM banana, which generates benefits to producers. These consumers would therefore be willing to accept a discount for both GM bananas and benefits to produc- ers. Most of these consumers are older and better off; they reside mainly in

urban areas of the Southwestern and Central regions, and mostly associate the GM banana with risks (that is, food, environmental, and health risks). The total WTP among those who gain (the potential GM banana consumers) from the introduction of the GM technology is greater than the total WTP among those who lose (the potential GM banana opponents) due to this tech- nology. The findings suggest that the gainers (the majority of whom are rural consumers) can potentially compensate the potential GM banana opponents (mostly urban consumers) if a GM banana is introduced in Uganda, which
is in accordance with the Hicksian compensation criterion ( Just, Hueth, and Schmitz 2004).
The latent class econometric analysis supports several conclusions related to the introduction of GM bananas in Uganda. First, findings confirm that GM bananas could be a potentially pro-poor biotechnology, and their intro- duction would mostly benefit rural households who grow and buy bananas. Second, we find support for Paarlberg’s (2008) argument that negative atti- tudes of urban elites in African countries can be explained by their views on GM food being closer to the European viewpoint versus that of the rural peo- ple in their own country. Our empirical findings suggest that better educated people are on average more strongly opposed to GM bananas, which holds not only in urban areas but also in rural ones. Third, rural consumers are willing to pay a higher premium for producer benefits compared to their urban counter- parts, suggesting a significant difference between urban and rural consumers’ preferences regarding producer benefits. But findings indicate that stressing the potential benefits the technology may provide to farmers is more likely to increase the opposition toward the GM banana among the urban consumers. Based on the preferences of the various groups of stakeholders, the introduc- tion of GM bananas would be desirable for Ugandan society as a whole, and would merit policy support, albeit with consideration of compensation mech- anisms aimed at smoothing the gains and losses of benefits. Finally, the main lesson learned is that if preference heterogeneity of consumers is not consid- ered, then the results are likely to be biased. Therefore, for studies that seek to explore consumer preferences, heterogeneity is the primary hypothesis. This has implications for study design, scope, and selection of best practices for evaluation purposes.
5. What are the impacts of introducing GM bananas on food security in Uganda? What implications does introduction have for biosafety regula- tions in general?

120 CHAPTER 4
The empirical findings estimated to answer questions 1, 2, and 4 are inte- grated in an economic welfare analysis to provide an overall assessment of the effects of introducing GM bananas on aggregate welfare. The MISTICs asso- ciated with the immediate introduction of a GM banana were compared with the estimated WTP values for the GM banana for different scenarios. We applied the concept of compensating surplus to consumers’ preferences for a GM banana, and conducted simulations based on different combinations of impacts associated with GM-banana-introduction strategies to estimate the consumers’ welfare measures, as presented in Appendix 4D (and explained
in detail in Kikulwe 2010). Welfare measures were estimated for the best-
fit latent class model (see question 4).
The findings showed that there are respondents who gain and those who lose from the introduction of a GM banana, which is consistent with results in the previous section. The total welfare for those who gain (potential GM banana consumers) is greater than the total welfare for those who lose (poten- tial GM banana opponents) (Table 4.5).
The potential GM banana consumers, who are mostly located in rural areas, acknowledged much higher willingness to pay for all the proposed GM banana

alternatives, particularly a GM banana which is characterized by large bunches and large benefits to producers. With this finding, it is evident that benefits to producers played a significant role in the valuation of the banana bunch attri- butes. These results imply that if a GM technology can improve crop produc- tivity (and hence increase incomes of the rural subsistence households), that technology would be easily accepted among the rural population segment. Nonetheless, when the potential GM banana opponents’ households are consid- ered further, their total WTP for the proposed banana improvement scenarios were greater than their estimated average MISTICs per bunch (see Figure 4.2). Based on this finding, we could argue that, on the one hand, the potential GM banana opponents are likely to pay more than the threshold value of not hav- ing a GM banana introduced in Uganda. On the other hand, the calculated

122 CHAPTER 4
MISTICs per bunch for the potential GM banana opponents’ households were generally low, ranging approximately between US$0.15 and US$0.36. Thus,
if the government is to address the concerns of the potential GM banana oppo- nents, it will not exceed the potential forgone benefits (US$200) estimated when addressing question 1. There will be still enough to compensate for the negative effects if a fungus-resistant GM banana is introduced. The aggre-
gate welfare showed improvement in welfare over status quo for all scenarios, which is highest when a GM banana with large bunches and medium benefits is proposed. Thus, if a fungus-resistant GM banana with such attributes is now introduced, its introduction may result in strong opposition from the poten- tial GM banana opponents’ segment of the population, which is composed of mainly urban consumers.
Based on the empirical findings discussed in this section, the follow-
ing conclusions can be derived. First, the GM banana technology is likely to improve overall welfare in Uganda, but we need to think carefully about those who may lose from the introduction of this technology. Thinking about this beforehand can reduce the loss. But the big question is how do we maximize the benefits and reduce cost and risk? Second, a comprehensive cost–benefit analysis, using different approaches, would be of great importance for assess- ing the potential benefits and costs of introducing new technologies—such as GM bananas. The net social costs or benefits of most GM crops are likely to be crop-specific, especially in terms of food and environmental safety issues. Introduction strategies would need to consider the distribution of potential costs, benefits, and risk for these new GM crops before a decision to introduce them is made.
Policy Implications
The findings in this chapter demonstrate several implications for different stakeholders in the banana industry in Uganda, and in Africa in general. First, the calculation of the MISTICs considers explicitly possible long-term effects of GM bananas. The results indicate that with each year of delay in the intro- duction of a GM banana, Uganda loses between about US$179 million and US$365 million. The MISTICs are about US$176 million or more. Only if the real average annual irreversible costs of planting a GM banana would be as high, or higher than, the irreversible benefits, should the release be delayed. We have found no evidence yet that this will be the case. Given the poten-
tial and significant economic benefits from the introduction of a GM banana,

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 123
one might conclude that NARO has to work harder to push the GM banana through the biosafety protocols as promptly and efficiently as possible.
Findings have revealed that government policies delaying the introduction of GM bananas are more in line with the views of wealthier and better edu- cated citizens, the elites, than with the views of the majority of the population. Although this is a disturbing observation—as mainly rural households eco- nomically gain from the introduction of a GM banana—a careful approach toward introducing a GM banana is needed to avoid strong urban consumer resistance. In that case, knowing who will be affected by the new innovations is fundamental in foretelling aggregate benefits.
The findings have further shown that the introduction of GM bananas could be beneficial for Ugandan society as a whole and would merit policy support, albeit with consideration of compensation mechanisms aimed at transferring some of the benefits from gainers to losers. Some methods of com- pensation might be providing more and reliable information about the safety of the technology, which could be channeled through (in addition to the cur- rent institutions) local authorities and extension workers. The findings show that there is a high level of awareness and trust in local leaders and extension workers and scant knowledge of UNCST and Consumer Education Trust, the two main agencies responsible for informing consumers about GM food. This finding suggests an opportunity for informing consumers about GM food through local leaders and extension workers. We would recommend instead
of UNCST and the Consumer Education Trust informing consumers directly that they use part of their resources for training local leaders and enlisting their help in spreading information. This strategy would help offset the negative KAP toward GM technology, especially among urban consumers.
The approach used here highlights how one can evaluate the socio- economic aspects of GM crops in general, linking both the consumers
and adopters of the technology. We have also indicated how one can con- sider long-term irreversible effects and assess consumer attitudes about GM crops. Empirical research along the lines of the methodology followed in this study can be adapted to new GM crops requiring biosafety assessments prior to commercialization. Such research can help overcome one of the problems of establishing a biosafety system in Uganda and in other developing coun- tries. In particular, NARO may institutionalize the approach suggested in this study and build a system that allows for conducting similar analyses of other GM crops—such as Bt cotton currently undergoing environmental and food safety assessments.

124 CHAPTER 4
Finally, there is a need to broaden the scope of biosafety processes (now pri- marily focused on risk) to include food security considerations and agricultural development. This calls for more funding for R&amp;D. Findings have revealed that if a technology has tangible benefits that could improve the incomes of subsistence farmers, that technology could find its way easily to the end users. However, the research agencies that can develop such technologies are finan- cially constrained. For instance, NARO, the main agricultural research agency, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the agricultural research bud- get in Uganda (ASTI 2002), has received less budget share for fiscal year (FY) 2011/12. That is, the budget for agricultural R&amp;D funded by the government of Uganda has decreased from 12.6 percent of the total agriculture budget in FY2008/2009 to 11.8 percent in FY2011/2012. Similarly, the donor funding for agricultural R&amp;D through NARO has also decreased from 30.0 percent of the total agriculture budget in FY2008/2009 to 17.3 percent in FY2011/12 (GOU 2009, 2012). Yet modern biotechnology was embraced as one of the priority areas targeted by the government to increase incomes and improve the quality of life of poor subsistence farmers through increased productivity and increased share of marketed production (OPM 2005). Our study shows addi- tional financial resources are needed for informing potential opponents about the benefits of the technology, as otherwise resources spent might be wasted.
Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research
The choice experiment approach used to collect data for the model simula- tions involved mainly the use of surveys of relevant decisionmakers. It involved collection of data from both producers as consumers (who are the likely poten- tial adopters) and those consumers of bananas who do not produce them. The choice modeling technique follows a Lancaster utility approach for analyzing relative importance of product attributes within a relevant product-choice set. However, stated preference approaches are subject to various criticisms. The most important limitation of the choice experiment noted by List and Gallet (2001), akin to other stated preference methods, is that little may be gener- ated from a hypothetical market about the real market behaviors as a result of disparities between hypothetical and actual statements. However, this issue has been addressed by numerous economists in the literature. For example, List, Sinha, and Taylor (2006) compared choice experiments with hypotheti- cal and real situations. In their experiment, the authors informed respondents about the hypothetical bias problem through “cheap talk” and reminded the respondents to take care when making their choices. The authors found no

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 125
statistically significant differences between hypothetical and real willingness to pay or when estimating the marginal values of attributes. As a result, in our study respondents were informed about the ongoing biotechnological inno- vations in Uganda using brochures prior to the interviews. They were also reminded that there were no right or wrong answers, and that they should consider their choices carefully. In addition, Lancaster (1966) recommended that to determine the product attribute, it is very important to contact the potential consumers directly. In our study informal interviews with consum- ers, such as focus group discussions, were used to develop and design the ques- tionnaire, which was later pretested on both rural and urban consumers prior to primary data collection. With a view to the caveats discussed, the findings support Edmeades and Smale (2006)—who used a revealed preference tech- nique to predict the demand of GM banana-planting materials. However, an empirical investigation comparing hypothetical and real market situations may be warranted.
In the empirical analysis of SIRBs, the data for nonprivate net benefits were not available in the public domain. Hence, the SIRBs were estimated based
on private net benefits. Furthermore, when estimating the MISTICs, we did not include the transaction costs that might be involved between the tech- nology developers and the end users, including R&amp;D costs, compliance with biosafety regulatory costs, and technology fees.8 Such costs can be substantial and are one of the major obstacles to technology dissemination in develop-
ing countries such as Uganda (Brenner 2004). The problem is not limited to GM technology but includes embodied technologies in general. Adding such costs will reduce the SIRBs. Again, they should on average not be more than the SIRBs per hectare, and should be even less if biosafety regulatory costs at the farm level are added. Another limitation of the study is that the MISTICs calculated were generally for Uganda as a country; however, they are likely to vary by region and even by cultivar. Edmeades (2003) notes the diversity of banana cultivars is high at the country, village, and household levels. On aver- age, 23 different banana cultivars are grown at the village level across Uganda, with approximately 5 different cultivars of cooking bananas grown per house- hold. Households located at high elevations, such as the Southwestern region, were found to grow more cultivars compared to those at low elevations (for example, the Central region and most parts of the Eastern region). Thus, MISTICs may be larger for regions (or households) where banana production
8 As technology fees charged by innovators are used to recover R&amp;D and biosafety costs, it is imperative to include such costs as net costs to society to avoid double-counting.
 
126 CHAPTER 4
is high compared to those with low banana production. These issues necessi- tate future empirical research.
Finally, the findings reported in this chapter have shed light on the differ- ences between the urban and rural consumers’ preferences regarding banana bunch attributes. However, future research is required to understand in more detail why urban consumers as well as rural and urban elites derive disutility from GM bananas and the associated benefits for producers. In addition, more empirical research is needed to find more mechanisms through which those who gain may compensate those who lose in case GM bananas are introduced.
APPENDIX 4A: MISTICs
We begin with the assumption that incremental reversible net benefits follow a continuous-time, continuous-state process with trend, where GM crops may be released at a point in time. In this approach, the social incremental revers- ible benefits W * (or SIRBs; the symbol * indicates optimal timing) need to be greater than the difference between the social incremental irreversible costs (I ) and the social incremental irreversible benefits (R), weighted by the size of the uncertainty and flexibility (or hurdle rate) associated with the introduction
of the new technology. The hurdle rate is commonly expressed in the form β/(β – 1), where β &gt; 1 captures the uncertainty and flexibility effect and is a result of identifying the profit-maximizing decision rule under irreversibility, uncertainty, and flexibility, if benefits do follow a geometric Brownian motion. The geometric Brownian motion is a Wiener process with a geometric trend, for which changes expressed as natural logarithms are normally distributed. The Wiener process is a continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic Markov process with three properties: (1) probability distributions of future values depend on the current value only, (2) the Wiener process grows at indepen- dent increments, and (3) changes are normally distributed. The assumption that the adoption of this technology follows a geometric Brownian motion accounts for the uncertainty of the technology (Cox and Miller 1965). The interpretation of the decision rule for the case of a GM banana is that, as long
as W – β (I – R) ≤ 0, Uganda should delay adoption of a GM banana until β– 1
more information about the new technology is available.
In the context of GM crops, where people are more concerned about
the not-so-well-known irreversible costs of the technology, it is feasible to estimate threshold values that indicate the maximum incremental social irre- versible costs that an individual or society in general is willing to tolerate
 
BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 127
as compensation for the benefits of the technology. Scatasta, Wesseler, and Demont (2006) have called this threshold value the MISTIC (I *). In the spe- cific case of Uganda, the estimated MISTICs can be interpreted as the maxi- mum willingness to pay (WTP) for not having the GM banana approved for planting in the country. Actual incremental irreversible social costs (I) are to be no greater than the sum of incremental irreversible social benefits and incre- mental reversible social net benefits for introducing a GM banana, such that
I &lt; I* = W + R. (4A.1) β/(β – 1)
The estimation of the MISTICs (I *) requires quantification of three factors: SIRBs from GM crops (W ); the social incremental irreversible benefits (R) rate; and the hurdle rate, β/(β − 1). All these factors can be estimated or cal- culated using econometric and mathematical modeling techniques following Demont, Wesseler, and Tollens (2004).
We computed the SIRBs at time t (SIRB(t)) as the SIRBs at com-
plete adoption multiplied by the adoption rate at time t ( ρ(t)) and multi- plied by the exponential factor of the expected growth (or drift) at rate α: SIRB(t) ∙ ρ(t) ∙ e α t. The discounted sum of SIRBs (SIRBPV) for Uganda over time is calculated as
SIRBPV = ∫∙ SIRB(t)e –(μ–α)tdt, (4A.2) 0
where μ is the risk-adjusted discount rate, and α is the drift rate of the geo- metric Brownian motion, explained in more detail in Kikulwe, Wesseler, and Falck-Zepeda (2008).
We also tried to identify the social incremental irreversible benefits on
a per hectare basis using information provided by Bagamba (2007). Most banana producers in Uganda do not use pesticides or fungicides to manage pests and diseases, as mentioned earlier. A small proportion (less than a quar- ter) of banana producers applies small amounts of pesticides.
The different hurdle rates, β/(β – 1), were calculated defining β as follows (see Dixit and Pindyck 1994, 147–152):
1 r – δ 3r – δ 142 2r
β = 2 − σ2 + ! σ2 − 2 + σ2 &gt; 1, (4A.3)
where r is the risk-free rate of return; δ is the convenience yield defined as the difference between the risk-adjusted discount rate μ and the drift rate α (that is, δ = μ – α &gt; 0, μ ≥ r); and α and σ2 (variance rate) as before. The maximum
       
128 CHAPTER 4
likelihood estimators for α and σ 2 were estimated following Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997).
In our analysis, we limit ourselves to the private incremental revers-
ible benefits at the farm level, assuming all the rents from the new technol- ogy are captured by farmers. In the longer run, the rents will be distributed among farmers, the agents in the banana supply chain, and banana consumers. Additional secondary benefits, such as improved food security and reduced vulnerability to external shocks, may be generated through higher farm income among banana growers. Assessing such benefits would require the use of a general equilibrium model for Uganda and are beyond the scope of this study. Thus, the computed SIRBs are equal to the private incremental revers- ible benefits.
APPENDIX 4B: The Random Parameter Model
An RPLM, or a mixed logit model, is a model that accounts for prefer-
ence heterogeneity by using a random parameter component to the vector of coefficients (βs). The RPLM does not require the independence-of- irrelevant-alternatives (IIA) assumption. It can also account for unobserved, unconditional heterogeneity in preferences across respondents, even when conditional heterogeneity has been considered, as well as correlation among choices arising from the repetition of choices by the same respondent (McFadden and Train 2000; Garrod, Scarpa, and Willis 2002). The random utility function in the RPLM is given by
Uij = V(Zj(β + ηi)) + e(Zj). (4B.1)
The utility is decomposed into a deterministic component V and an error com- ponent stochastic term e. Indirect utility is assumed to be a function of the choice attributes Zj, with the utility parameter vector β, which due to prefer- ence heterogeneity may vary across respondents by a random component ηi. By specifying the distribution of the error terms e and ηi, the probability of choos- ing j in each of the choice sets can be derived (Train 1998). By accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, the random parameter logit model takes the form
Pij = exp(V(Zj(β + ηi))) . (4B.2) Ch=1 exp(V(Zh(β = ηi)))
 
BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 129
Because this model is not restricted by the IIA assumption, the stochastic part of utility may be correlated among alternatives and across the sequence of choices using the common influence of ηi. Treating preference parameters as random variables requires estimation by simulated maximum likelihood. The maximum likelihood algorithm searches for a solution by simulating k draws from distributions with given means and standard deviations. Probabilities are calculated by integrating the joint simulated distribution.
Even though unobserved heterogeneity can be accounted for in the RPLM, this model fails to explain the sources of heterogeneity (Boxall
and Adamowicz 2002). One solution to detecting the sources of hetero- geneity while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity could be to include interactions of respondent-specific household characteristics with choice- specific attributes in the utility function. The RPLM with interactions can detect preference variation in terms of the unconditional heterogeneity of tastes (random heterogeneity) and individual characteristics (conditional heterogeneity), so improving the fit of the model (Revelt and Train 1998; Morey and Rossmann 2003).
When the interaction terms are included in the utility function, the indirect utility function that is estimated becomes (Rolfe, Bennett, and Louviere 2000)
Vij =β+β1Z1 +β2Z2 +...+βnZn +δ1(Z1S1)+δ2(Z2S2)+...+δl(ZnSm). (4B.3)
In this specification, m is the number of respondent-specific characteristics that explain the choice of a banana bunch, and δ1 to δ2 is the l-dimensional matrix of coefficients corresponding to the vector of interaction terms S that influence utility. Because respondent-specific characteristics are constant across choice occasions for any given respondent, respondent characteristics only enter as interaction terms with the banana bunch attributes.
Empirically, equation 4B.3 was then extended to include the 42 interac- tions between the six banana bunch attributes and the seven respondent- specific characteristics:
Vij = β + β1(ZBUNMED) + β2(ZBUNLAR) + β3(ZBENMED) + β4(ZBENLAR)
+ β5(ZGMTEC) + β6(ZPRICE) + δ1(ZBUNMED × SHHSIZE)
+ δ2(ZBUNLAR × SHHSIZE) + . . . + δ42(ZPRICE × SSWEST), (4B.3 ́)

130 CHAPTER 4
where β refers to the alternative specific constant (ASC), which was set equal to 1 if either option A or B was chosen and 0 if the respondent chooses the status quo (option C) (Louviere et al. 2000),9 ZBUNMED is the medium bunch size, ZBUNLAR the large bunch size, ZBENMED the medium benefit, ZBENLAR the large benefit, ZGMTEC GM biotechnology, and ZPRICE the percentage price change. Based on the correlation matrices and variance inflation factors (VIF)10 results, seven consumer characteristics were retained and interacted with the five banana attributes levels to investigate the possible sources of heterogeneity. The selected consumer characteristics included: (1) household size (HHSIZE); (2) whether or not the respondent had postsecondary edu- cation (EDUC); (3) log of household monthly income (INCOME); (4) age
of the respondent (AGE); (5) whether or not the household grows bananas (GROW); (6) whether or not the household was found in the Eastern region (EAST); and (7) whether or not the household was found in the Southwestern region (SWEST).
APPENDIX 4C: The Latent Class Model
The latent class model (LCM) casts heterogeneity as a discrete distribution by using a specification based on the concept of endogenous (or latent) pref- erence segmentation (Wedel and Kamakura 2000). The approach describes a population as consisting of a finite and identifiable number of groups of indi- viduals called segments. Preferences are relatively homogeneous within seg- ments but differ substantially across segments. The number of segments is determined endogenously by the data. The insertion of an individual into
a specific segment is probabilistic and depends on the characteristics of the respondents. In the model, respondent characteristics indirectly affect the choices through their impact on segment membership.
In the LCM used here (see Kikulwe et al. 2011), the utility that consumer i, who belongs to a particular segment s, derives from choosing banana bunch alternative j P C can be written as
Uij/s = βs Xij + εij/s , (4C.1)
9 A fairly more negative and significant ASC indicates a higher tendency of the respondent to
choose the status quo. 1 2 2
10 VIF for each regression is calculated as VIF = 1 – R2 , where R is the R of the artificial
regression with the ith independent variable as a “dependent” variable. Independent variables which exhibited VIF &gt; 5 are eliminated, indicating that they are affected by multicollinearity (Maddala 2001).
  
BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 131
where Xij is a vector of attributes associated with banana bunch alterna-
tive j of a choice set C and consumer i, and βs is a segment-specific vector of taste parameters. The differences in βs vectors enable this approach to cap- ture the heterogeneity in banana bunch attribute preferences across segments. Assuming that the error terms are identically and independently distributed (IID) and follow a Type I distribution, the probability Pij/s of alternative j being chosen by the ith individual in segment s is then given by
Pij/s = exp(βsXij) . (4C.2) C exp(βsXih)
h=1
A membership likelihood function M* is introduced to classify the con- sumer into one of the S finite number of latent segments with some probabil- ity, Pis. The membership likelihood function for consumer i and segment s is given by M*is = λsZi + ξis, where Z represents the observed characteristics of the household, λk(k = 1, 2, . . ., S) is the segment-specific parameters to be esti- mated, and ξis is the error term. Assuming that the error terms in the consumer membership likelihood function are IID across consumers and segments and follow a Type 1 distribution, the probability that consumer i belongs to seg- ment s can be expressed as
Pis = exp(λsXi) . (4C.3) S exp(λkXi)
k=1
The segment-specific parameters λk denote the contributions of the various consumer characteristics to the probability of segment membership, Pis. A pos- itive (negative) and significant λ implies that the associated consumer charac- teristic, Zi, increases (decreases) the probability that the consumer i belongs to segment s. Pis sums to one across the S latent segments, where 0 ≤ Pis ≤ 1.
By bringing equations 4C.2 and 4C.3 together, we can construct a mixed- logit model that simultaneously accounts for banana bunch choice and seg- ment membership. The joint unconditional probability of individual i belonging to segment s and choosing banana bunch alternative j can be given by
  Pijs = (Pij/s) × (Pis) = exp(βs Xij) exp(λs Xi) 4. (4C.4)
3C exp(βs Xih)43S exp(λk Xi) h=1 k=1
  
132 CHAPTER 4
The two models (appendixes 4B and 4C) used have advantages and dis- advantages. The RPLM and LCM, though they both focus on the deter- ministic component of utility, capture heterogeneity differently. The RPLM captures heterogeneity at the individual level, but it assumes the distribution of taste preferences across the population. The LCM is less flexible (that is, the attribute and variable parameters in each segment are fixed), but it allows explaining preference heterogeneity across segments of a given population. In our data set we used both approaches, but we later applied statistical meth- ods to choose which approach fits our data best (for model comparison, see Colombo, Hanlay, and Louviere 2009).
APPENDIX 4D: Compensating Surplus Welfare Analysis
The best-fit LCM,11 which is used to group the population into homogeneous segments, was employed to estimate the required parameters for welfare mea- sures. The LCM allows us to calculate WTP welfare measures for each respon- dent in a segment. Deriving welfare measures under the LCM is done in two steps. First, policy impacts at the segment level are identified by calculating WTP welfare measures for each segment. Second, the standard aggregate pro- cedure that assumes homogeneous preference is corrected for heterogeneity. That is done by computing the weighted sum of segment-specific welfare mea- sures. The weights are the estimated individual segment membership probabil- ities (Boxall and Adamowicz 2002). The individual segment WTP can finally be aggregated to calculate WTP welfare measures for the whole population.
The compensating surplus (CS) welfare measure for changes in the banana bunch attributes, conditional on the segment membership, can be derived from the estimated parameters by using the following equation (Bateman et al. 2003):
  11
C S n = Θ 1 3 l n  e V 1i – l n  e V 0i 4 , ( 4 D . 1 ) price iPC iPC
Following Colombo, Hanlay, and Louviere (2009), a comparison between RPLM with interac- tions (rural sample) and LCM results into a probability of P ≤ Φ(–37.20) ù 0 and that for RPLM with interactions (urban sample) and LCM gives P ≤ Φ(–26.55) ù 0. That is, for RPLM with interactions for urban (K2 = 16) and LCM (K1 = 19), ρ2 – ρ12 = 0.198, while for RPLM with inter- actions for rural (K2 = 18) and LCM, ρ2 – ρ12 = 0.207. This indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected; hence the LCM is preferred. These results show that the preference heterogeneity in our data is better accounted for at the segment level rather than at the individual level.

BENEFITS, COSTS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF A FUNGUS-RESISTANT BANANA 133
where the compensating surplus CSn is the amount of money that one would have to give the individual n after the change has occurred for that person to remain as well off as before (that is, after choosing alternative i in the choice set C ); Θprice is the marginal utility of money and is the coefficient of the banana bunch price attribute; V 0i represents the individual’s utility at the initial level (that is, the current state: banana bunches bred through traditional biotech- nology); and V 1i is the utility of the alternative level (that is, after change state: bunches bred by GM biotechnology) following changes in attributes.
The final marginal WTP welfare measure can be derived by first integrat- ing the welfare effects across the different segments,
C S n | s = Θ 1 3 l n  e V 1i – l n  e V 0i 4 , ( 4 D . 2 ) prices iPC iPC
where s = 1, 2 is the number of segments, and Θprice is the coefficient on the banana bunch price attribute for each segment providing each segment’s mar- ginal utility of income; and then by calculating the weighted sum of the seg- ment membership:
2 H13 1 04J
C S nt | s =  W n s Θ l n  e V i – l n  e V i , ( 4 D . 3 )
iPC prices iPC iPC
where Wns is the probability of an individual n being in segment s.
To estimate the consumers’ compensating surplus (CS), conditional
on being in segment 1 or 2, for introduction of a GM banana over the sta-
tus quo, four possible options were created. The creation of the four policy- relevant scenarios was based on the banana bunch profiles. The attribute levels that characterize a number of alternative banana bunch improvements scenar- ios are listed below, along with the base case:
• Base case (small bunches with no benefits)—status quo: this is the baseline situation where banana bunches consumed are mostly of small bunch sizes, produced through traditional biotechnology. The price for the base case is at UGX 3000 for a 10-kilogram bunch.
• Scenario 1 (all medium improvement): medium banana bunch size pro- duced by GM biotechnology that generates medium benefits (in the form of increased yields) for producers.
• Scenario 2 (all large improvement): large banana bunch size produced by GM biotechnology that generates large benefits for producers.

CHAPTER 4
• •
Scenario 3 (large bunch with medium benefits): large banana bunch size produced by GM biotechnology that generates medium benefits for producers.
Scenario 4 (medium bunch with large benefits): medium banana bunch size produced by GM biotechnology that generates large benefits for producers.
To find the CS associated with each of the above scenarios, the difference between the welfare measures under status quo and the four banana bunch options was calculated.
For the consumer segment that was found to have negative WTP (the potential GM banana opponents), the next step was to find out whether their negative WTP was below or above the MISTICs. We compared the MISTICs per bunch with the estimated total WTP per bunch. To calculate the MISTICs per bunch, we divided the annual MISTICs per household by the average number of bunches consumed per household. Using a per capita con- sumption of cooking bananas in Uganda of 250 kg per year (NARO 2001),
an average bunch size of 10 kilograms (baseline), and an average household size of the potential GM banana opponents of 5.67 members per household (estimated under research question 4; see Kikulwe et al. 2011), and dividing the annual consumption with the average bunch size resulted in an average
per capita consumption of 25 bunches per year. The product of the per cap- ita bunches consumed and household size yielded an average of approximately 142 bunches consumed per household per year. Dividing the MISTICs per household by the number of bunches consumed per household and year after deducting the planting costs provided the MISTICs per bunch.

Chapter 5
Genetically Modified Organisms, Exports, and Regional Integration in Africa
David Wafula and Guillaume Gruère
As noted in the introduction to this volume, genetically modified (GM) crops have been characterized by high adoption rates and a steady increase in global market value. However, their rapid diffusion has triggered a diversity of concerns, including issues related to the safety of the technology to human health and the environment, socioeconomic consid- erations, and issues of ownership and control. Trade-related impacts and access to export markets are increasingly emerging as another major concern. Destinations such as the European Union (EU), where the level of caution and consumer scepticism is relatively high, have attracted a lot of attention (see, for example, Gruère 2006; Paarlberg 2009).
More specifically, several African countries have been preoccupied with the notion that adoption of GM crops would attract a blanket rejection of agri- cultural exports by importing countries in the Western world, especially by European countries (see, for example, Gruère and Sengupta 2009; Paarlberg 2009). The dilemma in policymaking circles has been how to harness the potential benefits of GM crops while preserving trade interests and niche markets (Anderson and Jackson 2005). Although some countries have taken precautionary stances, others have decided to take a “wait and see” stance (Gruère 2006). The potential economic risk for these countries of taking con- servative GM-free policy positions is that they may deny farmers the oppor- tunity to harness and maximize the potential benefits of the technology. By focusing on avoiding any potential future export risks with Europe or other developed nations, these countries may have filtered out nonrisky but benefi- cial technology.
At the same time, little attention has been accorded to the intraregional trade dimension, which is increasingly becoming fundamental (Diao et al. 2005). Intraregional trade in future commercialized products is going to be an issue that may affect trade and the entire regional integration efforts unless biosafety regulatory mechanisms are put in place to address them.

144 CHAPTER 5
This chapter reviews results from the literature to discuss issues of GM product use, export risk management, and regional integration in Africa. The next section focuses on possible export risks associated with the use of GM crops outside of the region, and the subsequent section discusses the increas- ing role of regional harmonization schemes. The chapter concludes with some policy lessons.
Implications for Exports of Commercializing GM Crops
Agriculture is the economic pillar of most African countries south of the Sahara. About 70 percent of the population in most African countries is rurally based and depends on agriculture as a source of income and livelihood. In this regard, efforts related to the promotion of agricultural productivity have been placed at the top of Africa’s integration priorities and processes. The agricultural sector in the region is facing many challenges, including produc- tion constraints at the farm level. In exploring a range of technological options that can supplement conventional tools, the potential of agricultural biotech- nology has been recognized, even though reservations and resistance from some quarters still prevail ( Juma and Serageldin 2007). The issue of possi-
ble market-access barriers in key export destinations has been an issue of para- mount concern. However, the magnitude of the anticipated or perceived risks remains to be analyzed and understood in concrete terms.
Three types of approaches have been used in the literature, all directly or indirectly assessing export risks with the adoption of GM crops in specific countries or regions of Africa: qualitative case study analysis linking actors along the commodity chain, bilateral trade data analysis to assess the possi-
ble commercial risk, and quantitative economic simulations with trade mod- els under specific scenarios. We review the main results of these three types of studies in the following sections. At the same time, we also discuss the key lim- itations of each of these approaches.
Case Study Approach
Although several publications discuss the influence of exports on African decisions (for example, Paarlberg 2009; Gruère and Takeshima 2012), to our knowledge, only one paper uses a case study approach to systematically analyze their nature and implications. Gruère and Sengupta (2009) provide a review of international cases where GM-free private standards set up by supermarkets or other buyers in developed countries have affected biosafety decisions, includ- ing commercialization in developing countries.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 145
Because their analysis is qualitative and partially relies on secondary data from news clips and media reports that are not always accurate, the evidence may not be fully substantiated. Furthermore, even when based on primary data, the data do not allow measuring the scope or significance of the issues and their precise roles in influencing decisionmaking. The analysis simply points toward reports of influential links between trading actors and decision- makers in the area of biosafety.
Gruère and Sengupta (2009) find 29 cases in which export concerns influ- enced biosafety decisionmaking in 21 countries. They then classify these cases into three categories: cases where the alleged export risks associated with a spe- cific decision on GM crops are largely unfounded or irrational, cases where the export risks and policy decisions are debatable, and cases where decisions are supported by real commercial risks.
Interestingly, Gruère and Sengupta (2009) note that Africa south of
the Sahara is the region where the most cases with irrational risks are being reported. Although 11 of the 29 cases are in the first category, 7 of those were reported from Africa. Of the 13 cases related to Africa, 10 are in the first or second categories.
Several cases relate to cash crops. It is traditionally known that African countries have been leading exporters of cash crop commodities, including tea, coffee, cocoa, pyrethrum, sugar, tobacco, bananas, and a wide range of horti- cultural products to various destinations around the world. GM varieties for these traditional exports have yet to be developed, and the situation in Africa is unlikely to drive any commercial interest in releasing GM varieties of these crops. This being the case, there are unrealistic and unjustified requirements from some of the export destinations.
For instance, Gruère and Sengupta (2009) report that GM-free certifica- tion is required for exports of tea from Kenya to the United Kingdom, even though it is widely known that GM tea has not been developed or commer- cialized anywhere in the world. The product development pathway for genet- ically modified organisms (GMOs) shows that it takes about 10 years for a product to pass through the various regulatory steps before it is placed on the market. Development of GMOs also requires a massive capital and research- intensive investment (Sinai 2001).
They also find reports of organic producer groups in Kenya believing that producing GM field crops would jeopardize their exports of horticul- tural products. The Kenya Organic Association Network fears that intro- duction of GM varieties of maize or cotton would affect market access for horticultural products that are organically produced. Yet the possibilities

146 CHAPTER 5
of gene-flow contamination from maize or cotton to horticultural products cannot occur, because the products are not biologically compatible (Gruère and Sengupta 2009).
These and other cases provide qualitative evidence of possible irratio-
nal decisions in the presence of possible but unproven export risks in African countries. Gruère and Sengupta (2009) attribute this phenomenon to four factors: insufficient knowledge and information on the part of decisionmakers compared to influential agents, risk aversion, and misleading presumptions
on the existence of GM open markets and the possibility of segregating non- GM exports. Regardless of the specific reasons, their findings do shine a light on the strict precautionary behavior of African decisionmakers on biosafety and testing or use of GM crops.
Trade Data Analysis
Going one step beyond case studies, simple bilateral trade data analyses have been used to assess the likelihood of immediate export risk with the intro- duction of a GM crop in a particular country. The principle underlying such studies is that the examination of the composition, destination, and monetary value of commodities exported in past years can help assess the possible short- term trade-related ramifications and market-access barriers that may result from the introduction and commercialization of GM crops in particular coun- tries in Africa.
It should be noted that this approach has a number of critical limitations and does not provide sufficient information to dispel any potential trade risks. Most importantly, it is based on the assumption that past trade data provide
a valid representation of future trade relationships; that is, export destina- tions, trade volume, and value are assumed to remain similar for the period
of study and for the near future. Naturally, this is not an innocuous assump- tion, especially in the case of African countries south of the Sahara, which face a number of productivity and market constraints that may be overcome in the years to come.1 In particular, if a GM crop was able to increase productivity,
it might result in a net marketable surplus that would face export constraints. Furthermore, the assumption disregards the possibility of new trade flows from countries that do not export any potentially GM commodity to Europe and other GM-regulating countries (zero trade). Clearly, the lack of trade today does not mean there is no risk to trade in the future.
1 For instance, Juma (2010) argues that Africa has the means to become self-sufficient and even be able to export commodities in the near future.
 
GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 147
Still, even accounting for uncertainties, analyzing recent trade data can help discriminate cases that represent immediate or short-run export risks from others based on discourse rather than data. As noted in the previous section, some reported cases have linked seemingly irrational commercial risks to reg- ulatory decisions. Finding that a country has a large trade relationship with
a GM-regulating country is useful for managing risks and avoiding immediate export losses. For instance, Thailand and Vietnam, aware of the importance of non-GM rice preferences of major importers, decided to ban any experi- ment on GM rice to avoid any possible export loss (Gruère and Sengupta 2009). The presence of past trade with large importing countries that regulate or avoid GM food, although not necessarily predicting the future, provides useful information for decisionmakers.2
With these caveats in mind, an influential economic analysis was con- ducted on the trade implications of GMOs in Africa under the aegis of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) (Paarlberg et al. 2006). The Regional Approach to Biotechnology and Biosafety Policy in Eastern and Southern Africa project was initiated to address concerns that transboundary movement of GMOs in the COMESA region might impact trade among member states unless a regional policy mechanism was put in place to mitigate such eventualities. The project covered six case study coun- tries: Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.
The study analyzed the short-run trade ramifications of introducing and commercializing GMOs that are available globally under recent trade flows to current markets. The magnitude of potential immediate trade losses, based on 2003 bilateral trade data, was illustrated by examining the total value of agricultural commodity exports and the proportion of this export value that risks being rejected in market destinations that treat GM com- modities with sensitivity (either due to regulations or buyers’ preferences). That GMOs can affect trade cannot be disputed. Consignments of agricul- tural exports originating from a country that has commercialized GMOs are treated with suspicion and are generally expected to contain GMOs, even in cases where such consignments contain only GM-free products. The Regional Approach to Biotechnology and Biosafety Policy in Eastern and Southern Africa study computed the potential value of conventional agri- cultural food and feed products exported to various destinations from the six case study countries in 2003. The proportion that is likely to be rejected
2 Moreover, given the political realities, short-run considerations are much more powerful in the eyes of decisionmakers than long-term potential issues.
 
148 CHAPTER 5
because of GM sensitivity was ascertained and expressed as a percentage of the total agricultural food and feeds exported.
The share of the past exports that are GM-sensitive commodities con- sists of agricultural commodities whose GM counterparts have been approved globally for commercial planting. They include soybeans, maize, cotton, canola, squash, rice, papaya, tomatoes, and Irish potatoes.
The worst-case scenario of the analysis assumed that if the six targeted COMESA countries commercialized the aforementioned products, all exports of food and feed products associated with the crops in question (second col- umn of Table 5.1) would be rejected by all importing destinations world- wide. Naturally, this assumption is exaggerated, given that many countries
do not regulate imports of GM products and even those that do—including European countries—import large volumes of approved GM products. The findings revealed that the proportion of exports immediately at risk would be 8.5 percent for Egypt, 2.2 percent for Ethiopia, 1.1 percent for Kenya, 6.2 per- cent for Tanzania, 6.5 percent for Uganda, and 6.3 percent for Zambia.
Assuming that only the EU would reject the exports, the level of immediate risk for Egypt would be about 4 percent and the rest of the countries 1 percent or less, as shown in Table 5.2 (Paarlberg et al. 2006).
This low level of immediate trading risk exposure stems from the fact that most of the potential GM commodities go to other African countries. Thus, continental and regional demand largely exceeds external demand for the selected products. Although this result does not preclude the possibility that

Trade Simulations
Several research publications have focused on modeling the economic effects of GM crop adoption in the presence of trade restrictions in developed coun- tries (see Smale et al. 2009). Most of these papers studied the effects of adop- tion at the global or regional level, and only a few focused on the effects in Africa. Almost all of these papers used a computable general equilibrium model to simulate the effect of adoption or nonadoption of GM crops in spe- cific regions or throughout Africa south of the Sahara.
Although these simulations provide an improved, more detailed, and more structured representation of trade and economic effects, they also face a num- ber of limitations, notably because of their structure and the database they
are based on. In particular, they are based on several key assumptions, includ- ing the use of known and stable productivity shock and adoption rates in each country of production, masking the variability among producers, production practices (input use), regions, and years; a perfectly competitive world market; and a specific reference year. Their value is to provide some insight into the potential economywide effects of the use of GM crops in the region, based on specified assumptions.
In this category, several studies focused on the effects of adopting GM cot- ton (for example, Elbehri and MacDonald 2004; Anderson and Valenzuela 2007), a commodity that does not face any trade regulation (ICAC 2010),

150 CHAPTER 5
but whose adoption is found to be necessary in a globally competitive market. Assuming it is productivity enhancing, and knowing that all major countries have adopted GM cotton, there is a significant opportunity cost of nonadop- tion of GM cotton for countries in the region (Bouët and Gruère 2011).
In the case of GM food and feed crops, Anderson and Jackson (2005) use
a global general equilibrium model to simulate scenarios of adoption with a focus on Africa south of the Sahara. Their results show that GM crops gener- ate positive welfare gains to African countries south of the Sahara. The study also shows that welfare gains associated with adoption of GM crops outweigh the gains tied to greater market access in restrictive export destinations, such as the EU. The estimated gains would be slightly lower if the EU’s policies con- tinue to effectively restrict imports of affected crop products from countries that decide to adopt GMOs in Africa (Anderson and Jackson 2005).
These results are generally consistent with one of the other papers in the literature, and they do not seem to depend too much on the crop studied or the adoption level. Because of the low trade flows and the fact that the gains of GM crops are mostly captured domestically, African countries are found to gain regardless of regulatory barriers.
Yet at the same time, a few of these papers focus on potential trade impli- cations within Africa. Anderson and Jackson (2005) is the exception. It shows that a GM ban in countries of the Southern African Development Community to save rents from exports to Europe results in lower gains than would be obtained by GM crop adoption.3 Still, regional restrictions can matter, as shown by recent developments in South Africa. Some countries in southern Africa have adopted (transitional or seemingly established) strict import policies on GM food. This did not prevent South Africa from success- fully adopting and marketing GM maize in the past (Gruère and Sengupta 2010), but the situation changed in 2010 with an unexpectedly large harvest, leading to excessive marketable surplus. The combination of high GM maize adoption and the continued presence of GM import barriers in the region resulted in large domestic stocks that traders have had trouble selling, despite a significant maize shortage in parts of East Africa. As a result, the South African maize price dropped, while Kenya and other countries had to pur- chase high premium non-GM maize for imports.
This contrasting example underlines the role of regional integration, which is the subject of the following section.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 151
The Case for Regional Integration
The Biotechnology Revolution and Regional Integration
Regional integration is a process in which states enter into a regional agree- ment to enhance cooperation through regional institutions and rules. Its objectives can range from economic to political, although it has become a political economy initiative where commercial purposes are the means to achieve broader sociopolitical and security objectives. Efforts at regional inte- gration have often focused on removing barriers to free trade in the region, increasing the free movement of people, labor, goods, and capital across national borders. This works as a spur to greater efficiency, productivity gain, and competitiveness, not just by lowering border barriers, but also by reducing other costs and risks of trade and investment.
In numerous forums, African leaders have underscored the importance of greater coordination and harmonization among the continent’s many regional economic communities. For instance, the most important of these efforts are the Abuja Treaty establishing the African Economic Community and the more recent Constitutive Act of the African Union. Article 3 of the Act of the African Union underscores the need to “coordinate and harmonize the poli- cies between the existing and future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment of the objectives of the Union” (AUC 2011). The New Partnership for Africa’s Development, which is one of the core programs of the African Union, assigns a significant role to the regional economic communi- ties, emphasizes regional and subregional approaches, and encourages African countries to pool resources to enhance growth prospects and to build and maintain international competitiveness (UNECA 2006).
According to the COMESA secretariat, creation of a Customs Union has increased trade from US$9 billion in 2007 to US$15.2 billion in 2008. To sus- tain the positive trend, regulating trade in products that contain or may con- tain GMOs and transboundary movements of GMOs across porous borders
is going to be a fundamental element. It is on these grounds that African lead- ers have demonstrated political will and commitment to cooperate and take a common approach to biotechnology and biosafety issues at the regional level.
High-level meetings have been held to discuss matters touching on harmo- nization of biosafety standards. Deliberations at the Extraordinary Conference of the African Ministers Council on Science and Technology, held in Cairo in November 2006, focused on the African Strategy on Biosafety. The Strategy targets the national and subregional levels for planned interventions to be

152 CHAPTER 5
undertaken by the African Union and its member states to ensure harmony in policies concerning modern biotechnology and biosafety. The Strategy rec- ognizes efforts that the Regional Economic Communities have exerted in
the area of biosafety or interlinking trade and biosafety. These initiatives will be used to complement the efforts of the Union. The Conference of African Union Ministers of Agriculture, held in Libreville, Gabon, from November 27 to December 1, 2006, deliberated on An African Position on GMOs in Agriculture (AU 2006). The ministers recommended that the African Union set up mechanisms to identify commonalities among the Regional Economic Communities to be used to harmonize and coordinate policies on biosafety and biotechnology. Developments in regional harmonization are now con- spicuous in the COMESA region, the Economic Community of West African States, and the Southern African Development Community.
Implications of Commercializing GMOs for Intraregional Trade in Africa
Currently, three African countries have granted approvals for commercial release of GMOs. South Africa has been growing insect-resistant (Bt) cotton, Bt maize, and GM soya for more than a decade. Burkina Faso and Egypt com- mercialized Bt cotton and Bt maize, respectively, in 2008.
The importance of such commodities as cotton and maize has been rec- ognized in the region by such bodies as COMESA and the East African Community (EAC). Maize is a principal food-security commodity that dom- inates both formal and informal trade, especially in eastern and southern Africa. In 2007, the size of the regional maize market (EAC and COMESA) was estimated to be slightly more than US$1 billion. The total maize con- sumption in the region is about 16 million metric tons per year (Njukia 2006). The EAC development strategy for 2001–05 advocated liberaliza- tion of maize trade. COMESA, in collaboration with EAC and the Regional Agricultural Trade Expansion Support, has been exploring options for foster- ing regional maize trade. One of the strategies embraced is a “maize without borders” concept involving harmonized policies and regulatory frameworks to facilitate increased movement of maize across borders (COMESA 2003).
Efforts to promote trade in cotton in the COMESA and EAC regions have also been noted. In 2005, the first Regional Cotton and Textile Executive Summit was held in Nairobi, Kenya. The meeting resulted in the formation of the Africa Cotton &amp; Textile Industries Federation (ACTIF) in the same year. It is a regional body composed of the cotton, textile, and apparel sectors from across Africa south of the Sahara aimed at creating a unified and recognized

GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 153
voice in both regional and global trade affairs. ACTIF was officially launched on March 28, 2010.4
As evidenced by profiles of various commodities in the recent past (ICTSD and ATPS 2007), exports of crops for which biotech varieties could potentially be introduced and commercialized in Africa are largely destined
to other African countries. This is a strong indication that African countries should be more concerned about possible commercial export risks associated with intraregional trade. For instance, less than 5 percent of maize produced in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda is exported outside Africa. The share of maize traded intraregionally (that is, within Africa) is 98 percent for Kenya, 96 per- cent for Tanzania, and 99 percent for Uganda (ICTSD and ATPS 2007).
As borders are porous and effective mechanisms and infrastructure for monitoring transboundary movement of GMOs are often absent, Bt maize and Bt cotton can easily be shipped from one country to another either for- mally or informally. If Kenya commercialized Bt maize and Bt cotton ahead of Tanzania and Uganda, for instance, the chances of trade disputes erupting are high unless biosafety regulatory instruments are put in place to address trans- boundary movement of such commodities.
As mentioned earlier, Regional Economic Communities in Africa are push- ing for increased regional integration and free-trade areas. However, with some countries moving ahead with the commercialization of GMOs and others considering adoption of a GM-free stance, the unrestricted and rapid move- ment of such commodities as maize may not be realized. At the national level, several countries have provisions for handling imports, exports, or GMOs
in transit in their policies, laws, or regulations. However, it is important that such biosafety considerations are adequately incorporated into instruments of regional economic integration to safeguard disruption of intraregional trade. In the absence of mutually acceptable regional policies and guidelines, some countries may decide to go for stringent identification, testing, and labeling procedures. This would drastically slow down smooth cross-border flow of essential commodities. The costs of biosafety regulation could also increase the price of food in the importing countries.
Conclusions
In this chapter we discussed export risks associated with the use of GM crops in African countries. Several African countries have adopted a precautionary

154 CHAPTER 5
posture, to the point of imposing bans on adoption of GM crops, in an attempt to maintain access to target export markets (particularly countries in Europe) that prefer non-GM products. Yet our review of case studies, trade data, and simulation analyses suggests that most of the alleged risks are lim- ited, especially when compared to the potential benefit of adopting GM crop technology.
Although each of these study approaches has clear limitations, their results indicate that the presence of an immediate risk of export loss has been exag- gerated. In particular, an analysis of commodities produced and exported
from African countries indicates that the magnitude of short-run commercial export risk in destinations outside Africa would be relatively small in monetary terms, because current GM crops (like maize) are largely traded intraregion- ally. Agricultural exports to the EU, Asia, and the Middle East are tradition- ally of cash crops or horticultural products, such as tea, coffee, vegetables,
and flowers.
Still, because the results of these analyses are based on existing patterns of
trade, and trade patterns may change (or have the potential to change with cer- tain policies and investments), the consideration of the export consequences of allowing and expanding GM crops may differ across countries and would need to be assessed specifically for each country, depending on its circumstances and agricultural potential.
The example of South Africa is particularly telling; it was considered a suc- cessful importer and exporter of GM and non-GM maize in the past (Gruère and Sengupta 2010). But after an unexpectedly high GM maize harvest in 2010, it faced the problem of oversupply with insufficient foreign demand, driving domestic prices down, notably because of the import bans on GM products in the region.5
Thus, countries should carefully weigh the potential risks of losing export earnings on a case-by-case basis. Reluctance to approve beneficial GM crops, especially those that could deliver large welfare gains, is likely to deny farmers in the region the opportunity to harness the diverse benefits of GM crops and products. But rapid approval of highly traded GM commodities in the pres- ence of foreign regulations and low excess demand may also prove detrimental, leading to price depression.
5 After government efforts to find external buyers, in 2011/12, South Africa faced the reverse prob- lem of excessive external demand, forcing South African animal feed manufacturers to purchase maize from other countries at a higher price than the domestic price.
 
GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, EXPORTS, AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION 155
The importance of current intraregional trade in GM-sensitive commodi- ties implies that trade disputes could also erupt—especially if some countries reject imports of agricultural commodities on the grounds that they could be contaminated with GM products. This would impact negatively on current efforts to facilitate unrestricted movement of commodities, such as the “maize without borders” concept and customs union arrangements that have been concluded or are being negotiated.
Thus, regional cooperation in matters related to the transboundary move- ment of GMOs is bound to be of great importance. Bilateral and multilateral mechanisms to manage intraregional trade in products that may contain GMOs is required to ensure that the goals of regional integration are not jeopardized. Biosafety considerations should be adequately incorporated in regional integration instruments.

Chapter 6
Estimates and Implications of the Costs of Compliance with Biosafety Regulations for African Agriculture
José Falck-Zepeda and Patricia Zambrano
As noted in the introduction to this volume, the area planted to geneti- cally engineered (GE) crops has increased in developed and develop- ing countries since their commercial approval in 1996 ( James 2011). In Africa three countries, Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa, have approved the commercial cultivation of GE crops. Regulatory systems in other African countries have approved the deployment of laboratory/greenhouse experi- ments and confined field trials for the development of more technologies.
In addition, several developed and developing countries have made research and development (R&amp;D) investments in crops and traits of local interest
as a reaction to the observed benefits realized from GE crop cultivation in other countries (Atanassov et al. 2004). Yet public-sector research in develop- ing countries, including in Africa, has released very few products to farmers, even though no damage to human health or the environment has been docu- mented for any of the GE crops that have been approved and commercialized to date. This significant record is endorsed by science academies in Europe and the United States, international agencies, and national and regional regulatory agencies.
Two of the most pressing questions for Africa’s national R&amp;D systems and the International Agricultural Research Centers working in Africa are why
so few GM products have made it to farmers and why there is such a limited number of crops, trait choices, and geographical locations for the release of potentially valuable technologies.
One answer may be that compliance with national biosafety regulations has increased the cost, time, and effort required for the approval of these technolo- gies in African as well as in other countries. Increased costs may be negatively affecting research efforts to develop suitable and locally adapted technolo-
gies for developing countries (Kent 2004; Wright and Pardey 2006). Costs can be seriously increased when regulators are pressured to take into account concerns not necessarily related to the safety release of a product. For specific
 159

environments, valid safety questions might be raised regarding the effect of certain crops and traits. A solid regulatory system should be able to sort these valid concerns from those that are not needed to demonstrate safety.
As with any other innovation, conducting R&amp;D to develop GE crops and releasing them to farmers is a long and costly investment project. Compared to conventional technologies, GE crops can carry higher R&amp;D and technology transfer costs, but their stream of benefits over time can substantially offset these initial costs. Having a regulatory system that can operate in a timely and efficient way will guarantee that these benefits are not affected by unnecessary time delays, which is the single most important factor affecting benefit.
We structure this chapter as follows: first, we examine background bio- safety issues related to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; second, we dis- cuss the estimation of the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations; third, we present estimates for the cost of compliance in selected countries, including those developed for the African context; fourth, we discuss the implications for national research systems in Africa and elsewhere; and finally, we provide some concluding comments.
Background on Biosafety Issues
The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety does not explicitly define the term bio- safety.1 This situation is not unusual in international agreements, as there may not be sufficient consensus for an explicit definition in a multilateral con- text. The lack of definition leaves space for parties to the Protocol to define biosafety in their own legislation. Here we propose a functional definition of biosafety that considers the processes implemented within the scope of a regu- latory system that enables a robust risk analysis of modern biotechnologies to ensure their safe use. Box 6.1 contains other biosafety definitions. Biosafety in this sense is a principle that evaluates the adoption of a new technology with careful consideration of its potential effects on the environment and human/ animal health. This definition is very broad and acknowledges the lack of
a unique “best” approach to biosafety analysis (McLean et al. 2002). Each country bases its biosafety system on its own national, environmental, politi- cal, financial, and scientific capacities. The latter magnifies the importance
1 The Protocol does specify the scope in Article 4: “This Protocol shall apply to the transbound- ary movement, transit, handling and use of all living modified organisms that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health” (SCBD 2000, 5).

Convention on Biological Diversity—Biosafety Unit
Biosafety is a term used to describe efforts to reduce and eliminate the potential risks resulting from biotechnology and its products. For the pur- poses of the Biosafety Protocol, this is based on the precautionary approach, whereby the lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as an excuse to postpone action when there is a threat of serious or irreversible damage (see “What is the precautionary approach?”). While developed countries that are
at the center of the global biotechnology industry have established domestic biosafety regimes, many developing countries are only now starting to estab- lish their own national systems. [www.cbd.int/biosafety/faq/]
Ecolomics International
The concept of biosafety as it is used under the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety specifies those legal actions that an importing country is enti-
tled to take under international environmental law with the aim of protect- ing the biological diversity of its conventional plants and animals against the risk of contamination through imported varieties or species consisting of so- called Living Modified Organisms. These actions consist primarily of preven- tive or precautionary trade measures. Such restrictions or bans include the elaboration, negotiation and implementation of pertinent standards, and the institutionalization and international harmonization of the related regulatory framework and procedures. They also take into consideration the legally less clearly circumscribed concerns over related public health issues and socio- economic considerations. All these provisions aim at a non-hierarchical and mutually supportive relationship with other international agreements, espe- cially with WTO [World Trade Organization] law, with the Codex Alimentarius, and with the International Plant Protection Convention. [www.ecolomics- international.org/headg_biosafety.htm]
of framing biosafety within each country’s context as well as that of defining global principles of risk analysis and regulatory experiences.
In most countries with a biosafety system in place, regulators and policy- makers base their current biosafety assessments on past experience with risk analysis. These procedures provide a systematic and ideally science-based foun- dation that society can expand to address multiple consumer and other stake- holders’ concerns and conflicting issues deemed important by society. Several countries, particularly those which signed and ratified the Cartagena Protocol, enacted regulations for assessing, managing, and communicating the risk

assessment and subsequent decisionmaking for genetically modified crops (Mendoza 2005). A functional biosafety regulation system may have signifi- cant benefits for society and should ensure that the “right” technologies make it to market, while discarding those technologies that do not work or do not meet society’s safety standard.
Most biosafety regulatory processes consist of a sequence of steps that require advance review and regulatory approvals by some combination of insti- tutional, regional, or national biosafety committees. In Figure 6.1 we present an example of the typical steps taken for a biosafety assessment as part of a GE product development process. A typical sequence of steps may include labora- tory trials, glasshouse/greenhouse (contained) trials, confined field trials, step- up (extended) field trials, and commercialization, although many variations of the sequence presented in Figure 6.1 exist.
The linear sequence of events in Figure 6.1 considers the possibility that each step builds on the accumulated knowledge in previous regulatory steps or on the generation of additional knowledge submitted to regulatory authorities. Biosafety regulators examine application dossiers submitted by the proponent considering the parent crop, the transformation method, the gene construct, and the GM crop for health and environmental impact. All activities conducted dur- ing the regulatory approval phase incur a cost. Therefore, proponents need to include biosafety regulatory costs in total development costs.
Risk and cost considerations bound biosafety assessments and biotechnol- ogy decisionmaking processes (Viscusi, Vernon, and Harrington 2000). The tensions among safety, technology use, and cost translate to trade-offs among

ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 163
these competing issues. In terms of risk, society has a maximum level of risk that it is willing to tolerate while using innovations. In turn, the decisionmak- ing process is confined by cost considerations because of limited budgets for biosafety and biotechnology review processes. Policymakers may describe pol- icy options through risk and cost combinations offering society the same level of risk at a lower cost or the same level of cost but with a lower level of risk. These trade-offs highlight the need for societies to define a decisionmaking path that will guide their actions.
The idea that risk, benefits, and cost trade-offs need to be examined during the design and implementation phases of biosafety and biotechnology regula- tory processes is conceptually elegant and simple. However, actual risk assess- ment and eventual approval or rejection of a particular biotechnology is a complicated process. The safety profile of particular GE technologies consists of a portfolio of risk factors, each of which has a safety profile that may require its own decisionmaking process. For example, when examining food/feed safety, biosafety assessors may examine risk factors, such as allergenicity or tox- icity, whereas when examining environmental safety, they may consider impact on non-target organisms.
The multifactor characteristic of the biosafety profiles of most GE technol- ogies is further complicated as there may be different weights placed on each factor based on individual or institutional preferences. Regulators may deem the risk of one specific factor as unacceptable, whereas regulators may deem other risk factors as acceptable or manageable by risk-mitigation efforts. The multifactor characteristic of most GE technologies makes the cost–benefit and risk assessment much more difficult in practice.
Estimating the Cost of Compliance with Biosafety Regulations
Table 6.1 presents the four categories by which economists usually classify the social costs of regulations. These costs are listed in relative order of estimation from easiest to hardest. As an alternative, regulatory costs can be disaggregated into variable and fixed costs. Fixed costs are those that do not vary with the activity level of the research or production activity. In contrast, variable costs change with the level of activity. Regulations that impose high fixed costs on research institutions will hurt public-sector institutions (and small private firms), as they impose a higher per unit cost of research activity. Compared to private institutions, the public sector usually has more restrictive or less flexible budgets. Therefore, regulators need to consider “economies of scale” effects when designing and deploying biosafety regulations.

Although it is worth considering all potential costs of implementing bio- safety regulations, some costs are relatively easy to conceptualize but very
hard to quantify in practice. For example, the cost of rejecting projects that have potential social benefit will be difficult to measure. There are also other types of social costs that policymakers and regulators need to consider, such
as transitional, social welfare, or indirect costs, which are also difficult to esti- mate. An example would be the opportunity costs of Institutional Biosafety Committees and National Biosafety Committees. What is important to take into account is the need to acknowledge that regulatory design and implemen- tation has social costs and that there are trade-offs between innovation and regulatory intensity, especially if regulators move beyond what is needed to demonstrate safety.
Estimates of the Cost of Compliance with Biosafety Regulations
A handful of studies has documented the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations for a diverse set of countries and commodities. The cost evaluation used in many of the studies, particularly in developing countries with evolv- ing regulatory frameworks, is mostly of an ex ante type. Hence, these studies derive the project costs of compliance from “best guess” estimates. For the ex post studies, the data collection approach considers those activities earmarked as biosafety regulatory costs by the developer. The biosafety regulatory costs in the studies presented here focus on the real-resource compliance costs and do

A decade ago the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center and the Kenyan Agriculture Research Institute, with the support of what today
is known as Syngenta Foundation, launched the Insect-Resistant Maize for Africa (IRMA) project. The objective of the IRMA project was to develop through conventional and genetic-engineering methods maize varieties that are resistant to stem borers, a major pest in Kenya and other African countries south of the Sahara. In Kenya alone, estimates of this pest damage on maize production are approximately 14 percent, equivalent to 79 million US dollars (US$) (De Groote et al. 2004).
At the time of the project launch, biosafety regulations were only start- ing to take shape in Kenya. In 1998, a year before the launch of the IRMA project, the National Council for Science and Technology issued Regulations and Guidelines for Biosafety in Biotechnology and established the National Biosafety Committee (NBC), which is responsible for reviewing applications and setting guidelines for the Institutional Biosafety Committee.
In February 2000, scientists from the project submitted to the National Biosafety Committee their first application to import from Mexico leaf tissue from first-generation International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center events to screen their effectiveness against stem borers in Kenya. This required previous visits and inspections from the Kenyan Plant Health Inspectorate and the National Biosafety Committee (now known as the National Biosafety Authority of Kenya). Given that biosafety regulations were just starting to be put in place, it is not surprising that this application took more than a year
to process (Mugo et al. 2005). After this learning experience, as illustrated in Table 6.2, the cost of these applications dropped substantially, and the process- ing time decreased over the years.
During the first 6 years, the project remained in the contained stage. The estimated costs of this stage were close to 1 million US dollars (US$), as detailed in Table 6.3. The IRMA project continues its activities to date with a renewed focus on conventional approaches to incorporating insect resis- tance to borers. The IRMA project has been a learning process for regulators and scientists in Kenya, who have become familiarized with a biosafety assess- ment process (Mugo et al. 2011). The project has opened the doors to other GE crops that national regulators have reviewed since the original biosafety

Bt Cotton in Kenya
In an effort to revive the cotton sector in Kenya, the introduction of transgenic varieties has been one of the policies that scientists and policymakers have

an Act in February 2009 by the president of Kenya. Furthermore, Kenya now has a functional National Biosafety Authority and thus a comprehensive and functional regulatory system with the involvement of multiple agencies.

Scientists estimate that the African bollworm is the most damaging pest for cotton, and its control accounts for 30 percent of production costs, with yield losses that can reach up to 100 percent (AATF 2006; Waturu 2006). The Kenyan Agriculture Research Institute has been actively working on the introduction of insect-resistant (Bt) cotton varieties since 2001, and the first confined field trials started in 2006. Table 6.4 pre- sents the estimates for the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations for Bt cotton in Kenya. Cost estimates in the case of Kenya add up to approximately US$772,000.
Fungus-Resistant Bananas in Uganda
The National Research Organisation (NARO) of Uganda launched a joint project with the Agricultural Biotechnology Support Program II and the University of Leuven, Belgium, to develop a black Sigatoka–resistant banana for the Ugandan context. The GE option is part of a broader effort launched by NARO to develop bananas resistant not only to black Sigatoka but also to bac- terial blights, nematodes, and other severe productivity constraints for Ugandan agriculture by pursuing conventional and biotechnology means. The black Sigatoka–resistant product entered a confined field trial in 2008, approved by the National Biosafety Committee, under the supervision of NARO.
Table 6.5 includes an estimate of the potential costs of compliance with biosafety regulations for the case of black Sigatoka–resistant bananas in Uganda.3 These costs are similar to those for a nematode-resistant vari-

Costs for the black Sigatoka event are expected to be somewhat high com- pared to other events, due in part to the uniqueness of the event. There are very few instances of regulatory reviews of bananas and of fungal (or bacterial blight / nematode-resistance) traits. Nevertheless, if we compare the estimated costs stemming from regulations and R&amp;D to the potential gains from the technology (see Chapter 4), we can affirm that it is prudent to assess properly

this technology in order to enable the transfer of a safe and much-needed tech- nology to farmers.
Estimates from Other Countries
Table 6.6 summarizes earlier estimates of regulatory compliance costs from dif- ferent sources. Regulatory compliance costs varied across commodities and countries, ranging from US$500,000 for Bt cotton in India to US$4 million for soybeans in Brazil. These initial estimates of the costs of compliance with biosafety regulations were made based on the existing regulatory process at
the time of data collection. In some cases, these estimates are likely to change with changes in the regulatory process; therefore, they need to be updated over time. Regulatory cost estimates in Table 6.6 for technologies in develop- ing countries tend to be lower than the costs incurred by private companies for earlier technologies in the United States, as seen in Table 6.7.
As summarized in Table 6.7, estimates of regulatory costs in the United States in the private sector vary from US$7 million to US$15 million per single new product for first-generation products released into the country (Kalaitzandonakes, Alston, and Bradford 2007). There are several potential

explanations for the difference between the estimates of the cost of compliance presented here. These include cost underreporting by the public sector, lack of experience with earlier events, and the use of information generated in devel- oped countries for use in developing countries. Some of these estimates are subjective and may be a reflection of uncertainties about the regulatory process that may be followed to ensure compliance.
Table 6.8 introduces estimates for the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations in the Philippines and Indonesia. Values presented in this table are for a combination of costs incurred to the time data were being collected in addition to the best estimate of potential costs to completion. Similar to the situation in Table 6.7, the estimates presented in Table 6.8 tend to be low com- pared to other estimates in the literature, in part because these are technolo- gies approved in other countries, and thus developers were able to use—or are expecting to use—data generated elsewhere. Allowing the use of data gener- ated elsewhere helps reduce compliance costs.
The case of Bt maize in the Philippines is different, in part because this technology was one of the first to go through the regulatory approval process in the country. As a result, there was very little regulatory expe- rience with GM crops. Costs in the case of Bt maize are higher, because estimates in Table 6.8 consider the opportunity cost of using the infor- mation generated elsewhere by costing the relative value of maize to the

Philippines vis-à-vis global values (Manalo and Ramon 2007). If we disregard the opportunity costs for knowledge generated elsewhere, then we observe a reduced value comparable to the other crops shown in Table 6.8.
Values presented in Table 6.8 are similar to other estimates by Bayer, Norton, and Falck-Zepeda (2008). Their estimates for the Philippines show that the costs of compliance with biosafety regulations were similar or even larger than the development costs.4
Implications for Agriculture in African and Other Developing Countries
To date, only three countries have approved the commercial release of a GE crop (Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa). Other countries have—or are—conducting confined field trials, including Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Many more countries in Africa are considering developing their biosafety frameworks further to commercialize GE products after a bio- safety assessment. In this section, we describe the potential impact of the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations for African agriculture. Because of the limited experience completing the different stages of a regulatory process that culminates with the potential commercial release of an assessed prod- uct, we rely on experience in other countries and sectors to discuss poten-
tial impacts.
High regulatory costs are especially relevant for regulatory impact assess-
ment and technology decisionmaking efforts when they go beyond what
is needed to demonstrate safety. Certainly, developers may conduct several activities during the regulatory stage that have a specific objective apart from biosafety, including identifying early marketable products or addressing poten- tial liability concerns. Whether any cost is justifiable from a private or social investment standpoint will depend on its net contribution to social welfare. From the standpoint of regulatory impact assessment, concerns include in- efficiencies, duplications, and unnecessary procedures that do not contrib-
ute to regulatory objectives. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify additional activities that yield enhanced safety knowledge but at an increasingly declining rate, as they may not justify more investments. Identifying these costs is para- mount to improving the system.
4 Another study was done by Redenbaugh and McHughen (2004), who report that the cost of com- pliance with biosafety regulations in horticultural crops may be as low as US$1 million per allele but can be as high as US$5 million.
 
ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 173
The high compliance costs observed so far relate to relatively well- described crops and traits, where science has accumulated a large body of knowledge on which to base regulatory assessments. Scientific and regulatory knowledge from these approved GE crops spilled over to other countries, thus reducing the potential cost needed to generate new information for similar or related technologies. Unfortunately, it is likely that current estimates for regu- latory compliance costs represent a lower boundary for the expected costs for new crops and traits that will enter the regulatory pipeline in the near future. Although the opportunity arises of learning from existing regulatory pro- cesses to improve their efficiency, and the cost of performing individual scien- tific assessments may be declining over time, these trends may not be sufficient to balance the expected cost increase for novel products or traits entering the regulatory pipeline. Of course, the ability of knowledge to flow among coun- tries provides a rationale for regional efforts to coordinate or harmonize assess- ments and decisionmaking processes.
Direct Cost Impacts
The high cost of compliance with biosafety regulations can affect public and private crop-improvement investments in different ways. The most obvious outcome is that a high compliance cost may reduce, ceteris paribus, investment in the development of regulated products and thus reduce the flow of poten- tially valuable products reaching farmers. In Africa, the impact of high regu- latory costs may be more relevant to decisionmaking than elsewhere, as the likelihood exists that the regulatory systems in the continent may deal with crops and traits that have high social value in terms of benefits, but there may not be experience with or knowledge about the risk assessment.
These include crops like cassava, sweet potatoes, and bananas; or traits like viral and fungal resistance. However, risk assessment is a process that follows a set of well-defined steps identifying potential risk, likelihoods, and dam- age. This process has been validated through extensive risk-assessment expe- rience not only with GE crops but also with pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other chemicals. The scope then exists for developing robust systems in Africa that will respond to regulatory challenges in direct relation to the level of
risk involved.
A more subtle outcome of high compliance costs is that, compared to unregulated products, public and private organizations may require a higher social/private rate of return for these regulated products as they carry greater R&amp;D risks for developers. This outcome may have the unintended conse- quence of forcing developers to concentrate—and evaluate in more detail the

174 CHAPTER 6
potential impact—on higher return products, but because of budget con- straints, African developers may forgo projects that might have high social returns over time but require a significant level of financial resources up front. Furthermore, high compliance costs may force the public sector with very lim- ited annual budgets to refocus research efforts on unregulated products. In addition, the private (and even the public) sector may concentrate on those commodities with more innate private-return characteristics compared to crops of public interest. Certainly, the private sector focused on just four GE crops for the first generation of products after the marketability of their prod- ucts was affected by regulatory costs and uncertainty.
Time Value of Money
A regulatory process extends the time needed to release a product for com- mercial purposes. Although this outcome is inevitable for regulatory processes, the core issue is to separate those regulatory activities needed to demonstrate safety from those added due to regulatory inefficiencies. Investments made during product conceptualization and R&amp;D usually are done in advance of the regulatory process. Developers need to recuperate these investments as soon as possible because of the customary preference to have a return now rather than later. As time goes by, money itself “loses” its value at a discount rate deter- mined by the time value of money to society or private interests.
Lack of clarity about regulatory requirements, scheduling, and other tim- ing issues; restrictions on coordinating R&amp;D and biosafety activities; limita- tions in terms of regulatory capacity of the competent authority; and other factors can compound the impact of regulatory delays. Delays beyond what would be needed to assess a product defer the onset of the stream of benefits generated through farmer adoption. Although there is very limited experience with assessing such delays in Africa, below we present a summary of studies in Uganda and in the Philippines, which show the critical need for reducing reg- ulatory gaps and the importance of coordination to ensure prompt and effi- cient regulatory processes that deliver safe products.
The study by Kikulwe, Wesseler, and Falck-Zepeda (2008) examined the impact on social benefits from the introduction of a GE black Sigatoka– resistant banana in Uganda (see Chapter 4). This ex ante study incorporates irreversible cost and benefits using the real options approach. Results from this study show that if an approval delay occurs, Uganda forgoes potential social benefits of approximately US$179–365 million per year. Furthermore, assuming a maximum planting area of 541,530 hectares with a GE banana in Uganda, maximum total costs to bring the GE banana to Ugandan producers

ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 175
cannot exceed US$108 million. Otherwise, the GM banana is not a viable alternative. Results from this study show that regulatory delays and the total cost of development are substantial and need to be taken into account.
Figure 6.2 summarizes the results of the study by Bayer, Norton,
and Falck-Zepeda (2008). This study examined the impact of increases in the cost of compliance with biosafety regulations and of regulatory delays on net benefits generated from the potential adoption of Bt eggplant, virus- resistant tomatoes, Bt rice, and virus-resistant papaya in the Philippines. Results showed that increases of up to 400 percent with respect to the

estimated base cost of compliance with biosafety regulations did not affect sig- nificantly the net present value of benefits from potential farmer adoption. In contrast, relatively small regulatory delays of 1–3 years reduced significantly the net present value of benefits from farmer adoption. This effect was espe- cially significant in the case of tomatoes, eggplant, and papaya.
Entry Barriers and Regulatory Uncertainty
Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety have chosen to pursue a bio- safety assessment for GE crops before deliberate release into the environ- ment. Most non-parties have also implemented a biosafety regulatory system based on existing regulations or through new national laws and regulations. Regulations carry financial and time costs that countries need to incur in order to guarantee the safety of their citizens. The problem arises when concerns
not related to safety are added to these regulations, which turns the process into a serious hurdle for technology decisionmaking. In essence, the regula- tory process may increase costs beyond what developers and society consider reasonable. In some cases, the turning point may be achieved when addi- tional investments in biosafety assessments return reduced amounts of addi- tional safety.
Excessively high regulatory compliance costs constitute a barrier to entry, especially for smaller organizations and the public sector when they are high enough to have an impact on investment decisions. This is true especially when organizations face budget constraints. Furthermore, in those coun-
tries where there is high regulatory uncertainty—in terms of not knowing how, if, and when a product may complete a regulatory process—the public and private sectors may reduce their levels of investment as they are less pre- pared to deal with investment uncertainty, which complicates decisionmaking under risk.
In a decisionmaking process under risk, R&amp;D organizations typically contrast the cost of R&amp;D and compliance with the probability of obtain-
ing an approval for commercialization and the potential market returns
from deploying a product; they then make an investment decision based on the risk-weighted returns. In the public sector, the focus is not on profit but rather on social return; thus, these organizations face a similar decisionmak- ing process.5 In contrast, when R&amp;D organization must make decisions under
5 Regulatory costs can also be considered as sunk costs once developers make investments in advance of knowing the outcome. Thus, developers would not factor them into the decisionmak- ing process once the investment is made. This old conundrum relates to whether analysts con- sider costs ex ante or ex post. There is no consensus among economists with regard to this issue.
 
ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 177
uncertainty, the decisionmaking process becomes quite difficult and may represent a binding constraint for organizations examining investment for product development.
Although relatively high investments are needed to conduct biotechnology R&amp;D, the costs appear to be declining significantly over time. In spite of the cost reductions for some activities, initial investments to develop biotechnol- ogy programs continue to be a barrier to entry for smaller organizations and the public sector in Africa and in other developing countries. The same holds for biosafety, as investment costs in buildings, equipment, laboratory capac- ity, and other capital investments can be onerous for developing countries. The pressing need exists to examine whether specific investments in biosafety are actually required to assess safety or the appropriateness of the technology development process, vis-à-vis the current innovation development stage in the country.
There are many strategies to reduce cost without sacrificing safety. Developers and regulators can use information generated in another coun- try (or within the same country) in order to guide the biosafety assessment of a particular event. In addition, the regulatory system may reduce the required information needed by identifying activities that add no value for assessing safety. Assessors may consider identifying specific risk considerations that do not contribute to the risk profile of the technology. Alternatively, develop- ers can conduct some of the more expensive food/feed safety tests in coun- tries where it is less costly. As long as regulations or laws governing the process remain unchanged, costs will decrease as developers and regulators become more experienced and more events go through the regulatory process.
Sources of Funding
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, researchers should not stop their research projects on the basis of the high costs of compliance without taking into con- sideration the relative importance of these estimates to the total cost of devel- opment, the importance of the crop and its trait for national interests, and the estimated level of benefits that may be achieved by using the technology. The latter issue connects with the damage averted or gains made from using the technology. Furthermore, researchers need to take into account how compli- ance costs have changed over time.
In the absence of other considerations, if developers have a high-
value product—especially those in the public sector with significant value for resource-poor farmers—then the relatively high R&amp;D costs (including those for biosafety assessment) have to be contrasted with whether it pays to

178 CHAPTER 6
invest in such technologies and who will pay for it. In other words, if a particu- lar technology demonstrates a real positive public value, then identifying the entity that will pay for bringing this technology to farmers is key in the deci- sionmaking process
Unfortunately, public research budgets face the current declining trends in R&amp;D investments seen not only in Africa but also in other regions. This situ- ation contrasts with the pressing needs that accelerating climate change and additional population pressure will bring to African countries, on top of the existing lags in innovation investment. Although the international research system and some developed countries have expressed their will to support ongoing innovation activities, support has not fully materialized.

Modern biotechnology needs to be a part of the tools used for effective pov- erty alleviation in Africa. As GE crops and other products are regulated products, it is imperative to establish regulatory systems that are commen- surate with the potential risk of the technology. These systems should be not only flexible enough to adapt to gains in knowledge and experience, but also transparent and fair, and take into consideration all aspects of a broad and inclusive decisionmaking process. Biosafety systems that are too cum- bersome or inflexible and those that become an insurmountable hurdle will stop this technology in its tracks, even those that have an elevated potential to resolve specific productivity issues of African agriculture. Biosafety thus becomes a process that considers all costs, benefits, and risks of prospective technologies within the scope of overall sustainable agricultural and eco- nomic development.
So far, GE crops that have been released deliberately have had a remark- able safety record. No proven damage to human health or the environment has been documented for any of the approved GE crops. Science academies
in Europe and the United States, international agencies, and national and regional regulatory agencies officially endorse this safety record. However, novel crops and traits that will enter the regulatory pipeline may present a new set of challenges for regulatory agencies and biosafety systems.
Biosafety regulatory systems assess, manage, and communicate the objective risks posed by GE crops to human health, the environment, and biodiversity. Benefits and costs from the potential introduction of the tech- nology have only received a cursory attention by most regulatory systems.

ESTIMATES AND IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH BIOSAFETY REGULATIONS 179
Furthermore, failing to adopt new technologies that may benefit poor farm- ers and consumers carries its own set of risks (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2003). Undesirable conventional agricultural production practices may result in overexposure to chemical pesticides or incomplete abatement of pest damage, negatively affecting food safety and security. Biosafety regula- tory systems thus need to balance objective risks to human health and the environment against the potential risk of opportunity losses to increase agri- cultural production, introduce novel crops, and enhance the livelihoods of poor people.
The key to delivering safe, valuable, and appropriate GE technologies to farmers in poor countries is smart and efficient regulatory systems imple- mentable by countries with lower scientific and financial capacity. Developing countries need such a system, which does not necessarily mean more biosafety regulations. Regulations have to be based on risk-assessment procedures with a history of success in other countries. Many international documents articulate biosafety, risk assessment, and risk management principles; a specific example is Annex III to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Furthermore, establish- ing sensible regulations does not have to be complicated, as long as the process is robust, transparent, and participative ( Jaffe 2006). Most importantly, bio- safety needs to be a process trusted by society. Several policy and regulatory system options are available for improving biosafety processes.
African and other developing countries eventually will need to decide whether biotechnology and GE crops are useful for their development pro- cesses. This decision will be—hopefully—based on information on likely and actual impacts from biotechnology adoption and use (see, for example, Smale et al. 2009). Furthermore, developing countries need to realize that excessively precautionary approaches to biosafety regulations will have an impact on the flow of potentially valuable biotechnologies reaching farmers. All countries have the sovereign right to decide whether to embrace or reject this technol- ogy, but it is desirable that such decisions consider all costs, benefits, and risks involved with this technology. For those countries that are considering adopt- ing GE crops, proper biosafety and technology assessments will help ensure the reduction of the costs and risks while maximizing the benefits.

Policy, Investment, and Partnerships for Agricultural Biotechnology Research in Africa: Emerging Evidence
David J. Spielman and Patricia Zambrano
The past decade has seen vociferous debate over genetically engineered (GE) crops and their potential contribution to Africa’s development. Although the initial debates revolved primarily around whether such technologies should be introduced, recent debates have become far more nuanced. Today, the discourse addresses such questions as what types of public policies can make GE crops and other applications of agricultural biotechnol- ogy (agbiotech) more readily available to researchers, farmers, and consum- ers in Africa. This chapter examines the extent to which public policies across the African continent are enabling the research, development, and dissemina- tion of GE crops. The chapter does so by drawing on data from two studies on issues relating to the design and execution of such policies.
The first section reviews the literature on key issues in agbiotech research, development, and deployment, with specific reference to Africa. The next one describes the two studies on agbiotech in developing countries, with findings from these studies presented in the subsequent section. A set of actionable pol- icy recommendations is then provided, followed by concluding remarks that offer insights to the future of GE crops and agbiotech in, and for, Africa.
Tracking Agbiotech’s Evolution
The growing body of literature on the state of agbiotech in Africa includes three main areas of inquiry: (1) studies that track the development and com- mercialization of GE crops in the region; (2) studies that follow the devel- opment of biosafety regulations and related legislation for managing the release of GE crops in the region; and (3) studies of the size, types, and con- straints to investment in research, development, and dissemination of GE crops by the public and private sectors. The literature in each of these areas is reviewed here.

184 CHAPTER 7
Tracking the Introduction of GE Crops
The literature that tracks the development and application of GE crops
is highlighted by several key sources. The first and most widely used
source of information is the International Service for the Acquisition
of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a global initiative that publishes peri- odic data and analyses of GE crop adoption worldwide. The information assembled by this initiative, along with its in-depth analyses of key trends and developments at the global, regional, and country levels (see, for example, ISAAA 2009), is possibly the most widely referenced source on these partic- ular topics. A recent ISAAA global overview by James (2011) shows that in 2011, 160 million hectares of land across 29 countries worldwide were under GE crop cultivation, and the number of developing countries that had adopted GE crops totaled 18 (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Honduras, India, Mexico, Myanmar, Pakistan, Paraguay, the Philippines, South Africa, and Uruguay). Of these 18 countries, only 3 were in Africa: Burkina Faso, Egypt, and South Africa. In fact, South Africa was the only African country listed by ISAAA as planting GE crops up until 2008, when Egypt and Burkina Faso joined the list with the commercial- ization of Bt maize and Bt cotton, respectively.
A second source for GE crops is the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations online Database of Biotechnologies in Use in Developing Countries (FAO-BioDeC). This database monitors trends in the develop- ment, adoption, and application of agbiotechs in developing countries (FAO 2011). For crop biotechnology FAO-BioDeC currently lists 3,104 products, of which 1,092 are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a total of 50 countries. For countries in Africa south of the Sahara, only 11 are listed, with a total of 66 GMO crop products (Table 7.1). Most products are listed under South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria.
A third source is the Center for Environmental Risk Assessment (CERA) database, formerly hosted by Agbios, a Canadian initiative that assembled detailed information on the global state of GE crop approvals by specific event (Agbios 2009).1 The latest CERA database provides a list of 144 events that have been approved by national regulatory bodies from 23 countries and the European Union. In line with the data from James (2011), the only countries listed in CERA from Africa south of the Sahara are South Africa and Burkina Faso—South Africa with 25 approved products for cotton, maize, canola
1 “Event” refers here to the stable incorporation of foreign DNA into a living plant cell to create a potentially unique crop and trait combination.

and soybean, and 1 for Burkina Faso with the recently commercialized cotton (CERA 2011).
A fourth source is bEcon, a web-based bibliography maintained by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) of the applied econom- ics literature that documents the impacts of GE crops in developing countries (Yerramareddy and Zambrano 2011). Whereas other sources of information focus primarily on the commercialization of GE crops and the regulatory regimes that promote or impede commercialization, bEcon and an accompany- ing literature by Smale et al. (2009) offer additional insights into the costs and benefits of agbiotech to farmers and consumers.
Analysis from these sources also suggests a mixed record of impact to date. Although James (2011) and others are generally optimistic about the gains from the rapid diffusion of insect-resistant (Bt) cotton and other trait/crop combinations, Smale et al. (2009) offer a mixed report on economic outcomes. They caution that positive findings in terms of cost reductions and yield improvements for Bt cotton in China and India should not be generalized to other traits, crops, and countries, and that more extensive and comprehensive research is needed to better understand the impacts of GE crops in develop- ing countries.

186 CHAPTER 7
Tracking Biosafety Legislation and Regulation
Studies of developments in the field of biosafety legislation and regulation in Africa are generally in-depth examinations on governance issues relating to the research, development, and dissemination of GE crops to researchers, farm- ers, and consumers in Africa. Key studies in this area include Baum, de Kathen, and Ryan (2001); Johanson and Ives (2001); Mugabe (2002); Alhassan (2003); Sithole-Niang, Cohen, and Zambrano (2004); Harsh (2005); Wafula and Clark (2005); and Karembu, Nguthi, and Abdel-Hamid (2009). These studies assess a range of regulatory issues, such as the health and environmen- tal risks of GE crop cultivation, the costs and benefits of agbiotech regulation, transparency and accountability issues in regulating GE crops, and challenges related to capacity strengthening to support the design and implementation of biosafety regulations.
Studies on the broader governance issues, including the political and political economy aspects of agbiotech and their influence on national regulatory systems in Africa (and in other developing countries) are offered by Komen, Webber, and Mignouna (2000); Paarlberg (2001); Cohen and Paarlberg (2004); Cohen (2005); Pray, Bengali, and Ramaswami (2005); and Birner and Linacre (2008), among others. A conclusion that can be drawn from these studies is that timely advancement of agbiotech and GE crop research, and its effective use to address local problems in agriculture, is often hampered in countries where approvals are few and far between, where political interest groups advocate against the design and implementation of agbiotech policies and regulations, or where the capacity of the country’s research and regulatory systems is limited.
Interestingly, although data reported earlier indicate that research and approval of GE crops in Africa is progressing at a sluggish rate, there is evi- dence suggesting that more progress has been made regarding the estab- lishment of functional regulatory frameworks. In 2004, only five countries (Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe) had national bio-
safety policies in place: by 2009, this figure had increased to include Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, and Zimbabwe (Karembu, Nguthi, and Abdel-Hamid 2009). Investment in the development of viable regulatory systems and the capacity to manage them has received a boost from the international community, with sig- nificant flows of resources originating from the US Agency for International Development (though the Program on Biosafety Systems and Agricultural Biotechnology Support Project II), the United Nations Environment Program–Global Environmental Facility, the World Bank, and others.

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 187
Regional initiatives and organizations in Africa—the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research
in Eastern and Central Africa, the Economic Community of West African States, the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development, the Permanent Inter-State Committee for the Fight against Drought in the Sahel, and others—have also played a central role in strength- ening capacity for biosafety regulation and facilitating the regional harmoni- zation of biosafety regulations. These advances have been made in spite of the significant variation in how individual countries frame and execute their bio- safety regulations (Spielman, Cohen, and Zambrano 2006a,b).
Tracking Public and Private Investment in Agbiotech
Studies of the levels, types, and constraints on investment in research, devel- opment, and dissemination of GE crops are a barometer of what is coming through the pipeline for Africa. Studies on public expenditure on agri- cultural research and development (R&amp;D) are particularly useful in this context. Drawing on data from the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators initiative online database, Pardey et al. (2006) find that most African countries faced declining or stagnating growth rates of public invest- ment in agricultural R&amp;D between the 1970s and 1990s. Beintema and Stads (2006), using data from the same database, estimate that the growth rate of public expenditure on agricultural R&amp;D had declined from 2.0 per- cent in the 1970s to only 0.8 percent in the 1990s. Excluding South Africa and Nigeria from their sample—where R&amp;D expenditures grew during the 1990s—total spending in the region actually declined by 0.2 percent per year, resulting in a halving of average spending per scientist (Beintema and Stads 2006). A complementary study by Falck-Zapeda et al. (2003) suggests that R&amp;D specifically related to agbiotech represents a tiny fraction of these figures; it is concentrated primarily in South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt and is often highly dependent on donor funding. More recent evidence from Beintema and Stads (2011) indicates that although public R&amp;D spend-
ing growth has recovered in the region between 2001 and 2008, growth has been concentrated in only a few countries and generally driven by staff salary increases and infrastructure rehabilitation, with little indication of growth in biotechnology investments.
Studies of private investment in the research, development, and dissemi- nation of GE crops are also an important barometer of what is in store for

188 CHAPTER 7
Africa. At the global level, investment in agbiotech research is not insignifi- cant. Estimates suggest that private investment in plant biotechnology by
the leading multinational companies during the mid-1990s totaled approxi- mately 1 billion US dollars (US$) per year, a figure that amounts to roughly half of all global expenditure on agbiotech R&amp;D (Byerlee and Fischer 2001; Pray and Naseem 2003). However, most of these expenditures were concen- trated on crops, traits, and technologies directly relevant to industrialized country farming. Again, only a minute fraction of this expenditure is immedi- ately relevant to Africa, a finding that Spielman (2007) suggests does not bode well for small-scale, resource-poor farmers in the region, although Pingali and Traxler (2002) are more sanguine.
But at a more local level, private investment in agbiotech is defined
and constrained by the effectiveness and efficiency of seed systems and markets—beginning from varietal approval processes and ending with the distribution of improved cultivars to farmers. Functional seed systems are critical, because they are the channel through which many agbiotech appli- cations will be deployed and disseminated in Africa. However, seed systems are, by their nature, subject to a variety of unique market and institutional constraints (Tripp and Louwaars 1997; Gisselquist and Van der Meer 2001; Tripp 2001).
First, problematic property rights result from the fact that improved seeds can, in many cases, be reproduced by the farmer, thus reducing the ability of breeders to appropriate the gains from their innovative activities and invest- ments. Second, information asymmetries result from the inability of farmers to make ex ante assessments of seed quality, because such knowledge is held only by the seller in the absence of certain types of regulation. Third, coor- dination problems result from difficulties of enforcing and monitoring con- tracts for seed use: farmers often save and exchange seed without the breeder’s knowledge. Finally, inelastic supply responses result from the inability of breeders to respond effectively to rapid changes in seed demand from farm- ers: often, farmers may reassess their seed type and quantity requirements just prior to planting based on expectations of rainfall, market prices, and other factors—decisions taken long after breeders have bulked up seed quantities for distribution.
Although seed systems may exist in Africa where markets for a given crop are well developed (for example, maize in Kenya), they are more often weak or otherwise incomplete due to the constraints noted above. Seed systems for “orphan” crops of marginal commercial value but of critical importance to subsistence farming—for example, sorghum, millet, groundnuts, pigeonpea,

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 189
cassava, or sweet potatoes—are rarely functional in the region, primarily because of the combined weakness of the markets for these commodities, the nonappropriability of varietal improvements under current technological and legal regimes, and limited incentives to commercialize public research on vari- etal improvements in most countries (Tripp 2000, 2001). Thus, the market and institutional failures pose a significant barrier to the entry and growth of private seed firms that could potentially commercialize, market, and distrib- ute varietal improvements resulting from public research. This is a major dis- incentive to increasing investment in GE crops and agbiotech research across the region.
One way of potentially bridging these systemic and market failures is to simultaneously draw on the assets and experiences of both the public and pri- vate sectors to develop and deploy GE crops in Africa. Studies by Pray (2001); Dubock (2003); Hall (2005); Spielman and Von Grebmer (2004); Chataway (2005); and Spielman, Hartwich, and von Grebmer (2007, 2010a,b) suggest that public–private partnerships (PPPs)—broadly described as any activity in which public and private entities jointly plan and execute activities with a view to accomplishing mutually agreed-on objectives while sharing the costs, risks, and benefits incurred in the process—represent an innovative approach to promoting agbiotech and GE crop R&amp;D in developing countries.
R&amp;D partnerships rely on processes of knowledge sharing, resource pool- ing, cost minimization, scale economies, and joint learning to generate syner- gies in conducting advanced research, commercializing new technologies, and deploying new products. Ideally, these synergies result in research outcomes of greater quantity; with a greater chance of success; or at lower cost than pub- lic, private, or civil society actors could expect when acting independently.
If the research is strategically focused on the needs of marginalized social groups, outcomes may ultimately translate into significant social and eco- nomic benefits.
Partnerships are particularly useful to larger or more advanced systems that require access to cutting-edge research tools, proprietary knowledge, or other types of information and data; and to smaller systems that do not have the scale economies to conduct independent research efficiently (Byerlee and Fischer 2001). In recognition of this potential, key public-sector actors are engaged in several partnerships focusing on enhancing yields or nutritional content of such crops as rice, wheat, and cassava. In Africa, PPPs include research projects on Bt maize, water-efficient maize, Bt cowpeas, and disease- resistant bananas and plantains (see AATF 2009). PPPs in livestock vaccine development have also played a role in bringing agbiotech to bear on Africa’s

190 CHAPTER 7
development; public–private research networks also exist for cassava and other crops (Smith 2005; Aerni 2006; Spielman 2009).
In many cases, members of the CGIAR Consortium play an important role in convening these projects and networks; mobilizing resources; and con- ducting research in close partnership with national research systems, multi- national crop-science firms, and local seed firms. These projects and networks are expected to deliver beneficial outcomes over the next decade, although it remains unclear to what extent the partnership approach is yielding the antici- pated outcomes.
Data, Data Sources, and Methods
This chapter examines agbiotech and GE crop research using data from two separate studies on agricultural R&amp;D. The studies—each backed by its own survey instrument and data—provide some new evidence on the policy envi- ronments in agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa.
Next Harvest 2002
The first study, titled Next Harvest, was initiated in 2002 by IFPRI and the International Service for National Agricultural Research (see Atanassov et al. 2004). It was conducted to determine expectations and limitations on publicly researched GE crops and traits. The study was conducted based on an expert survey distributed to a purposeful sampling of 76 researchers and regulators working in public organizations in 16 developing countries. The sample was designed to capture the extensive variation in the type and state of research in different countries and organizations, and to ensure that rel- evant knowledge, experiences, and insight were provided to participants. Information on 209 GE crop products under development was received through the year 2003, along with the type of transgenes deployed, tech- niques used to deploy transgenes, types and sources of germplasm used, stage of regulatory approval reached, type of collaboration used to conduct the research, and plans for dissemination of research outputs. Fifty-four of the 209 products (26 percent) were attributable to GE research in African coun- tries (Table 7.2).
Public–Private Partnerships 2006
The second study was undertaken by IFPRI in 2006 to examine partner- ships between private firms and the members of the CGIAR Consortium

(see Spielman, Hartwich, and von Grebmer 2007, 2010a,b). The study
used four specific tools—document analysis of PPP-related materials, semi- structured interviews with key informants engaged in partnership-based proj- ects, an email survey of CGIAR centers, and development of a functional typology of partnerships—to identify and analyze 75 CGIAR partnerships that were active in 2004 (Table 7.3). A total of 12 out of 15 centers responded to the survey and follow-up queries that were focused on the purpose, part- ners, outcomes, duration, and budgets of center PPPs. The survey also used these tools to provide a more in-depth analysis of 6 partnership-based projects at 4 separate CGIAR centers. A total of 14 projects (19 percent of all PPPs) in 5 centers (33 percent of all centers) involved agbiotech in some sense, with half of these partnerships engaging leading crop-science companies in the sector. Only 2 of these agbiotech projects were being conducted in Africa, although the remaining 12 projects covered crops and traits that were also potentially relevant to Africa. The first project is the Insect-Resistant Maize for Africa project undertaken by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Syngenta Foundation, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, and others. The second is the East Coast Fever vaccine development project undertaken by the International Livestock Research Institute, Merial, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, and others.2
2 Since 2006, one new PPP involving agbiotech—the Water-Efficient Maize for Africa project— has been launched. This brings the total number of PPPs in agbiotech research in Africa to three. Other agbiotech PPPs may also exist in the region; however, no new survey has been conducted since 2006 to document them.

Key Findings
Findings from these two studies indicate that even though a growing num- ber of countries in Africa are developing the necessary regulatory systems to support agribiotech research and GE crops, the actual research, development, and deployment of such products is lagging, largely because neither public- nor private-sector resources are being brought to bear in Africa, thus slowing the pace of innovation. These findings confirm those from other studies men- tioned earlier, but they delve somewhat deeper into both the causes and conse- quences. This is examined in detail below.

Insights from Next Harvest
A key finding of the 2004 Next Harvest study was that public research institu- tions in developing countries have conducted a significant number of diverse crop transformations to express a wide variety of crop groups and transgenes.3 However, although relatively large numbers of products were recorded in Asia and Latin America, the only African countries with any significant number of transformations were Egypt and South Africa. The situation has not changed substantially over the past 5 years, although a few countries have been added to the set of countries developing these technologies.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
When classified by crop type, more than half (55 percent) of all public trans- formations recorded by the Next Harvest study were concentrated among
15 crops that are critical to achieving sustainable food security and reducing poverty in developing countries. The remaining 45 percent of products were focused on cotton, vegetables, and fruits—crops of a more commercial nature. For Africa, the predominant crop group in all 54 products was cereals, fol- lowed by vegetables, roots and tubers, and sugar, with each group representing a fairly diverse set of crop species. The greatest numbers of products among all 11 crops were for maize (17.0 percent), potatoes (13.0 percent), and sugar and tomatoes (11.0 percent each).
With regard to regulatory progress, most of these products remained confined to the experimental stage of laboratory and greenhouse trials; fewer have advanced to later stages in the regulatory process, such as field trials for biosafety testing, scaling-up for wider environmental and efficacy testing; or commercialization for release to farmers. Overall, African coun- tries lagged slightly behind their Asian and Latin American counterparts: whereas 70 percent of all products in the African countries surveyed were still at the experimental stage, only 60 percent were at a similar stage in Asia and Latin America.
MAIN RESEARCH ACTORS
Most of the surveyed public organizations worked in isolation from other research actors, both public and private. In the study, only 7 percent of trans- formation products generated by these organizations were conducted in col- laboration with the private sector, and only 22 percent were generated in
3 Findings based on data from the Next Harvest survey are reported in Atanassov et al. (2004); Sithole-Niang, Cohen, and Zambrano (2004); Cohen (2005); and Spielman, Cohen, and Zambrano (2006a,b). However, the findings presented here update these findings with additional analysis of the data and offer new insights from more recent research.

collaborations between or among public institutions (Table 7.4). In Africa,
the distribution of involvement was somewhat different: half (52 percent) of all transformation products were from a single public institution, whereas the others were from public–private (22.5 percent), public–public (13 percent), or some other type of collaboration (2 percent). Africa also had more represen- tation from the private sector regarding origin of genetic materials. Although only 5 percent of all surveyed transformation products relied on genetic mate- rials derived from local or foreign private-sector materials, 15 percent of all materials used in Africa originated from the private sector.
TRAITS OF GE CROPS
In terms of transgenes and gene groups, the figures suggest that agbiotech and GE crop research may be limited in focus with respect to the particular biotic and abiotic stresses facing agriculture in many developing countries. Fungal, bacterial, and other types of resistance are still at very preliminary stages of research for developing-country crops and agroecologies, whereas herbi-
cide tolerance, insect resistance, and virus resistance—originally designed for the needs of industrialized-country agriculture—continue to dominate the research pipeline.
REGULATORY PROCESSES
In terms of regulatory progress, the figures indicate that forward movement in agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa is limited to very few countries and that research in those countries is only now reaching the initial stages of the regulatory process. Even though agbiotech may shorten the time needed to identify transgenes and transform plants, the resulting GE crop still requires time for scaling up, efficacy trials, environmental testing, and other regulatory
47 15 8 6
 
POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 195
requirements particular to genetic modification. Agbiotech research in Africa has not moved far along this road.
This reality is, according to many survey respondents, worsened by the fact that some countries have subjected GE crops to multiple years of testing— resulting in significant waiting periods for approvals for scale-up or pre- commercial trials—or have only interim guidelines or regulations in place
that do not allow for commercial approvals. Even those countries that do have the ability to evaluate GE crops and provide commercial approvals often lack confidence in their commercial decisionmaking. Others may be facing such limitations as growers’ inability to produce adequate amounts of seed for large- scale or food-safety testing.
PUBLIC- AND PRIVATE-SECTOR INTERACTION
The relatively small role attributable to the private sector in agbiotech and GE crop research in African countries suggests that public–private research collab- orations face significant barriers to implementation. This absence of collabora- tion could pose difficulties for public institutions as they advance crops from research to regulatory approval and commercialization. Without exchanges of valuable regulatory data from private firms and other research institutions that have conducted transformations of similar crops and/or traits in industrialized countries, public institutions are poorly equipped to navigate the regulatory and commercialization processes with full information. Without scientific interaction and information exchanges between sectors, many of the public researchers who will be tapped for biosafety committees, regulatory agencies, or advisory bodies will be similarly less qualified to provide real expertise.
Insights from the IFPRI Study on PPPs
The 2006 IFPRI study on PPPs provides additional useful insights into inter- actions between the public and private sectors. This section highlights find- ings that relate to the main actors and their objectives, project costs and benefits, risk and risk-management strategies, and safe stewardship.4
MAIN ACTORS AND OBJECTIVES
A key finding of the 2006 IFPRI study was that multinational or foreign firms are engaged in only half of the 14 PPP-based projects that involved
4 The findings are based on data from the 2006 IFPRI study as reported in Spielman, Cohen, and Zambrano (2006a,b); Spielman, Hartwich, and von Grebmer (2007); and Spielman (2009). However, the findings presented here contain new analyses of the data and new findings that build on the previous work.
 
196 CHAPTER 7
agbiotech, with the rest of these partnerships engaging local (typically
seed) firms. And where multinational or foreign firms were engaged with
a CGIAR center, the majority of such partnerships tended to be monoga- mous in nature, that is, involving only the center and the firm, without addi- tional participation from other research organizations or firms. The projects involving multinational or foreign firms (for example, Monsanto, Syngenta, and Pioneer Hi-Bred International) were primarily designed to facilitate technology transfers and negotiate the use of intellectual property owned
by the private-sector partner. In general, these projects did not leverage
other private-sector assets, such as scientific expertise in working with agbio- tech research tools or expertise in navigating regulatory processes to bring research into commercial use. In other words, few CGIAR centers engaged the private sector to conduct frontier research or to form ventures where pub- lic and private actors jointly undertake cutting-edge research activities charac- terized by some unknown probability of success. In Africa, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center’s Insect-Resistant Maize for Africa project has primarily followed this model by first leveraging the private sector as a source of project funding and by later transferring events from the private to the public sector. In contrast, the East Coast Fever vaccine development project involved a higher level of research engagement between the principal organizations—the International Livestock Research Institute and Merial— which can be described as a form of frontier research.
PROJECT COSTS AND BENEFITS
Ideally, the purpose of a PPP-based research project is to lower the costs of research relative to the potential benefits by synergizing both public and pri- vate assets. Although ex ante cost–benefit analyses were not conducted or published for many of the PPP projects identified in the 2006 IFPRI study, findings do suggest that for all agbiotech PPPs (including the two cases from Africa), the projects allowed public researchers to conduct research that would have been prohibitively costly had the public sector been working in isolation. The PPP approach allowed public researchers to access financial resources and useful technologies from the private sector that would have been otherwise unavailable in the public domain.
However, findings also suggest that the coordination costs associated with the partnerships—the costs incurred in searching for partners, maintaining partner commitment, and resolving conflicts among partners—were non- trivial. Although it is difficult to quantify the costs of PPP coordination, find- ings strongly suggest that within-partnership coordination costs are a major

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 197
challenge to successful PPPs. Findings suggest that the two agbiotech PPPs in Africa were no exception to this.
RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Research projects, whether conducted by the public or private sector, are often risky ventures. In the context of agbiotech, these risks may relate to the general environment in which research is conducted, for example, disruptions caused by negative public opinions on GE crops. Or the risks may be specific to the project and related to the probability that the research process will not yield
a successful output or product, will not yield a success within a time horizon that encourages continued investment, or will not yield a product that can pass through legal and regulatory hurdles associated with moving from proof of concept to commercial deployment.
Findings from the 2006 IFPRI study suggest that the agbiotech PPPs are poorly equipped to manage risks associated with the project, whether finan- cial, reputational, or otherwise. This observation is particularly relevant for the two projects in Africa, both of which were initially unable to develop viable products after 5–10 years of research and had to undergo significant changes in project design to continue the research. The financial and reputational risks of limited research outcomes were likely significant in such instances, although efforts to mitigate them have been fairly successful in these examples.5
SAFE STEWARDSHIP
Related to the issue of risk is that of safe stewardship of proprietary technolo- gies and materials used in agbiotech research. Findings from the 2006 IFPRI study suggest that safe stewardship may be the key issue for private-sector part- ners looking to engage with public research organizations in agbiotech research in and for developing countries. Concerns revolve around the legal, financial, and reputational risks that could result from the misuse or abuse of agbiotech tools or materials from partners in public research organizations or by third parties that gain unsanctioned access to these tools and materials.
Findings suggest that legal and contractual strategies—indemnifications and disclaimers, for instance—offer private firms some degree of protection. The African Agricultural Technology Foundation, for example, is mandated to facilitate the transfer of technologies (including, but not limited to,

agbiotech) between research organizations in the public and private sectors (AATF 2009). In doing so, the African Agricultural Technology Foundation provides the expertise—individuals with significant experience in agricul- tural science, communications, legal affairs, and regulatory affairs—needed to design and negotiate formal agreements that address the risks associated with PPPs. But the findings indicate that this is not perceived as adequate protec- tion against risk for private firms.
Regardless of how skilled such organizations as the African Agricultural Technology Foundation are at mitigating risk through legal recourse, or how well a CGIAR center’s own legal capabilities are developed, they are still likely to be limited relative to those of the multinational firms with which they part- ner. Thus, several respondents to the 2006 IFPRI study argued the need to bolster legal expertise at the system- or center-level sufficiently for the CGIAR to confidentially navigate protracted litigation or negotiate with batteries of lawyers from the private sector. Most other respondents, however, thought that legal recourse offered little benefit to any of the parties to a partner-
ship, arguing that legal recourse would only lead to costly litigation and the loss of good faith among partners, thus harming project implementation and the long-term growth of PPPs. Moreover, many argued that legal recourse is difficult to pursue in developing countries, where legal and regulatory regimes are rarely equipped to address the complex issues underlying PPPs and tech- nology development. Ultimately, respondents indicated that well-planned and carefully executed projects were the only real defense against the risks associ- ated with ensuring good stewardship.
Policy Recommendations
Evidence from the two studies examined here indicate that even though pub- lic research in Africa is advancing in several countries, policies may be hin- dering the advancement of this research. Regulatory processes are holding up testing and commercialization, and institutional and organizational barriers to PPPs are inhibiting the application of private-sector resources and exper- tise that would provide valuable learning and information-exchange oppor- tunities. These findings suggest that existing policies are insufficient relative to the requirements needed to realize the benefits of these new technologi- cal opportunities.
There are several regional, national, and global policy options that could improve agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa. One is to enhance the quantity and quality of information on the environmental safety of GE crops

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 199
in confined testing or commercial use through information sharing among countries and researchers—such as information about the characteristics of transgenes, gene constructs, host plants, agroecological and agroclimatic zones, experimental designs and observations, and regulatory findings.6
An option is to place this information in an open-access venue, such as the Biosafety Clearing-House, so that environmental assessments of crops
or traits can be carried out based on accumulated experience among indus- trialized and developing countries.7 This approach presents opportunities
for South-South collaboration, information networking, and data sharing, with the objective of minimizing redundancies while maximizing the flow of information and expertise based on solid and comprehensive sources of infor- mation, ultimately increasing regulatory proficiency and minimizing R&amp;D costs. Greater knowledge of the array of available transgenes can also be used to strengthen the public sector’s position in negotiating access agreements over proprietary materials and techniques. In this context, there is also a need to build capacity in research organizations and train local researchers to make effective use of electronic biotechnology research databases and conduct advanced research.
Several innovative approaches to collaborative research could also improve the pace and level of research on agbiotech and GE crops. One possibility is for the public sector to take a stronger public negotiating stance, advocate for greater private tax incentives, or promote other mechanisms to improve the willingness of firms to invest in or provide intellectual property donations for research with a public-interest focus. Other arrangements may be formalized as commercial joint ventures, in which public and private collaborators estab- lish a legal entity to execute a public-interest research agenda and endow it with a mix of governance and management characteristics from the public and private sectors. Lessons can be learned from China, where several agbiotech ventures are advancing as commercial entities spun off from public research agencies, often wholly or majority owned by the parent agency.
Alternatively, researchers and policymakers may explore the use of “hon- est brokers” (nonprofit third-party organizations) to facilitate interactions
6 The Program for Biosafety Systems operates one granting program for research in these areas— the Biotechnology–Biodiversity Interface. Grants are awarded annually following peer review. See PBS (2009).
7 The Biosafety Clearing-House is a mechanism set up by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to facilitate the exchange of information on living modified organisms and assist parties to the Protocol in meeting their obligations under it. The Clearing House provides access to scien- tific, technical, environmental, legal, and capacity-building information in all six of the United Nations’ official languages. See BCH (2009).

between the sectors, manage the research, and assume responsibility for the use of proprietary knowledge and technology. The International Service
for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) and the African Agricultural Technology Foundation are playing such a role in agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa.
The advancement of agbiotech and GE crop research in Africa also requires greater investment in building systems and markets for seed and plant- ing materials. Enactment of plant variety rights and truth-in-labeling laws, combined with a greater commitment from public research organizations to moving technologies off the shelf and into farmers’ fields, would facilitate greater investment in GE research and product deployment in Africa. PPPs, technology commercialization programs, competitive grants, reward/prize programs, and other such approaches could go a long way toward shifting pub- lic research incentives toward more commercially viable outcomes.
Conclusions
Progress in agbiotech and GE crop research, development, and dissemination in Africa is constrained by insufficient investment in—and regulatory imped- iments to—the approval and release of new GE products. The two stud-
ies on agricultural research in developing countries examined in this chapter offer several critical findings about this progress. First, agbiotech and GE crop research is advancing slowly, although there are some signs that new crops, traits, and technologies are in the pipeline for Africa. Second, although some progress has been made in terms of introducing biosafety regulation in many African countries, movement through regulatory processes is inadequate rela- tive to the opportunities offered by the new technologies. Third, critical assets and competencies from the private sector are not being adequately brought
to bear on the research challenge and are not in close collaboration with pub- lic research.
These conclusions strongly suggest that efforts need to be redoubled to promote research, development, and dissemination of GE crops in Africa. For agbiotech to benefit Africa, greater efforts are needed to enhance the inter- national exchange of information on GE crops and to overcome institutional barriers to research collaboration between the public and private sectors. Such efforts would promote a more entrepreneurial culture of innovation and make public research institutions and private companies more responsive to emerg- ing needs and opportunities.

POLICY AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH 201
Success may depend on the emergence of a real breakthrough—the suc- cessful navigation through regulatory processes and deployment through commercial channels of a crop that can make a real difference to small-
scale, resource-poor farmers. Such a breakthrough could demonstrate the tech- nology’s potential to contribute to the region’s development, as well as the importance of the processes needed to make this contribution. However, if the impediments discussed in this chapter persist, the pace of research, develop- ment, and dissemination will be insufficient to generate such a breakthrough, thus slowing the diffusion of new technological opportunities and the poten- tial gains to social and economic welfare in Africa.

Genetically Modified Foods and Crops: Africa’s Choice
Robert Paarlberg
The future of genetically modified (GM) foods and crops in Africa will depend heavily on choices African governments make regarding the reg- ulation of this technology. There are two different regulatory approaches to choose between: the approach used by the European Union (EU) and
that used by the United States. There are four key differences between
these approaches:
• The regulatory approach used in Europe requires new and separate laws that are specific to GM foods and crops. In contrast, the United States regulates genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for food safety and environmental safety using the laws that were already in place to gov- ern non-GM foods and crops.
• The European approach also requires the creation of new institutions
(for example, national biosafety committees) and a separate screening
and approval process for GMOs. In the United States the institutions
that screen and approve GMOs (the Food and Drug Administration,
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Environmental Protection Agency) are the same institutions that screen and approve non- GM foods and crops.
• The European approach also differs because it can decline to approve a new technology on grounds of “uncertainty” alone, without any evidence of risk. A hypothetical risk that has not yet been tested for is sufficient reason for blockage. This is known as the precautionary approach. In the United States, if standard tests for known risks (such as toxicity, allergenicity, and digestibility) have been passed successfully, there is usually no regulatory barrier to commercial release.

• Finally, in Europe products in the marketplace with some GMO content must carry identifying labels, whereas in the United States the Food and Drug Administration does not require labels on any approved GM foods.
Which of these two approaches is better? In the abstract, the best regula-
tory approach is one that allows new technologies to be used while prevent- ing new risks to human health or the environment. Using this standard, the US approach has so far done a better job than the European approach, because it has allowed many more useful new technologies to be employed by farm- ers, fortunately without any documented new risks. In contrast, the European approach has blocked the planting of GM crops in most countries in Europe, and in many cases the consumption of GM foods and feeds, to the frustration of most European farmers, who want to share in the productivity gains these crops provide. Most of the GMOs that have been put on the market over the past dozen years have been approved using the risk-based American regulatory approach rather than the uncertainty-based European regulatory approach, and yet the safety record for the technology has remained essentially un- blemished. This could be seen as a strong recommendation for the American approach. If the European approach had been followed everywhere, many fewer productive technologies would have been available to farmers, and the safety record would not have been any better.
There has not yet been any documented evidence that approved GMOs have posed new risks either to human health or to the environment. This find- ing of “no new risks” is now the official view of scientific authorities in Europe itself. European science academies took a number of years to study the impacts of GM crops on human health and the environment following the first com- mercializations in 1995, but by 2001–04 a consensus had emerged, even in Europe, that no new risks from these seeds had been documented.
In 2001 the Research Directorate General of the EU released a summary of 81 separate scientific studies conducted over a 15-year period (all financed by the EU rather than private industry) aimed at determining whether GM products were unsafe, insufficiently tested, or underregulated (Kessler and Economidis 2001). The EU Research Directorate concluded from this study that “research on GM plants and derived products so far developed and mar- keted, following usual risk assessment procedures, has not shown any new risks on human health or the environment” (EU Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, press briefing, 2001).
National academies of science in Europe began drawing this same conclu- sion one year later. In December 2002, the French Academy of Sciences (2002,

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND CROPS: AFRICA’S CHOICE 209
p. xxxviii) stated that “all the criticisms against GMOs can be set aside based for the most part on strictly scientific criteria.” At the same time the French Academy of Medicine (2002) announced it had found no evidence of health problems in the countries where GMOs had been widely eaten for several years. In the UK in May 2003, the Royal Society presented to a government- sponsored review two submissions that found no credible evidence that GM foods were more harmful than non-GM foods, and the Vice-President and Biological Secretary of the Royal Society, Professor Patrick Bateson, expressed irritation at the undocumented assertions of risk that continued to come from anti-GMO advocates:
We conducted a major review of the evidence about GM plants and human health last year, and we have not seen any evidence since then that changes our original conclusions. If credible evidence does exist that GM foods are more harmful to people than non-GM foods, we should like to know why it has not been made public. [Paarlberg 2008]
In March 2004, the British Medical Association, which had earlier with- held judgment, endorsed these Royal Society conclusions (BMA 2004).
In September 2004 the Union of the German Academies of Science and Humanities produced a report that concluded, “according to present scientific knowledge it is most unlikely that the consumption of the well characterized transgenic DNA from approved GMO food harbors any recognizable health risk” (Helt 2004, 4). This report added that food from insect-resistant GM maize was probably healthier than from non-GM maize due to lower average levels of the fungal toxins that insect damage can cause.
A consensus also emerged at the global scientific level that no new risks
had been linked to any of the GM crops and foods to have reached the mar-
ket so far. In March 2000 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris organized a conference with 400 expert participants
from a variety of backgrounds. These experts announced their agreement that “no peer-reviewed scientific article has yet appeared which reports adverse effects on human health as a consequence of eating GM food” (OECD 2000, 2). In August 2002 the Director-General of the World Health Organization endorsed consumption of GM foods, saying, “[the World Health Organization] is not aware of scientifically documented cases in which the consumption of these foods has negative human health effects. These foods may therefore be eaten” (Mantell 2002).
Some accept that GM foods are probably safe to eat yet still question their safety for other living things in the biological environment (their “biosafety”).

210 CHAPTER 8
All farming disturbs and changes nature, so it is difficult to agree on exactly what level of disturbance can be considered acceptable. For example, plant-
ing a GM variety of beet or rapeseed can help farmers control weeds in the field (compared to conventional beet or rapeseed), and as a result there may be fewer insects in the farm field (using the weeds for food and shelter) and fewer weed seeds for some farmland birds to eat. Some might see this as a damaging disturbance of nature. Yet by most conventional definitions of biosafety, the GM crops currently on the market have not disturbed nature (beyond farm fields) any more than conventional crops do. A 2003 study conducted by sci- entists from New Zealand and the Netherlands published in The Plant Journal examined data collected worldwide up to that time, and the authors concluded from this data that the GM crops approved so far had been no more likely to worsen weed problems than are conventional crops, no more invasive or per- sistent, and no more likely to lead to gene transfer. There was no evidence that GM crops had transferred to other organisms (including weeds) new advan- tages, such as resistance to pests or diseases or tolerance to environmental stress (Connor, Glare, and Nap 2003).
Later in 2003 the International Council for Science examined the find- ings of roughly 50 different scientific studies that had been published in 2002–03 and concluded, “there is no evidence of any deleterious environ- mental effects having occurred from the trait/species combinations currently available” (International Council for Science 2003, 3). In May 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations issued a 106-page report summarizing evidence that “to date, no verifiable untoward toxic or nutri- tionally deleterious effects resulting from the consumption of foods derived from genetically modified foods have been discovered anywhere in the world” (FAO 2004). On the matter of environmental safety, this FAO report found the environmental effects of the GM crops approved so far—including
such effects as gene transfer to other crops and wild relatives, weediness, and unintended adverse effects on non-target species (such as butterflies)—had been similar to those that already existed from conventional agricultural
crops. Finally, in 2007 a study done for the journal Advances in Biochemical Engineering / Biotechnology surveyed 10 years of research published in peer- reviewed scientific journals, scientific books, reports from regions with extensive GM cultivation, and reports from international governmental orga- nizations and found that the data available so far provide no scientific evidence that the cultivation of the presently commercialized GM crops has caused environmental harm (Sanvido, Romeis, and Bigler 2007).

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND CROPS: AFRICA’S CHOICE 211
In 2010, the EU Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (2010, 16) produced yet another reassuring report on GMO safety:
The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than
130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.
Skeptics who remain fearful sometimes respond that “absence of evidence is not the same thing as evidence of absence.” Yet if you look for something for 15 years and fail to find it, that must surely be accepted as evidence of absence. It may not be proof that risks are absent, but proving something is absent (proving a negative) is known to be logically impossible.
The explanation for Europe’s highly precautionary regulatory approach toward GMOs goes beyond risks. It is a policy posture that reflects not a pres- ence of new risks for Europeans, but instead an absence, for most Europeans, of new benefits. The first generation of GM crops provided benefits to farm- ers, but almost no benefit at all to food consumers.
The first generation of GM crops that came to the market in 1995–96 pro- vided benefits mostly to farmers growing cotton, maize, and soybeans in the form of lower costs for the control of insects and weeds. Yet Europe does not have many cotton, maize, and soybean farmers, so the new technology had few champions. For the 99 percent of Europeans who were not maize, cotton, or soybean farmers, the new technology offered almost no direct benefit at
all. For consumers in Europe, the new GM products did not taste any better, look any better, smell any better, prepare any better, or deliver any improved nutrition. Because the vast majority of Europeans saw little or no direct ben- efit from the technology, they felt they had nothing to lose by keeping it out of farm fields and out of their food supply. They welcomed a highly precaution- ary regulatory approach as one way to ensure that outcome.
To demonstrate that it was a benefit calculation rather than a risk calcu- lation that mattered most to Europeans in this case, look at the quite differ- ent way Europe regulates GMOs in medicine versus GMOs in agriculture. In the case of medical drugs, Europe does not hesitate to permit the commercial sale of medicines developed with genetic engineering. By 2006 the European Medicines Agency had actually approved 87 recombinant drugs, derived from GM bacteria or from the ovary cells of GM Chinese hamsters. Significantly, these drugs were not free from new risks; it had been learned from clinical

212 CHAPTER 8
trials that many of these drugs actually increased risks of heart disease, malig- nancy, and gastric illness, but European regulators approved them just the same, because of the benefits the drugs could deliver to so many Europeans. While fewer than 1 percent of Europeans stood to benefit directly from GM agricultural crops, 100 percent were vulnerable to the diseases these GM drugs could help treat, so the regulator treatment of the GM drugs was far less pre- cautionary. There were both known risks from clinical trials and plenty of uncertainties surrounding long-term exposures, yet these risks and uncertain- ties were not allowed to block the commercial release of a technology that could bring significant benefits to Europeans.
Consider now the very different circumstances of Africa. In Africa, the per- centage of the population that might benefit directly from agricultural GMOs is much higher than in Europe, because 60 percent or more of all Africans are still farmers who depend directly on agriculture for income and subsistence. Some GM crop traits now widely commercialized outside of Africa, such as crops with the Bt gene inserted (for example, maize and cotton), which resist insect damage with fewer chemical sprays, could have wide benefits if planted in Africa today. Other GM traits soon to come out of the research pipeline, including abiotic stress tolerance traits, such as drought resistance, could pro- vide even wider benefits in the future.
Drought-tolerant maize is only one of the new GM crop technologies now emerging from the research pipeline. Maize is a staple food for more than 300 million people in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA), many of whom are themselves growers of maize. These Africans remain poor and food insecure because the productivity of their farming labor is so low. Population growth has been pushing maize production into marginal areas with little and un- reliable rainfall, and only 4 percent of cropland in SSA is irrigated. These fac- tors, combined with human-induced climate change, are expected to increase drought risks to maize growers in Africa in the years ahead. The development of maize varieties better able to tolerate drought is one important response to this growing challenge.
Not all drought-tolerant maize varieties are GMOs. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center’s Drought-Tolerant Maize for Africa initiative, funded in 2007 by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and
the Howard G. Buffet Foundation, is designed to accelerate the breeding
of non-GM drought-tolerant varieties of maize (both hybrids and open pol- linated varieties) in 13 countries in SSA. This initiative will use conventional and marker-assisted selection breeding but no transgenic techniques. A second initiative does use GM techniques. This is the Water-Efficient Maize for Africa

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND CROPS: AFRICA’S CHOICE 213
(WEMA) project, funded in 2008 by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and operated in Africa by the African Agricultural Technology Foundation. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center is a partner in this project, as is the Monsanto Company. This initiative will use transgenic tech- niques in addition to conventional and marker-assisted selection.
Regulatory requirements in Africa for GMOs emerge as a critical consid- eration here. WEMA’s GM varieties of drought-tolerant maize will deliver benefits to African farmers only if African regulators first allow the technol- ogy to be tested in open field trials in Africa and then approve the technology for commercial release to farmers. The regulatory gauntlet for this technology will be long and difficult because in Africa, just as in Europe, transgenic tech- nologies are screened using separate and much higher regulatory standards than are used for other technologies. In each separate African country, it will not be possible for technology developers such as the African Agricultural Technology Foundation to conduct research on a WEMA variety (for exam- ple, plant a field trial) without an explicit prior approval from a National Biosafety Committee (NBC). Giving or selling the seed to farmers will not be permitted in any country until the NBC has granted a formal commer- cial release.
Before they grant a commercial release, NBCs typically require that tech- nology developers submit a substantial dossier of data—including the molec- ular characterization of the variety, the results of lab tests for food safety, and the results of field trials for efficacy and biosafety. Once this data is in hand, the NBC can either grant a commercial release promptly; refuse to approve; ask for more data; or do nothing at all, in which case the technology can-
not be legally sold or distributed to farmers. So far, only two governments in SSA have ever given a commercial release to any GM crops: South Africa (for maize, soybean, and cotton) and Burkina Faso (only for cotton) ( James 2011).
Even if there are no arbitrary regulatory slowdowns or blockages, it will still require years for GM varieties of drought-tolerant tropical white maize
to make their way through this regulatory gauntlet in Africa. The first year of WEMA field trials of GM white maize hybrids was completed in 2009 at two sites in South Africa. These were subtropical varieties intended to be used by smallholders in South Africa and parts of Mozambique. Later in 2009 national biosafety regulators in both Kenya and Uganda followed South Africa and approved applications to begin confined field trials of WEMA maize, but reg- ulators in Tanzania did not. Moving beyond the confined field trial stage will be a challenge for Uganda, because the parliament there has not yet passed a national biosafety bill, a measure that GM critics insist is needed before a full

214 CHAPTER 8
environmental release of any GMO is permitted. In Kenya, moving beyond the confined field trial stage for WEMA maize will be difficult as well. Field trials of GM cotton have been underway in Kenya for years, yet as of 2011 approval for commercial planting had yet to be given. Meanwhile, not even confined field trials have been approved by Tanzania or Mozambique, so even if every- thing works perfectly for the technology, 2013 is now the earliest that field testing of the WEMA varieties can be undertaken in all five WEMA coun- tries, and it will not be until 2015, at the earliest, that WEMA’s GM drought- tolerant tropical white maize hybrids will have undergone enough efficacy testing, agronomic trials, biosafety testing, and variety development in these countries to generate the data needed to support an application to an NBC
for commercial release. Even at this point, there will be little guarantee of a prompt regulatory approval.
Why have so many governments in Africa chosen to follow this highly precautionary European approach toward regulating GM foods and
crops, despite the technology blockages and extended delays nearly cer- tain to result? Five separate channels of external influence on Africa have led to this choice of Europe’s regulatory approach over the approach of the United States.
Bilateral foreign assistance is the first channel of external influence on Africa. Governments in Africa are still significantly dependent on foreign assistance, on average, four times as aid-dependent relative to gross domestic product as the rest of the developing world. For this reason, much that takes place in Africa today remains donor driven. Because Africa’s official develop- ment assistance from Europe is three times as large as that from the United States, it is the voice of European donors in Africa that tends to be more domi- nant than any American voice. Governments in Europe have used their official development assistance to encourage African governments to draft and imple- ment European-style regulatory systems for agricultural GMOs.
A second channel of external influence has been multilateral technical assis- tance through the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) / Global Environment Facility (GEF) Global Project for Development of National Biosafety Frameworks. Of 23 African governments that had completed a National Biosafety Framework under this UNEP program by October 2006, all but South Africa and Zimbabwe had no previous regulations in place for agricultural GMOs, so UNEP was in effect writing on a blank slate. In the end, 21 of these 23 countries embraced the strongest possible approach (the “Level One” approach), requiring regulations through binding legal instru- ments approved by the legislative branch of government (parliament), parallel

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND CROPS: AFRICA’S CHOICE 215
to the European approach. Europe had greater influence than the United States over this UNEP/GEF program because European governments con- tribute roughly three times as much to the GEF trust fund as does the United States.
A third channel of external influence has been advocacy campaigns against GMOs from international nongovernmental organizations, the most active
of which are headquartered in Europe. Greenpeace International and Friends of the Earth International, both based in Amsterdam, have campaigned heav- ily in Africa against agricultural GMOs. Zambian officials were told by Greenpeace that if GMOs were let into their country, organic produce sales to Europe would collapse. An organization named Genetic Food Alert warned Zambia in 2002 of the “unknown and unassessed implications” of eating GM foods, and a British group named Farming and Livestock Concern warned them that GM corn could form a retrovirus similar to HIV. These assertions, which were not backed by any evidence, frightened the Zambians into banning GMOs completely.
A group of mostly European nongovernmental organizations contin-
ued this campaign against GMOs at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa. Led by Friends of the Earth International, they coached their African partners into signing an open let- ter warning that GMOs might cause allergies, chronic toxic effects, and can- cers. At this same meeting in 2002, two Dutch organizations, HIVOS and NOVIB, joined with partner groups from Belgium, Germany, and the UK
to finance a “small-farmers march” on Johannesburg (led by a non-farmer) that ended with a pronouncement that Africans “say NO to genetically modi- fied foods.”
A fourth channel of external influence has been commercial agricul- tural trade. Africa’s farm exports to Europe are six times as large as exports to the United States, so it is European consumer tastes and European reg- ulatory systems that Africans most often must adjust to. In 2000 private European buyers stopped importing beef from Namibia because it had been fed on GM maize from South Africa, and then in 2002 Zambia rejected GM maize as food aid in part because an export company (Agriflora) and the export-oriented Zambia National Farmers Union were anxious that exports of organic baby corn to Europe not be compromised. The risks of export rejections from African countries that plant GMOs are actually quite small, as evidenced by the continued growth of food sales to Europe from South Africa, yet anxieties surrounding export loss play a political role in setting policy.

216 CHAPTER 8
The final channel of external influence is cultural. Most policymaking elites in Africa have much closer cultural ties to Europe than to the United States, so they are naturally inclined to view European practices as the best practices. For example, the Kenyan author of a 2004 article (published
by the European-financed nongovernmental organization Participatory Ecological Land Use Management Association) that was titled “Twelve Reasons for Africa to Reject GM Crops,” later explained to a newspaper reporter, “Europe has more knowledge, education. So why are they refus- ing [GM foods]? That is the question everybody is asking” (Paarlberg 2008, 145). Policymaking elites in Africa have often been educated in Europe, they send their children to European schools, and they travel to Europe fre- quently both on official and unofficial business. It is not surprising that they would be inclined to adopt European-style regulations for GMOs, even though Africa’s needs and circumstances are so different from those
of Europe.
External influence of this kind is not unique to Africa, of course. In Latin America, within the sphere of influence of the United States, government poli- cies toward GM crops have usually been closer to the American approach than to the European approach. As of 2008, 7 out of the top 10 countries around the world with significant plantings of GMOs were located in the Western Hemisphere. It is also telling that the only Asian country to have approved GMO maize, the Philippines, is a former American colony.
In this case political leaders in Africa pay a price for simply “doing what Europeans do.” Europe has placed stifling regulations on GM foods and crops because Europe itself has little need for this new technology. European farmers are already highly productive without it, and European consumers are already well fed. Indeed, like consumers in the United States, Europeans are increas- ingly overfed. In Africa, where farmers are not yet productive and where so many consumers are not yet well fed, the potential gains that GM crops can provide are more costly to do without.
Rather than deferring to outsiders, either Europeans or Americans, Africans might usefully look for ways to make independent judgments of their own regarding how to regulate GM crops. Other countries in the develop-
ing world that still have large farming sectors and operate relatively free from external influence—such as the People’s Republic of China—have so far seen high value in this technology and have been investing significant public bud- get resources of their own to develop this technology, for their own distinct and independent benefit.

Conclusion
Guillaume Gruère, Idah Sithole-Niang, and José Falck-Zepeda
Although genetically modified (GM) crops have been adopted by farm- ers in an increasing number of countries, their use remains very lim- ited in African countries south of the Sahara. Only three countries
have approved GM crops for commercialization. South Africa first planted GM crops in 1997; Burkina Faso and Egypt just started using GM maize and cotton in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Other African countries south of the Sahara have implemented confined field trials of GM crops ( James 2011),
but so far none of these crops has reached farmers’ fields. Detractors have
used the observed limited adoption to support the allegation that GM crops are not—and will not be—useful for African countries south of the Sahara. Even though this argument is deceptively simplistic, it rightly reflects the wider questioning about the current and potential role GM crops and prod- ucts could play in the region in a changing global economic, demographic, and climatic environment.
This book offers a collection of economic and policy studies providing some elements of response to this particular question. Although there is still a significant gap in the literature on the economic effects of GM crops in those African countries south of the Sahara, especially compared to other regions, the selected contributions presented here aim to show that existing research can already bring forward useful lessons for stakeholders and policymakers in this area while pointing toward areas for further inquiries.
More specifically, as noted in the following two sections, we have identified five main lessons from the results of the contributed chapters that outline both the opportunities offered by GM crops and the multiple challenges ahead. Naturally, these conclusions are directly drawn from the individual studies with specific geographic scopes, topics, and methods that can present impor- tant caveats. But the following sections demonstrate that they are representa- tive of other publications on GM crops in those African countries south of the Sahara. Thus, despite the heterogeneous set of countries, crops, and methodol- ogies discussed, these lessons convey a message that so far is validated by avail- able research-based evidence.
 
220 CONCLUSION
Opportunities for African Farmers South of the Sahara
The first main lesson is that, based on available data and published studies, cur- rent GM crops have had on average a positive economic effect in African coun- tries south of the Sahara, but the magnitude and distribution of their potential economic benefits for farmers highly depend on the crop, trait, and especially the institutional setting in which the technology is introduced. An important cor- ollary to this finding is the need for ex ante technology assessment studies to go beyond simple cost–benefit analyses using average performance data and to address such issues as uncertainty, downside risk, and production practices and their limitations. This finding is consistent with the conclusions of Smale et al. (2009) based on an international review of published articles on GM crops in developing economies. It also concurs with the main conclusions of Tripp (2009) based on a compilation of case studies on the use of Bt (insect- resistant) cotton in different countries (including South Africa and others in Asia and Latin America) and with meta-analyses conducted by Finger et al. (2011) and Areal, Riesgo, and Rodriguez-Cerezo (2012).
In a review of the situation and of published economic studies, Gouse (Chapter 1) indicates that the adoption of Bt crops by smallholder farmers in South Africa appears to have resulted in positive agricultural and economic outcomes for a majority of adopters. GM crops in general have been exten- sively adopted there, with annual fluctuations. The South African example of Bt cotton also shows the importance of a proper institutional setting.
Pray et al. (Chapter 2) suggest that the adoption of Bt maize could reduce the exposure of poor farmers in South Africa to the mycotoxin fumonisin and therefore lower the risk of certain types of cancers. But a wider adoption of Bt maize by smallholder farmers in South Africa would not solve the problems of poverty and exposure, and the authors note that Bt maize would need to be adopted in challenging areas where farmers are not currently using GM or hybrid crops.
Two ex ante analyses in this book conclude that GM crops have a sig- nificant role to play in Uganda and thus potentially in other African coun- tries south of the Sahara. Horna et al. (Chapter 3) show that GM cotton has the potential to improve the productivity of cotton in Uganda. At the same time the authors conclude that it will not be a silver bullet for resolving the poor performance of cotton in the country, especially given the lack of ade- quate input. Even though their simulation results demonstrate that the high- est returns are associated with Bt and herbicide-tolerant cotton, they argue that these technologies will not increase the profitability of cotton very much,

as existing low productivity in the cotton sector is a binding factor limiting potential improvements from a damage-control technology such as Bt cotton. Institutional and regulatory issues will need to be addressed if these GM crops are to be successfully commercialized.
Kikulwe et al. (Chapter 4) analyze the case of GM bananas in Uganda using survey data. The authors estimate the annual opportunity cost of non- adoption of these crops as an average 38 US dollars (US$) per Ugandan house- hold. This means that, if the approval decision were made solely on the basis of economic benefits, GM bananas should be immediately released unless the average household is willing to pay US$38 per year to avoid its release, pro- duction, and consumption. Furthermore, Uganda loses a significant amount
of money by not adopting because of the potentially catastrophic damage that the fungal disease black Sigatoka causes on resource-poor farmers who do not have the resources for chemical control.
These results are in line with other economic evaluations of GM crops in other African countries south of the Sahara. Several ex ante simulation stud- ies on Bt cotton in West Africa have concluded that the region would ben- efit from releasing this technology and would lose from avoiding it (Vitale et al. 2007; Falck-Zepeda, Horna, and Smale 2008; Bouët and Gruère 2011). Burkina Faso has adopted GM cotton, but it is too early to quantify its full economic effect in the field, even if results from the field trials (Vitale et al. 2008) and first observations suggest a positive economic effect with yield increases and pesticide reduction (Fasozine 2009; Vitale et al. 2010). An ex ante study of GM vegetables, based on farmer surveys in Ghana, also showed that even if the results depend on the crop, GM vegetables are likely to be eco- nomically advantageous for farmers in Ghana (Horna et al. 2008). Several studies have also focused on Bt cowpeas, with converging evidence on the potential for using GM technologies to improve this widely used staple crop in West Africa (Langyintuo and Lowenberg-DeBoer 2006; Gbègbèlègbè et al. 2009).
Challenges Ahead
Various challenges have constrained the use of GM crop technologies. The studies presented in this book analyze some of the key issues that need to be addressed, from the development of adapted GM technologies to the setting up of regulations and the handling of regulatory burdens and trade and mar- ket acceptance.
CONCLUSION 221

222 CONCLUSION
The second main lesson is that there are insufficient efforts in public and pri- vate biotechnology development in Africa, and that one of the main constraints is related to the policy environment. Spielman and Zambrano (Chapter 7) argue that although public research is advancing, with promising technologies for the African context (such as drought-tolerant maize), policy environments may hinder progress in deploying such technologies. The authors find that the private sector is still left out of the research environment in agricultural bio- technology in Africa and note the need to promote research and development, increase exchanges of information, and promote a more entrepreneurial cul- ture of innovation.
The third lesson is that evolving biosafety regulations in countries south of the Sahara, which tend to determine the degree of deployment of GM crops in the region, appear to be based on a highly costly, European precautionary approach, despite clearly diverging agricultural and development priorities. Paarlberg (Chapter 8) demonstrates that external influence has a critical role in Africa’s choice of regulatory model. Yet the author argues that the European model does not correspond to African needs and realities for a number of reasons, and he concludes that African regulators will be better off by choosing their policies independently of others. Falck-Zepeda and Zambrano (Chapter 6) review biosafety regulatory costs for applicants, showing the high costs for selected East African projects. The authors argue that high regulatory costs can have serious consequences in African biotechnology development. They conclude that biosafety regulatory sys- tems need to balance risk avoidance with the cost of implementation and the potential (net) benefits that the technology may bring when adopted by farmers.
The fourth lesson is that the alleged short-term export risks due to potential market losses in Europe and other GM-averse countries may have been exagger- ated and need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and that the upcoming chal- lenges of market access and import regulations call for regional integration of GM trade regulations.
Wafula and Gruère (Chapter 5) discuss the potential export risks for southern and eastern African countries based on a review of results from the literature. Although each study the authors review presents intrinsic limita- tions, their findings indicate that commercial risk—and possible export loss to the EU—appear to be relatively small in the short and medium terms. Intraregional trade appears to be more important, and therefore regional agreements are critical to the future of GM crops in Africa. Their conclusions are nuanced by the fact that trade may change in the future.

Other trade analyses in the literature confirm these conclusions, but also note the cost of not adopting GE crops when competitors do. For instance, in the case of export risks, Anderson and Jackson (2005) show that the welfare loss with European market restrictions is small compared to the expected gains with GM crops in African countries south of the Sahara. The Langyintuo
and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2006) analysis of the West African regional market for cowpeas concludes that regional introduction of Bt cowpeas would be the best solution to prevent nonadopting countries in the region from losing eco- nomically. Similarly, at the global level, the delayed adoption of Bt cotton in West and Central Africa is found to have a significant cost, given the adoption of this technology by competitors (for example, see Elbehri and MacDonald 2004). More generally, Gruère, Bouët, and Mevel (2011) draw three lessons from the international trade literature on GM crops that do apply to African countries south of the Sahara: (1) GM crop adoption generates economic gains for adopting countries and importing nonadopters, (2) domestic regula- tions can reduce these gains, and (3) import regulations in other countries can also affect the gains of exporting adopters.
One aspect not discussed in this book is the design and implementation
of import regulations in African countries. Kagundu (2009) provides a first assessment of border-control challenges for GM products in Kenya. Kimani and Gruère (2010) discuss the proposed cost of case-by-case import approval and the possible implementation of documentation requirements under the Cartagena Protocol in the same country. Gruère and Sengupta (2010) men- tion the incomplete enforcement of border measures in southern Africa. More studies are needed in this area.
The last lesson is that the level of awareness of GM crops appears to be low among surveyed consumers. In addition, acknowledging this low awareness and the limitation it may confer on survey results, and the fact that only one study is included here, GM technology seems to be generally well accepted among sur- veyed consumers, but urban (especially high-income) consumers appear to have
a lower acceptance of GM food than do rural consumers. If confirmed, this low acceptance may create significant challenges on the road to commercializa- tion of potentially promising GM crops, especially foodcrops and those crops developed by public-sector research.
As mentioned earlier, Kikulwe et al. (Chapter 4) study the acceptance of GM bananas in Uganda. Among other things, the authors find that urban elites are more reluctant to buy GM products than are rural consum- ers. Thus, developers and national policymakers need to implement explicit robust outreach and communication efforts to address public concerns and

224 CONCLUSION
raise awareness in terms of the potential impact of the introduction of GM crop technologies.
There are a few other studies published on this topic for the region, and they confirm this result. Kimenju and De Groote (2008) analyzed GM
maize acceptance in Kenya and show that awareness of biotechnology is lim- ited in Kenya, especially in rural areas. All consumers are willing to buy GM maize at the same price as non-GM maize, even if there are some concerns. Environmental concerns are found only among urban consumers. In their study of Bt cowpeas in Benin, Niger, and Nigeria, Gbègbèlègbè et al. (2009) found that rural consumers, who tend to be farmers, would be willing to pay more for Bt cowpeas than for the non-GM varieties. In contrast, urban con- sumers are less willing to buy GM cowpeas. In South Africa, a study run by the Ministry of Science and Technology on consumers’ perceptions of biotechnol- ogy found that 75 percent of the respondents were uninformed about biotech- nology (Durham 2009).
A relevant side issue to the policy debate in African countries south of the Sahara in the literature is the possible potential disconnect between consumer perceptions and the local food industry, which may lead to conflicts between these groups, highlighting the need for improved knowledge-exchange chan- nels. Bett, Okuro Ouma, and de Groote (2010) clearly illustrate the latter point in their study of Kenyan gatekeepers’ perspectives, noting that these compa-
nies would benefit if they were informed about the results of consumer surveys. They also provide evidence of the disconnect between consumers and the local industry. Kenyan gatekeepers (millers and supermarkets) are found to be more skeptical than consumers are on the possible use of GM food. Most would pre- fer assessing GM food on a case-by-case basis before purchasing or selling these products. For some of the larger commercial actors, this perception may be related to the great reluctance of buyers abroad regarding the use of GM food. For instance, Gruère and Sengupta (2009) found that GM-free private standards set up by large importing companies in European and other developed countries do influence traders’ decisions and indirectly some policy decisions about bio- technology in eastern and southern African countries. Gruère and Takeshima (2012) provide an economic analysis explaining why importing companies can indeed affect views of decisionmakers in Africa.
Outlook for the Future
These conclusions confirm that GM crops have a significant role to play in agri- culture development in African countries south of the Sahara. But the nature

and modalities of this role will be defined largely by national and regional pol- icy choices as well as the institutional setting in which these technologies will
be deployed to farmers. Although there is evidence that several GM crops could be beneficial to smallholder farmers in Africa, on a case-by-case basis, there is also much work needed to improve the policy, research, and regulatory environ- ment to ensure that they can be a tool to help advance agricultural development. The research results collected in this book suggest that setting up a balanced and functioning regulatory framework is a critical and necessary determinant of the advancement of GM crops. Given current export and import issues, regulat- ing trade of GM products will require regional coordination if not a common framework. In parallel, governments should increase the awareness of farmers, consumers, and the food sector concerning GM crops.
A side result of this book is the call for additional research to be conducted in this area. More data and more rigorous analyses are needed to confirm or complement the lessons of these selected contributions. Only a few coun- tries and crops have been studied, and there are only a few consumer studies in the peer-reviewed published literature. But even focusing on the specific stud- ies presented in this book, there are still important limitations to the research methodologies. This is certainly not limited to studies in Africa (Smale et
al. 2009), but this point needs to be emphasized. Each conclusion naturally stands on the robustness of the arguments, data, and methods used in each particular study.
Other issues that have not been specifically addressed in this book require a lot more research. First, the role of intellectual property rights in facilitating or constraining adoption will continue to be part of the discussions. Second, the acceptance and impacts of GM crops on women farmers, given their impor- tance in African farming and agricultural development, is another priority area for future research. A few projects are ongoing in Africa, but more will need to be done, especially as new GM technologies advance toward commer- cialization. Third, the potential environmental benefits and costs associated with GM technologies in Africa and other regions is still an underinvestigated topic. Although GM crops are often associated with potentially negative envi- ronmental externalities, there is increasing evidence that some of them may also have positive environmental externalities (for example, the effect of Bt crop adoption on water quality or non-target organisms, and broader protec- tion of biodiversity by increasing agricultural productivity). Last, more analy- ses of the political economic rationale driving different countries’ positions for or against GM crop introduction are needed to understand some of the above- listed challenges.
CONCLUSION 225

226 CONCLUSION
What is the outlook for the future? The development or testing of cur- rent and new GM crops and the strengthening of regulatory capacity in several African countries suggest that GM crops will play a growing role in the agricul- ture of African countries south of the Sahara. But their impact on smallholder farmers is uncertain and will depend on the issues outlined in this book.
Clearly, next-generation GM crops—such as those tolerant to drought, resistant to pest and diseases, and with improved nutritional quality—could address other more specific productivity constraints that African farmers face every day. Other examples include crops with increased efficiency in the use of macronutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorus. Furthermore, they could con- tribute to managing risk and address the expected increase in climate change variability. They would thus support African communities’ resiliency and improve the livelihoods of resource-poor farmers.
But this potential can only be made possible through robust and consistent investments in technology and the support of the institutional setting where these technologies will be released to farmers. The driving force for these tech- nologies to advance lies in the hands of national policymakers and their will- ingness to pursue these opportunities. But the capacity, expertise, and support of external institutions will also continue to play major roles. In particular, new players like China and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation acting as donors and technology providers, and such regional bodies as the African Union and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, can be expected to
play a critical role in determining the future of these agricultural technologies. Given the evidence presented here, undertaking these challenges proactively appears to be the best approach for the future.

 AVARIABLE CLIMATE, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS HAVE limited agricultural development in African countries south of the Sahara. Genetically modified (GM) crops are one tool for enhancing agricultural productivity and food security despite such constraints. Genetically Modified Crops in Africa: Economic and Policy Lessons from Countries South of the Sahara investigates how this tool might be effectively used by evaluating the benefits, costs, and risks for African countries of adopting GM crops. The authors gather together studies on GM crops’ economic effects and impact on trade, how consumers view such crops, and other issues. They find that GM crops have had, on average, a positive economic effect in the nations where they were used and identify future steps for enhancing GM crop adoption’s positive effects. Promising policy initiatives include making biosafety regulations that do not make GM crop development prohibitively expensive, fostering intraregional trade in GM crops, and providing more and better information about GM crops to consumers who might currently be skeptical of them. These and other findings in Genetically Modified Crops in Africa indicate ways biotechnology can contribute to economic development in Africa south of the Sahara.

abstract
While the Green Revolution has been successful in some regions like South and East Asia, it could hardly address any achievement in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This paper tries to draw a picture on lessons learned from the failures of this revolution that should be taken into account before implementing the so-called Gene Revolution in the SSA region. After scrutinizing the failures and the pros and cons of GM crops in the region, the paper introduces some potentials for improving the malnutrition situation in SSA through launching a successful GM technology. However, it remains doubtful whether this technology can improve the situation of small-scale farmers as long as they receive no financial support from their national governments. Therefore, before any intervention, the socio-economic and environmental impacts of GM technology need to be carefully addressed in the framework of a series of risk assessment studies. Besides, some sort of multi- stakeholder dialog (from small-scale farmers to consumers) involving public–private sector and non- governmental organizations should be heated up at both national and regional levels with regard to the myths and truths of this technology.

 1. Introduction
This paper discusses the consequences of genetic modified (GM) crops in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared with the Green Revolution. It is a critical issue because while the Green Revolution brought much success in some regions like South and East Asia, it could never work out in the SSA region (Mugabe, 2003). At the moment, this is an important topic due to the fact that still millions of hungers live in this region and deal with poverty. According to the FAO (2009), in 2005, 213.8 millions of poor were identified as undernourished in SSA. Moreover, more than

600 million people live on small farms measuring no more than a few hectares each in this region where low productivity due to biotic and abiotic factors is responsible for food insufficiency and malnutrition (Olembo, 2005; 173). It seems that without a new revolution in the agricultural sector, their living standards might be worsened. A couple of important questions could be asked here: why did not the Green Revolution work out in SSA? And what can be learned from this revolution to launch a successful and new revolution called ‘Gene Revolution’ in this region?
More precisely, the paper tries to answer to the following questions: Why was not the Green Revolution successful in SSA? Can the Gene Revolution result in an improvement on the malnutrition in the region? What can be learned from the failure of the Green Revolution in SSA to
 
benefit from a successful GM technology approach? What are the main advantages of GM crops compared with non-GM's in SSA? What threats are involved when implementing GM technology in the region?
2. Green Revolution
2.1. Successor
In 1798, Thomas Malthus published his first Essay on the Principle of Population. He believed “the populations of the world would increase in geometric proportions while the food resources available would increase only in arithmetic proportions”. Malthus rejected that technological progress might deal with the growing population (Weeks, 2005). When the industrial revolution emerged, the food production passed the population growth. However, despite the increased food production since 150 years ago, there are still enormous undernourishment problems. The problems prompted the Rockefeller Foundation, in the 1940s, to gather and fund a team of specialists in order to develop agricultural innovations for developing countries (Wu and Butz, 2004). The team developed some new seeds which were superior to other indigenous species in terms of increasing the yield, yield stability, resistant to diseases and insects and grain quality. Along the seeds, they also introduced a package of other innovations including new fertilizers, irrigation systems, and pesticides (Perkins, 1990). According to Wu and Butz (2004), a new version of Green Revolution is now emerging as so-called ‘Gene Revolution’. The supporters of the Gene Revolution argue that this revolution can create resistant plants to certain diseases and water shortages, and even capable to improve soil texture. On the contrary, the opponents believe the new revolution may bring unexpected and irreversible effects to human health and environment (Knox and Marston, 2007).
2.2. Success and failure
During the Green Revolution, the improved high yield varieties (HYVs) resulted in a tremendous increase in food production worldwide. They accounted for almost 90 and 70% of the increased world's foods, respectively at the end of the 1960s and 1970s (Knox and Marston, 2007). The Green Revolution was especially an obvious success in Asia and Latin America where the regions could almost eliminate the undernourishment. However, the revolution did not have the desired results everywhere. It did not have its intended effects in SSA and even at the moment, the results in most of the African countries are limited. While the new technologies were performing well in laboratories, they were not successful in the field. The researchers ignored the local conditions of these countries (Wu and Butz, 2004). The scientists had also not taken into account the fact that many of the existing crops have several secondary uses like fuel, provision of hay, building materials and fodder. The new developed crops did not provide the farmers such secondary functions, which discouraged them from employing the new technologies (Smirzai, 2005). Instead, the revolution has led to a monoculture by cultivating a minimum variety of some cereals like maize, wheat, and rice (Thompson, 2007).
Also, the low population density in the SSA region hampered the application of new seeds, fertilizers and pesticides in order to intensify agriculture (Smirzai, 2005). When rapid population growth occurred in those countries which have low population density, the farmers continued using extensive methods of agriculture because there was still uncultivated land available. They were not forced by land scarcity to apply new techniques and therefore the farmers did not make the transition to intensification of agriculture. On the one hand, the rapid population growth, and on the other, extensive agricultural practices (Smirzai, 2005) resulted in a futile circle as the practices could result in agricultural land conversion (Azadi et al., 2010) and lower agricultural output.
The application of fertilizers was another important factor in order to let the new varieties become more productive (Otsuka and Kalirajan,
2006). However, because of the high fertilizer costs and low output prices, the Sub-Saharan African peasants were discouraged from using the fertilizers. As a result, the soil fertility tended to deplete and the outputs seemed to decrease. Otsuka and Kalirajan (2006) argue that the high fertilizers' costs weakened the peasants' bargaining power at market level. Furthermore, the prices increased because of the transportation system in SSA that was not well developed. Wu and Butz (2004) discuss, because of undeveloped transportation systems, it was difficult to put modern technologies timely in places where needed. Besides fertilizers, chemical pesticides were also required. Obviously, over time, pesticides and fertilizers could cause soil degradation and water pollution. In sum, the following reasons can be considered for the failures of the Green Revolution in SSA:
▪ While implementing new agricultural techniques, the hidden functions of conventional crops were neglected by researchers;
▪ Low population density and abundance of uncultivated land did
not force farmers to apply new techniques. Such drivers let farmers
continue their extensive agricultural practices.
▪ The high fertilizers' costs and low output prices concerned
peasants about implementing the new techniques;
▪ An undeveloped transportation system hampered a fair distribu-
tion of the modern technologies among the farmers;
▪ The risk to human health and environmental pollution due to the use of fertilizers and pesticides, discouraged the farmers from
going for the new varieties.
3. Toward the Gene Revolution: lessons learned from the Green Revolution
There are a lot of similarities between the two revolutions. The Green Revolution increased food production that was very vital for developing countries because of their serious food deficiency. At the moment, the Gene Revolution has the potential to increase food production as well (Wu and Butz, 2004). The technology of both the revolutions focuses on plant attributes and they both concentrate on the global markets and capture subsistence farming. Because of such similarities, the following issues should carefully be addressed in the framework of a series of risk assessment case studies before welcoming the GM technology.
First, the costs and charges of GM technology should be addressed. At the moment, such technologies are being supported by major oligopoly capitalist firms like Monsanto, Pioneer Hybrid, Syngenta, and Dupont which are playing the important role of disseminating GM seeds throughout the world. GM products may be licensed by the patent holders and therefore, those farmers who grow GM crops might become dependent on buying their seeds from those, relatively few suppliers (Morse, 2008) while the seeds have to be bought every year because farmers cannot reproduce them by themselves. Furthermore, according to (McMichael, 2009a: 252), at a time when flexible seed selection by African farmers has managed recurring drought, gene patents threaten farmer sovereignty, and shift resources away from farmer-based strategies for climate change survival and adaptation.
At present, many SSA farmers are unable to compete with the relatively lower prices that many especially North American food producers are able to sell rice, wheat, corn and soybeans for and the consequence has been a ruination of many SSA farmers who wind up flooding the major cities of Africa. More importantly, “small-scale farmers” cannot easily afford such new expensive seeds each year. Just like the HYVs, GM seeds are a large expenditure for such farmers in SSA (Wu and Butz, 2004).
There are also concerns about possible dumping (i.e. setting the pricing of a product below its cost of production) of GM crops by the firms or nations in an effort to dispose of surplus stocks or to recoup money spent on costly transgenic research and development (Azadi et al., 2011). In 2003, for instance, the United States had 65 million tons of surplus non-GM wheat and rice in its Food Cooperation stocks.

Paradoxically, just a year before, the US sent India a large shipment of food aid with genetically modified ingredients, which India rejected (Friends of the Earth International, 2003). The US has also dumped subsidized rice in Haiti, forcing thousands of poor rice farmers off the land (Kamau, 2002). Dumping food on to poorer nations (i.e. free, subsidized, or cheap food, below market prices) undercuts local farmers, who cannot compete and are driven out of jobs and into poverty, further slanting the market share of the larger producers such as those from the US and Europe (Shah, 2005).
Accordingly, the States has been accused of dumping some GM crops, especially into francophone parts of Africa, in part because Europe does not accept it. This might even undercut local producers accelerating the rural to urban shift. The concern has also been that single seed companies may gain a monopoly over the seed supply market. If this happens, prices could be increased all the way up to the consumer because of increased seed prices.
Also, the risk of widening the gap between large and small-scale farmers should be addressed. Rich farmers might be able to adopt GM crops earlier and faster than the poor farmers (Smirzai, 2005). Accordingly, if GM crops become available in SSA, they will be more available to wealthier farmers who can afford such technological innovations (Azadi et al., 2011). Therefore, a first lesson learned might be to give the poor farmers easier access to credits (e.g.) by subsidies and low interest loans. However, others allege a biotechnological bias toward larger farms, because the society can have some earlier benefits through them (Azadi and Ho, 2010). As a result, it may solve the problem of per capita food insecurity in SSA countries.
Second, the dissemination of biotechnology knowledge among the SSA region remains poor. Even though the undeveloped infrastructure (roads, communication systems) hamper the spreading of biotech- nological knowledge, GM producers should strive for spreading GM crops throughout the whole SSA region, instead of limiting the access to biotechnologies to a small number of (large-scale) farmers. For instance, in Asia, the first Green Revolution varieties became regional public goods, in the sense that varieties were diffused in the country where they were being developed, as well as in neighboring regions (Otsuka and Kalirajan, 2006). If there is no openness in the production methods of GM crops in different sub-regions of SSA, chances to generate the Gene “Revolution” are not high. Hence, a more favorable environment for implementing GM technology in SSA may arise when the relatively few suppliers of GM seeds, agricultural research centers, large, and small-scale farmers establish longstanding relationships in order to exchange knowledge about a feasible implementation of GM crops. However, as long as the knowledge of biotechnology is privatized by the use of patent rights and a monopoly of a few GM seed suppliers, such a favorable environment cannot be created.
Third, the investments in infrastructures (e.g. transport systems, communication systems) have to be made to attain more access to markets and to create an encouraging environment to disseminate the biotechnology knowledge among participating stakeholders. Without necessary improvements in infrastructures, the Gene Revolution may experience the same failures as its predecessor.
Carruthers et al. (2010) discuss when infrastructure is absent or degraded, it no longer fulfills its connective functions, and the economy suffers. Although investments in infrastructure have currently contributed more than half to Africa's improved economic growth, still much more needs to be made (Prasad, 2011). According to IFC (2010), in recent years, investments in the SSA's infrastructures have averaged about $10 billion per year, equivalent to just three percent of the region's gross domestic product and only approxi- mately half of what is needed to support sustained economic growth.
The African leaders of the New Partnership for Africa's Develop- ment (NEPAD) have clearly indicated that among their priorities are infrastructure and agriculture; the two have an interface. To launch a widespread agricultural development program (like the Gene Revolution), NEPAD discusses the necessity of major transport
corridors for product processing and marketing (FAO, 2002), especially, if products are expected to be presented beyond local markets (Azadi et al., 2011). As a response to this problem, national governments together with international donors could primarily focus on improving existing major corridors and constructing roads between farms and markets to increase the linkage between producers and consumers (MIT, 2011).
Fourth and final is that despite an increase in food production, there are a lot of political, socio-economic and bio-physical interplays that should also be considered. For example, McMichael (2009a,b) draws a historical picture on geo-political drivers in the framework of global ecology and a “food regime analysis”. He presents a macro analysis to explain the strategic role of major previous agricultural programs (like the Green Revolution) in the construction of the world capitalist economy (McMichael, 2009b). He further discusses (McMi- chael, 2009a) that the global development project faces newly evident challenges in the combination of energy, climate and food crises which are realized more critical in SSA and can affect major new food policies (like the Gene Revolution) in favor of capitalist economy resulting more in marginalizing poor farmers (Saini, 1976; Wu and Butz, 2004), and biodiversity loss (Goodland, 1997; Trewavas, 2001). As a result, if such incidental circumstances are not taken into account, it will be difficult to launch a successful Gene Revolution.
4. Application of GM crops in Sub-Saharan Africa
4.1. Potential gains
There are some potential gains when implementing GM crops in SSA. First and most importantly, those farmers who use GM crops might gain higher yields that could provide the basis to lessen the undernourished (Smirzai, 2005). At the moment, SSA is dependent on wheat and rice imports to acquire sufficient food for its population. Between 1995 and 2001, rice consumption increased by 5.3%, while the production rate grew by 2% (FAO, 2008). To meet the high demands, the rice imports increased annually by 8.4% so that SSA now accounts for 20% of the total world rice imports. If GM rice is implemented more extensively throughout SSA, this rice can be adapted to the specific environmental circumstances in the region, and as a result, dependency on imports can decrease. However, policy makers need to bear in mind the importance of food distribution. This view has been theorized by Drèze and Sen's (1990) entitled approach in which they elucidate that starvation is not necessarily caused by an overall shortage of food. Not everybody has the same capacities, capabilities, and connections to get access to food. Hence, if yields increase due to the application of GM seeds, it does not necessarily mean that undernourishment will decrease. It is also important to understand how the farmers sell and distribute their products.
Second, with regard to plant improvement, according to Morse (2008), GM crops are more targeted than conventional crops. For GM crop breeding, it is not necessary to handle millions of genes but only a few (Morse, 2008). Some other potential gains of the implementation of GM crops in SSA are presented by Thomson's (2007) study on some practical examples of the implementation of insect resistant maize varieties, drought tolerant, and virus resistant crops. The advantages presented include maize genes that can be modified to specific situations, as in this case, they were modified to become more resistant to viruses, insects, and also to the African dry weather. Furthermore, the small-scale farmers in SSA can use such insect resistant varieties to protect their crops against fungal infections which are originated mostly from the moist and warm storages of the crops in this region.
Third is the possibility to provide a tolerance to herbicides. This means that a farmer can spread herbicide on his/her field in order to eliminate undesirable plants except those which carry the tolerant gene (Wu and Butz, 2004). For consumers, GM crops can have some

indirect advantages too. When farmers adopt GM crops, the costs of cultivating such crops might decrease due to less chemical inputs, because of the pest resistance of some GM crops with transgenic pesticides (Azadi and Ho, 2010). As a result, food prices could decrease, so the possibilities for the SSA's poor people to be fed may increase. Furthermore, there are some developments with crop enrichment by adjusting nutritional elements. Perhaps, the most famous enrichment is used for ‘golden rice’. The rice contains some extra vitamin A which can protect people from blindness (Anderson and Jackson, 2005). As, according to Mason et al. (2001), 30 to 40% of preschool children in SSA suffer from vitamin A deficiency (VAD), the attachment of specific nutrients by GM technologies might partly be beneficiary to solve the deficiency of micronutrients in this region.
4.2. Potential losses
Critics argue that there are several limitations when using GM crops in SSA. First, opponents fear that GM crops can cause a loss in the genetic diversity of SSA, because the farmers will rely on producing a fixed set of GM crops. Consequently, without genetic diversity, the risk of epidemics will increase (Smirzai, 2005). Moreover, a loss in genetic diversity can exacerbate soil degradation that tends to be more deteriorated due to the loss of micro-organisms which naturally replenish the soil nutrients. Van Straaten (2002) argues that the African soil productivity has steadily declined in the last two decades due to the high depletion rate of the soil. Without maintaining a fertile soil, the success rate for the Sub-Saharan African farmers to produce sufficient and safe food will not be high. However, there are some signs that GM crops could potentially be a way of enriching soil texture since crops engineered are prospered not only to face drought, disease, and pests, but also to offer greater biomass post harvest. Due to the huge fertility issues affecting so much of Africa's latosol soils, more immediate advantage may accrue to SSA by simply breaking up and spreading the crushed remains of rocks that are badly needed minerals contained in those rocks like phosphorus.
Second, critics fear a potential risk for gene transfer from one GM to other non-GM crops. According to Altieri (2005), it is self-evident that modified genes can move beyond the intended destinations and easily contaminate other proximate non-GM crops. This cross-pollination/ contamination may cause serious problems for the non-GM crop growers since GM traits in cash crops, specifically for export markets in Europe are unacceptable (Anderson and Jackson, 2005). The EU is not allowing GM crops for human use, because according to the union, it may endanger human health. The EU's politicians want to make sure that they import totally GM free products. This means that if Sub- Saharan African countries need to open a market in the EU, they may not deal with GM crops. However, Anderson and Jackson (2005), after executing the scenario simulation model GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project), suppose that SSA gains more welfare by allowing GM production in their countries instead of banning such products in order to attain a greater access to the EU market. Also Paarlberg (2006) argues that the risks of commercial export for Africa are realistic but low. After analyzing the data of more than 12 African countries, he claims that the contribution of GM products to the total farm exports is not significant while only a small share of these GM products may go to sensitive GM markets such as the EU's.
Third, also related to the risk of cross-contamination, is the possibility of evolving ‘super weeds’. Transgenes might escape from GM crops to wild species and create the so-called super weeds, which are resistant to herbicides (Morse, 2008). It might result in useless implementation of costly herbicides which are often too expensive for the poor farmers in SSA.
Fourth, the last important constraint is that GM technology might not reach the poor farmers due to the property and rights of the technologies (Azadi and Ho, 2010). In line with this constraint, Amalu (2003) has also stated that profits of new advanced crops will
probably benefit large rather than small-scale farmers who have usually less access to financial resources and awareness toward technological advances. The adoption and adaption of GM technology by the Sub-Saharan African farmers might also be constrained by high illiteracy rates that result in difficulties to disperse knowledge and awareness among the farmers to employ the technology.
5. Discussion and conclusion
Although the global food crisis during 2007–2008 was sunk into oblivion by the emergence of the financial and economic crisis, the need for feeding the ever increasing population can never be ignored. Whereas SSA includes a large part of the growing world population, the access and availability to sufficient nourishment still remains very scarce in the region. While GM crops have been introduced in South Africa, Malawi and a few other southern SSA countries, their introduction has been sporadic and they might be no panacea for solving food insecurity. To better understand the possible gains and losses of GM crops in SSA, it is imperative to take into account the failures of the Green Revolution in the SSA region. After scrutinizing the failures and also the pros and cons of GM crops in this region, this paper considers some potentials for improving the malnutrition situation in SSA through launching a successful Gene Revolution.
Drought tolerant GM crops could be beneficiary for this region where chronic and acute droughts often occur. The big GM crop companies (Monsanto and Pioneer Hybrid, Syngenta, and DuPont) have already developed crops with drought tolerance traits. Accord- ingly, the Sub-Sahara African farmers can therefore rest assured of a safe-net harvest when facing drought (Paarlberg, 2006). However, without financial support from the African states, the small-scale farmers will not be able to afford such an expensive technology. For example, in Ethiopia more than 90% of the agricultural outputs are produced by subsistence farmers (Azadi et al., 2011). If they cannot get access to the aforementioned drought tolerant crops, the implementation of GM crops will not have a significant impact on the region. Furthermore, biotechnology allows also for breeding the varieties which are enriched by micronutrients such as vitamin A, zinc, and iron. Crops enriched with micronutrients can be provided to the malnourished people in SSA who often have to deal with an unbalanced diet (von Braun, 2010). In addition, GM crops have a lower demand for herbicides and pesticides which can result in less cost for the farmers and positive environmental impacts.
In conclusion, despite the potential advantages of GM technology in SSA, it remains doubtful whether it can positively affect the situation of small-scale farmers as long as they receive no financial support from their national governments. Moreover, the local socio-economic and environ- mental impacts of GM crops need to be considered. When GM crops contaminate non-GM's, conventional breeders face the risk of diminish- ing exports. Hence, the effects of implementing GM technologies in SSA on their export markets should critically be assessed before launching any Gene Revolution as a solution for malnutrition in SSA. Also the environmental impacts should carefully be addressed. In order to be fully aware of the positive and negative impacts of GM technology in SSA, von Braun (2010) recommends an increase of investments in R&amp;D and a strengthening of partnerships to exchange biotechnology knowledge between organizations at different scales (global, national, regional, and local).
In addition, it should be noted that given some important contextual differences, existing GM researches will not necessarily be transportable to SSA. The main contextual differences include possible dissimilarities in the roots of food insecurity and malnutrition in the region, the nature of health concerns, the prominence of agriculture, and diverse food regulation systems (Mugabe, 2003; Pelletier, 2005). This may imply that the potential benefits as well as the potential risks of biotechnological innovation may have dispro- portionate impacts in the SSA context that should explicitly be

addressed. For instance, corn and soybeans that are glyphosate resistant in North American must locally be tested through many parts of SSA before their seeds are sold directly to farmers. Such adaptability researches must study the biosafety and environmental risk assessment concerns that have been raised around the world in response to GM crops before these crops can safely be promoted. Overall, all the impacts of using this technology should carefully be assessed in the framework of a series of risk assessment studies on the bases of both “crop-case” and “region-case”.
The risk assessment studies should address the possible trade-offs; most importantly, biosafety regulatory frameworks, the role of multi- national companies and other stakeholders in the application of biotechnology with respect to biosafety issues (Ushewokunze-Obatolu, 2005), regulatory policies that warrant the right of poor farmers and consumers (Pelletier, 2005), the role of intellectual property right (Olembo, 2005), and the gains and losses of stakeholders (Matz and Ferenz, 2005).
Lastly, some sort of multi-stakeholder dialog involving public– private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should be heated up at both national and regional levels. Some people within Africa especially believe that implementing GM technology goes against nature and God. Others claim huge productivity benefits with minimal negative environmental consequences of implementing this technology. Hence, the academic disputes on the potential of GM technology need to be widened to a broader public debate in which all stakeholders (from small-scale farmers to consumers) can get informed about all the myths and truths of this technology.

GMOS AND ORGANIC AGRICULTURE: SIX LESSONS FROM AUSTRALIA
SUMMARY
GMO moratoria are in place in Australia, in some states and not in others. Is co-existence possible between organic farming and GMO farming? And if so, under what circumstances? Australia has more certified organic land than any other country, with a reported 12.0 million hectares of certified organic land compared to the world total of 37.5 million hectares. In a recent court case, an organic farmer lost his organic certification because of GMO contamination. A total of 325 hectares of his 478 hectare farm were contaminated with GM canola blown from a neighbouring property, and this resulted in the decertification of most of the farm. The organic farmer sued his neighbour, a GMO farmer, on the basis of nuisance or negligence, he sought damages for loss of income, and he sought an injunction to rein in his neighbour‟s future GMO farming practices. The case ran before the Supreme Court of Western Australia over three weeks and it generated more than 1000 pages of transcript. The case was dismissed in its entirety, in a 150 page judgment, and is now subject to an appeal. This paper examines the judgment, in the light of the trial transcript of this landmark case, with the view to determining the implications for the future of organic farming and GMO farming, and in particular to ascertain what lessons can be learned from this litigation.
Keywords: Genetically Modified Organisms, Canola, Contamination, Organic Farming, Australia.
INTRODUCTION
Australia leads the world in terms of agricultural land certified as organic, and it accounts for nearly a third of the world‟s certified organic agricultural land (Willer &amp; Lernoud, 2014). Organic agriculture is globally important as a method of “sustainable and environmentally friendly production” (Cukur &amp; Celik, 2014) and it has evolved to exclude genetically modified organisms (GMOs) from its production systems (Paull, 2014a).
In Australia, the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) “must assess and license a GM [genetically modified] crop before it can be grown commercially in Australia” (DAFF, 2008). Current commercial-release approvals

are limited to only GM varieties of cotton and canola (OGTR, 2014). The Regulator must be “satisfied that any risks can be managed to protect the health and safety of people and the environment” (DAFF, 2008).
Australian states and territories have some prerogative in allowing or disallowing GMO crops and, with the exceptions of Queensland and Northern Territory, all states and territories have imposed some level of moratorium on the planting of GMO crops (DoA, 2008). Tasmania and South Australia maintain robust moratoria against GMOs, while Victoria, New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australia (WA) allow GM canola.
According to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry: “Growers planting GM canola are required by the technology provider to undertake stewardship training to enable the co-existence of GM and non-GM canola” (DAFF, 2008). Of concerns about the coexistence of GMO agriculture with the organic sector: “ABARE found that GM canola production will have little if any effect on the organic sector” (DAFF, 2008).
In 2003, WA passed the Genetically Modified Crops Free Areas Act 2003 (Calcutt, 2009). In 2008, WA exempted GM cotton in the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) from the moratorium (WADAF, 2010). In January 2010, WA exempted GM canola from the moratorium despite that “since the advent of GM canola in Canada farmers can no longer grow organic canola in Western Canada” (WADAF, 2010) and declared that “common law allows for effective remedies for persons incurring damage from GM crops” (p.3).
Stephen Marsh and Michael Baxter have adjacent farms (Eagle Rest of 478 hectares and Sevenoaks of 700 hectares, respectively) in the Kojonup region of WA, about 256 km south east of the state capital city of Perth. Marsh‟s farm is certified organic by the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture, Australia (NASAA). His neighbour, Baxter, farms chemically and took advice of an agronomist employed by Farmanco, a rural advisory company (Martin, 2014).
Shortly after the moratorium was lifted for GM canola in WA, Farmanco Facts stated that: “The health, safety and environmental risks of adopting GM crops have been dealt with by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator ... Production and economic risks of adopting the GMO lies with the producer” (Pritchard &amp; Trezise, 2010). Adopters of Monsanto‟s GM canola were to “Complete a Technology User Agreement (TUA) including PRAMOG (paddock risk assessment and management option guide)”. The TUA requires “a minimum five metre (5m) separation between GM and non-GM crops”. The transfer of GM material into a neighbour‟s field was anticipated by Farmanco in that initial advisory: “Where your GM crop is on a boundary fence you will need to discuss management options for this scenario and also for the possibility of strong winds moving swaths into your own and your neighbour‟s paddocks” (Pritchard &amp; Trezise, 2010).
In that first year of legalisation in WA, Baxter planted out his paddocks adjacent to Marsh with Monsanto‟s Roundup Ready canola which was genetically engineered to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate (marketed by
 
GMOs and Organic Agriculture: Six Lessons from Australia

Monsanto as Roundup) using genes from bacteria. Marsh had previously alerted Baxter to his concerns that GMO contamination from Baxter‟s GMO crop may put his organic certification in jeopardy (Martin, 2014).
In late November and early December 2010 Marsh discovered GM canola swathes (Paull, 2014b) in some of his paddocks to a distance of 1.2 km into his farm; this was reported to his organic certifier and subsequently most of his farm was decertified (Martin, 2014).
Marsh sued his neighbour claiming common law negligence or private nuisance, he sought damages for loss of income, and an injunction to curtail his neighbour‟s GMO farming practices. The case was heard over the three weeks of 10-28 February 2014 and the judgment was delivered on 28 May 2014. The case was dismissed in its entirety. Organic certification was reinstated over the Marsh farm in October 2013. This case is the most expensive mounted to date by the organics sector, and this paper examines what lessons may be learned from it.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The Marsh v. Baxter case generated a substantial corpus of paperwork including the trial bundle (over 3000 pages), the trial transcript (over 1000 pages), and the judgment (150 pages). There was a general consensus about the facts of the case and the present paper draws particularly on the judgment to reveal what lessons can be drawn from the case. The present account is informed by a site visit to the Kojonup region and the road forming the common boundary of the Marsh and Baxter farms, by personal attendance for some days of the trial, and by informal encounters with the parties and their legal representatives at the Supreme Court of WA.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Contamination
The judge wrote of “the airborne incursion of approximately 245 GM canola swathes, which I have found were blown into some Eagle Rest paddocks from Sevenoaks in late November or early December 2010”. Marsh described this as GMO “contamination” of his farm and so did his organic certifier. The media of various persuasions also characterised this event as “contamination” (e.g. Crothers, 2014; Hamlyn &amp; Trigger, 2014; Jones, 2011; Peckham, 2014) although Forbes proclaimed “„No Such Thing As GMO Contamination‟ Rules Australian Court in Landmark Decision, Rebuffing Organic Activists” (Entine, 2014).
While finding that the Marsh organic farm had been peppered with GM canola from Baxter‟s farm, the judge however did not accept that this amounted to “contamination”. He wrote of “the late November/early December 2010 airborne incursion of GM canola swathes into Eagle Rest (described by the Marshes in their pleadings and submissions in tendentious fashion as a 'contamination')” (Martin, 2014). The judge declared that: “Much of the difficulty ... (... for Mr Marsh) seemed to stem from the fact that the term
 
10 John Paull
'contamination' is not defined in the National Standards or in the NASAA standards” (Martin, 2014).
Marsh v. Baxter failed to get to first base in convincing the judge that there had been a „contamination‟ of the organic farm, and this was likely fatal for a determination of either negligence or nuisance. There being an agreed “incursion” but not an agreed “contamination” the judge suggested that Marsh should take the matter up with his certifier (and outside of the present action) (Martin, 2014).
Lesson 1: Agree the terms underpinning an action, or produce substantiated definitions.
Mitigation
The judge commented unfavorably on the fact that the offending GM canola swathes arrived at Eagle Rest from November 2010 but were not removed until April 2011. There is a general principle in law that an injured party ought to act in a timely manner to mitigate the loss incurred from a harm.
The Judgment states that: “Surprisingly, it appears to have taken Mr Marsh until April 2011 to gather up and remove all the swathes and their (attached) canola seed pods. The gathered swathes then filled two drums ... But between late November 2010 to April 2011, the swathes just appear to have been left in situ, whilst photographed, plotted and even fenced off. Surprisingly, nothing timeous happened about getting rid of them, so as to inhibit any wider dispersal of canola seeds from their shattered seed pods across Eagle Rest's paddocks. In this period the 245 swathes appear to have been rather afforded the status of infamous celebrities ... and then made the subject of media releases ... Asked in cross-examination why it took so long to gather up and remove the canola swathes, Mr Marsh, I thought, gave a very unconvincing response for the inertia. He said that he had been „too busy‟ ... Part of what supposedly occupied his time appears to have been issuing media statements in liaison with NASAA. That is hardly an acceptable explanation. If there was a serious incursion problem of GM material at Eagle Rest to be dealt with, as Mr Marsh evidently felt there was, clearly it ought to have been addressed immediately, as a matter of high priority, rather than the swathes just being left to blow around in the paddocks of Eagle Rest for a period of about five months” (Martin, 2014).
Lesson 2: Mitigate losses as a priority and be seen to do so rather than to publicise them.
Dispute resolution
Invoking the apparatus of the law to resolve a business dispute - a civil matter - is wisely regarded as an action of last resort, for at least three reasons: (a) the cost; (b) the locus of control is shifted to a third party; and (c) the law is an adversarial process which produces win/lose outcomes. The outcome is somewhat

11
unpredictable and is outside of the control of the parties. In contrast, dispute resolution via negotiation or mediation offers the potential of a win/win outcome, and win/win outcomes are the raison d'être and the everyday currency of business. Tradeoffs are made until a transaction materialises where, for example, for the trader the cash is more valued than the goods and for the purchaser the goods are more valued than the cash.
In Marsh v. Baxter the amount raised by the plaintiffs for the action is stated to be AU$750,000 (c.€535,000) (Kinnear, 2014) whereas in contrast “$85,000 [c.€60,000] is the agreed figure for the net loss ... arising by reason of the absence of NASAA certification ... for approximately 70% of the area of the Eagle Rest farm - assuming that liability at this trial is ultimately established against Mr Baxter. That agreed sum has been derived as losses claimed across three successive financial years up to 30 June 2013, by the Marsh farming partnership” (Martin, 2014).
The judge comments on the lack of proportionality between the loss claimed and the potential cost of the recovery: “the $85,000 damages claimed is, in the context of the costs of Supreme Court litigation these days, a demonstrably uneconomic amount of money to be litigating over” (Martin, 2014).
Lesson 3: If the principle is more important than the money then „go for it‟, otherwise consider the proportionality between the known loss versus the unknown cost of the recovery along with the uncertain surety of any recovery.
Injunction
Given the obvious discrepancy between the damages sought and the cost of mounting an action in the Supreme Court the judge observed that “For the present action, a perpetual injunction is the significant remedy that is claimed against Mr Baxter” (Martin, 2014). “Injunctions are orders given by a court requiring a party to refrain from performing an action” (Saligari, 2013).
The injunction sought was a cornerstone of the case, it was the significant remedy claimed, and, that being the case, one might expect that the terms of the sought injunction would be clearly stated. Despite such an expectation, the terms of the sought injunction were in a continuous state of flux right up to “the last breath” of the trial (Martin, 2014).
Originally sought was a permanent injunction against the planting of GM canola within 2 km of the Marsh farm. In the course of the trial this proposed injuncted distance fluctuated until finally being relinquished entirely as was any injuncted planting of GM canola. The various iterations of the „strong‟ anti-GMO injunction eventually evaporated to be substituted with a „weak‟ anti-GMO injunction that only sought to restrain the method of harvesting (swathing) and only in paddocks adjacent to the Marsh farm. It was a muddled retreat, and even a victory (had there been one) would in these final terms have delivered only an eviscerated shadow of the original.
The judgment relates: “The linear dimensions of the area of permanent
 
12 John Paull
restraint as sought ... had shrunk considerably in the period prior to trial ... the plaintiff ... sought permanent restraints against planting GM canola against Mr Baxter on the cascading descent basis of within 2 km, alternatively 1.5 km, alternatively 1.1 km of Eagle Rest. A permanent restraint was also sought against swathing on an unlimited basis but, in the alternative ... it was sought that Mr Baxter be permanently restrained from swathing GM canola ... on the same alternative descending basis ranging between 2 km to 1.1 km” (Martin, 2014). There was no empirical substantiation: “in this trial the plaintiffs led no expert evidence concerning any underlying empirical basis for buffer zone restraints at any distance from Eagle Rest” (Martin, 2014).
The judge comments on the indeterminacy and vacillation of the plaintiffs: “Fluctuations by the plaintiffs over buffer zone distances, as regards inhibiting swathing on Sevenoaks carry ... a revealing insight for ... what was, or was not, reasonable conduct by Mr Baxter in November 2010 as regards his swathing ... More than three years after the 2010 incident, the plaintiffs plainly struggle to identify and to set down any fixed linear buffer distance. They finally reach a point where in the last breath of trial they seek a permanent injunction against swathing of GM canola in the (eastern) boundary paddocks of Sevenoaks.” (Martin, 2014).
The judge delivered his coup de grace: “In circumstances where a court is asked to exercise a discretion to grant permanent injunctive relief, the absence of an empirical basis to support any buffer distance sought (in perpetuity) is a negative consideration of some moment” (Martin, 2014).
Lesson 4: When seeking to limit other‟s actions have well substantiated reasons.
Novelty
Despite the fact that Baxter‟s own agronomic advisory company, Farmanco, had alerted farmers in their Farmanco News to the risk of GM canola swaths blowing onto neighboring properties (Pritchard &amp; Trezise, 2010) the judge saw novelty as an excuse for Baxter.
The judgment states: “Given that growing novelty for GM canola in WA, there was necessarily a certain amount of initial learning associated with the first planting, nurturing and then harvesting such a GM canola crop. Although Mr Baxter had grown canola crops for approximately 10 years before 2010, he had never harvested any of these crops by swathing ... it should be fairly recognised that there was something of an unknown position ... as the first commercial GM canola crops were planted, then harvested by farmers” (Martin, 2014).
Novelty ultimately trumped negligence in the judge‟s determination: “the common law duty of care as contended for by the Marshes ... is conceptually misconceived and cannot be made out. This is for many reasons. Not the least is, in a wholly novel case, the absence of a duty of care to avoid a foreseeable economic loss” (Martin, 2014).
 
GMOs and Organic Agriculture: Six Lessons from Australia Lesson 5: Novelty may support a defence against negligence.
Nuisance
13
 The events precipitating this court case were a nuisance to Marsh in any common usage of the word. However “there is a difference between what is annoying and what is legally classed as a „nuisance‟ ... Private nuisance ... is essentially a dispute between two individuals ... It is enough to show that you have been affected by some act or omission of another person. The effect must be that your enjoyment and use of your land has been interfered with ... you must show that the nuisance complained of is not trivial or unreasonable ... Examples of interference that have been found to be private nuisances include: noisy animals, loud air-conditioners, smoke, overhanging tree branches, tree roots growing into neighbours' land and interfering with drainage, vibrations and dust” (Saligari, 2013).
The judge quoted Pullin that: “Nuisance is a cause of action directed at the harm caused ... proof of nuisance does not involve a failure to exercise reasonable care” (Martin, 2014). The judge observed that a determination of nuisance is about balancing “the right of Mr Baxter to commercially utilise his rural land against the rights of his neighbours, Mr and Mrs Marsh, not to be unreasonably interfered with in their enjoyment and use of Eagle Rest” (Martin, 2014). He found that “there was no unreasonable interference with the Marshes' enjoyment of Eagle Rest” (Martin, 2014). He argued that: “there was no physical damage from the 245 swathes to persons, animals, land or chattels at Eagle Rest. The character of the damage contended for by the Marshes is purely financial, arising out of a private contractual relationship the Marshes voluntarily entered into with ... an organic status certifying organisation” (Martin, 2014). So despite the low hurdles to jump to establish nuisance, in this case they were not low enough.
Lesson 6: Nuisance may be in the eye of the beholder.
CONCLUSIONS
This case has provided no assurance that organic farming and GMO farming can happily coexist under the current legal framework. The organic farmer in the case has regained his organic certification after a three year decertification, but there is no constraint on GM farmers to contain their crops within their boundaries, and no recognition in the case that GM crops are a source of contamination for organic farmers. As for the decertification, the judge suggested that the plaintiff take it up with his certifier and seek relief in that direction, rather than from the farmer of the errant GM canola. There was no recognition of the special interests of organic farmers, and a rejection of the notion that wind-blown GM canola plants landing on an organic farm are in any way „contamination‟, nor that the neighbour‟s actions that led to the „incursion‟ of the GM plants are either a matter of private nuisance or of common law

negligence. The matter is subject to an appeal and so there is a faint hope that some or all of the judgment may be reversed.

Crop Case Study: GMO Golden Rice in Asia with Enhanced Vitamin A Benefits for Consumers

Golden Rice is genetically modified to provide beta-carotene in the rice grain and it could potentially address widespread Vita- min A deficiency in poor countries where rice is a staple. Politi- cal opponents have viewed Golden Rice as representing the interests of multi-nationals and as inherently unsafe for con- sumption. Progress has been made towards adapting this crop to tropical-rice growing environments, but it has not yet been introduced into farmer’s fields. Efficacy and safety have not yet been fully tested. Substantial work remains to target and deliver this intervention to Vitamin A-deficient populations, and to over- come remaining resistance to this technology. The political response to the on-going development of Golden Rice is reviewed to draw lessons for biofortification efforts that employ modern biotechnology. Within Asian countries, successful development and delivery will require policy dialogue among agriculturalists, health specialists, and advocates for the poor.
Key words: rice, biotechnology, Vitamin A deficiency.
A. In low-income populations where rice is the primary staple, several micronutrient deficiencies are chronic problems, including lack of Vitamin A. Such deficien- cies are particularly pronounced in small children, who need greater nutrient density in food to meet their higher nutrient needs. While the link between VAD and blind- ness captures public attention, VAD also lowers immune response and increases the death rate from common childhood diseases in developing countries, and as such VAD is often considered primarily in terms of child- hood-mortality effects.
VAD is widely recognized as a globally significant problem. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (2004, p. 4) estimates that “Vitamin A defi- ciency is compromising the immune systems of approx- imately 40% of the developing world’s under-fives and leading to the early deaths of an estimated one million young children each year.” VAD is often a problem where rice gruel is used as a weaning food. It is most important in the poorest nations of the world, including most of South and Southeast Asia where rice is the main staple, and that situation has not changed during the past decade.
The idea of using rice as a vehicle to address micro- nutrient deficiencies dates at least to the early 1980s. This idea emerged within the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) system and led to conventional breeding efforts to increase iron and zinc in rice in the 1990s. Creating rice with beta- carotene content was not possible until the advent of
 Introduction
Genetically modified rice that contains beta-carotene, widely known as Golden Rice (GR), has not yet been introduced in any country. It was developed to address Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in low-income rice con- sumers, but currently needs much more development and testing before it can be introduced into farmers’ fields. GR is the most famous biofortification effort undertaken with modern biotechnology, due to the ini- tial publicity (e.g., the cover of Time magazine on July 31, 2000). As such, it has been a lightening rod for the debate about the use of GMOs in meeting nutritional needs. Thus, for this special issue on GM foods and bio- fortification, a review of the lessons learned from the GR case is crucial to understanding the political land- scape for other biofortification efforts. GR shows both the dramatic nutritional benefits that can be achieved with use of modern biotechnology and the considerable hurdles to eventual adoption and impact.
Below, this article presents the story of GR, includ- ing a review of the controversies regarding its develop- ment and the literature estimating ex-ante benefits, risks, and costs. The article closes with an assessment of the current prospects for GR and lessons for other bio- fortification efforts.
Impetus, Development, and Initial Reactions
The polished rice grain does not contain beta-carotene, a Vitamin A precursor that the body converts into Vitamin

modern biotechnology techniques. The Rockefeller Foundation (RF) funded the initial GR research through its Rice Biotechnology Network, which was specifically established to address the need for basic biotechnology research on this important food crop that was likely to be ignored by the private sector in industrialized coun- tries. With support from the RF in the 1990s, Ingko Pot- rykus at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer at the University of Freiburg, Germany, col- laborated to introduce daffodil genes into rice. The sci- ence was complex and cutting edge at that time, as it was an early example of the use of pathway engineering. Their success was hailed as a significant breakthrough in the application of modern biotechnology, and the work appeared in Science (Ye et al., 2000).
In conjunction with scientific publication, Potrykus appeared on the cover of Time (July 31, 2000). Interest- ingly, the cover itself posed the debate that has dogged this idea from the beginning: “This rice could save a million kids a year, but protesters believe such geneti- cally modified foods are bad for us and our planet.” The article appeared at the height of the relatively new debate about the acceptance of GM foods, largely trig- gered by trade conflicts between exporting countries that had adopted the technology (the United States, Can- ada, and Argentina) and the importing countries (largely the European Union [EU] and other European nations).
Part of the publicity focused on the donation of intel- lectual property (IP) rights for the GR technology so that it could be further developed and adapted for intro- duction in the developing world. Apart from the patent held by Potrykus, several enabling technologies were also needed for further development. Potrykus formed a partnership with Zeneca (which later became Syngenta Seeds AS after its merger with Novartis), due to their history of work in carotenoids. Syngenta negotiated to put together a package of rights to be donated for humanitarian use, including patents held by Bayer AG, Monsanto Co., Orynova BV, and Zeneca Mogen BV. The condition for use of these patents include a) that seeds are developed for distribution to farmers in devel- oping countries earning less than $10,000 per year from farming and 2) that release only takes place in countries with adequate biosafety regulations. The donation of this package of IP rights for humanitarian purposes was advertised as a model for the future transfer of this tech- nology to developing countries.
Negative reactions to GR were immediate and in many cases quite emotional. The groups reacting included environmental advocacy groups already engaged in arguing against GM crops in general, as well
AgBioForum, 10(3), 2007 | 155
as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) engaged in nutrition and food-security issues in developing coun- tries. In Southeast Asia, such groups included Biodiver- sity and Community Rights Action (BIOTHAI) in Thailand, the Cambodian Center for Study and Devel- opment in Agriculture (CEDAC), the Development Research Communication and Services Centre (DRCSC) in India, GRAIN-MASIPAG (Farmer-Scien- tist Partnership for Development, Inc.) in the Philip- pines, and PAN-Indonesia and Policy Research for Development Alternatives (UBINIG) in Bangladesh (BIOTHAI et al., 2001). First-world opposition includes organizations opposed to GM technology, such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and Food First, as well as various groups in Europe (e.g., Institute for Sci- ence in Society in the United Kingdom). Nutrition inter- vention groups do not seem to have been as vocal in the debate.
Many of these reactions reworked long-standing concerns about Green Revolution technologies and the commercialization of smallholder agriculture and thus were not specific to GR. All of the opposing groups agree that VAD is an important problem but objected to GR either as an inappropriate or an ineffective solution. To summarize, the negative reactions were based on these points:
1. Malnutrition is a result of poverty and interventions already exist to address micronutrient deficiencies. Instead of developing GR, resources should be focused on poverty alleviation, sustainable farming, and proven strategies for nutrition intervention, such as supplementation and diet diversification through backyard or community gardens.
2. GM foods are inherently unsafe to human health and the environment. GR poses risks of these kinds and thus will not achieve its humanitarian goals.
3. Rice is directly consumed by the poor, and thus the poor would be “guinea pigs” for any human health impacts. Either GR will not provide enough Vita- min A to do any good or will provide too much, resulting in Vitamin A toxicity.
4. The IP arrangements are so convoluted that they do not preclude commercial abuse and do not represent a useful replicable model. The idea of “donation” is an anathema to those who object to commercial control of any agricultural IP.
5. GR is part of the continued use of “Green Revolu- tion” technologies that are unsustainable and harm- ful to the poor.
Dawe &amp; Unnevehr — Crop Case Study: GMO Golden Rice in Asia With Enhanced Vitamin A Benefits for Consumers

It is not this case study’s purpose to debate these points but rather to delineate issues that are under debate.
The virulence of the debate is surprising to someone who is agnostic on the subject. On the one hand, scien- tists, multi-national seed companies, and the CGIAR felt that they deserved credit for addressing a humanitar- ian issue head-on and for donating technology for bene- ficial use. Admittedly, multi-nationals were in need of positive publicity following the negative reactions to first-generation GM crops in Europe, and this was a strong motivation for their action on IP issues. But it does seem that scientists involved were surprised to have their motives questioned, as they genuinely believed in the positive humanitarian potential of this technology. On the other hand, those opposed to GM technology for ethical, environmental, or health con- cerns seem to have felt that this represented a commer- cial conspiracy to win over the public. They wanted to debunk this technology because it diverts attention from potential negative impacts to potential positive ones, thus changing the terms of the debate. They labeled it a “Trojan horse” for other biotechnology products in less- developed countries. For the NGOs involved in poverty alleviation, it represents competition for resources and influence. Thus, the debate has been quite hostile in that each side accuses the other of acting in bad faith.
Subsequent Evolution and Current Status
The public attention to this potential new technology reinforced for its advocates the need to address several issues in its development. It is perhaps unfortunate that the first scientific breakthrough generated so much attention when it remained fairly far removed from implementation. The initial strains of GR utilizing daf- fodil genes did not contain very much beta-carotene and might have had little impact on VAD in most Asian diets. This point was noted almost immediately by astute advocates for the opposition (e.g., Shiva, 2000). Later GR1 lines contain as much as 5 times more beta- carotene, although Dawe, Robertson, and Unnevehr (2002) found that even this level may not have much impact in some populations that are severely affected by VAD and for whom rice is not the only staple.
Subsequent research has utilized cereal genes rather than daffodil genes to generate much higher levels of beta-carotene in so-called GR2 lines (Paine et al., 2005). In these lines, the enzymatic activity in the PSY genes found within maize or rice is utilized to produce much higher levels of beta-carotene in the rice grain. The new levels of beta-carotene in GR2 lines are 20 times higher
AgBioForum, 10(3), 2007 | 156
than the original line, and these materials could provide all of the Vitamin A requirements for children eating rice-based diets (Stein, Sachdev, &amp; Qaim, 2006). This improvement in beta-carotene content brought forth a few restatements of the same general objections from those originally opposed to the technology (e.g., see Greenpeace, 2005).
The initial framework to donate GR technology for humanitarian purposes remains under the control of Pot- rykus and Beyer, who are advised by a Golden Rice Humanitarian Board (Golden Rice Humanitarian Project website). This Board does not make funding decisions. Much of the current funding for development comes from USAID grants to the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), as well as country-mission grants to National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS). Other funding sources include the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foun- dation, the Swiss Development and Collaboration Agency, the Syngenta Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.1 Research collaborators include IRRI, as well as NARS institutions in Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines, India, China, and Indonesia.
Field trials of the GR1 lines were conducted for the first time in 2004 at Louisiana State University (as US regulations allowed this step to move forward more quickly than in any Asian country). The first trials dem- onstrate that the crop is agronomically sound and may have higher beta-carotene when grown under field con- ditions. Limited field trials for the GR2 lines have also been carried out, but these GR1 and GR2 lines need to be crossed into appropriate indica varieties for use in Asia.
In Asia, research samples of the initial GR arrived at IRRI in 2001. Attempts were made to create new trans- genic variants of IR64, BR29, and other widely grown varieties in Asia with high levels of beta-carotene, using the same genes for beta-carotene synthesis. Breeding work (back-crossing) into leading Asian varieties was also undertaken with the initial GR lines. With the avail- ability of the new GR1 and GR2 lines with higher beta- carotene content, the activities with the initial lines were ended in 2003, and back-crossing work with the new lines began in 2004. As of yet, no field trials have been conducted in Asia, although such trials of backcrossed GR1 and GR2 lines may be conducted in the Philippines
1. Rockefeller has shifted almost all of its agricultural develop- ment funding to Africa and currently has only some funding that is partly for GR in Vietnam, the Philippines, and China. These are legacy grants from earlier investments in the Rice Biotechnology Network.

in 2007 and are possible in India in 2008 (G. Barry, per- sonal communication, June 20, 2007). These countries have relatively well established biosafety guidelines, and have already approved other GM crops for commer- cial purposes.
Beyond issues of agronomic viability, there are other development efforts required to address issues of accep- tance, safety, and impact. Some taste tests have been carried out (Dubock, 2005), although not yet in Asia. Bioavailability testing is currently ongoing at Tufts Uni- versity, using GR2 lines (Stein, Sachdev, &amp; Qaim, 2007), and the next phase will be a study in Asia (G. Toenniessen, personal communication, August 1, 2006). Detailed work for biosafety risk assessment will con- tinue as the crop-development work advances. This risk assessment work will be mostly carried out in Asia by NARS and will take several years to complete.
Preliminary stability and retention studies are also underway in Germany, the United States, and the Philip- pines in order to take account of varying storage and cooking conditions in different socioeconomic and cul- tural settings. For example, exposure to air, light, and moisture during storage will vary across locations. As another example, rice is parboiled in Bangladesh before eating. Conditions and food preparation processes such as these could have large effects on the quantity of beta- carotene in the cooked grain, so the results of these stud- ies will be critical for making a better assessment of the potential contribution of GR to alleviating VAD. More work of this kind will need to be done as more material adapted to local conditions is developed.
An Ex-Ante Analysis of Benefits, Costs, and Risks
As discussed above, the importance of VAD is widely recognized. Its persistence is testimony to the limita- tions of current interventions (discussed more fully in other papers in this special issue). GR has the potential to reach important subpopulations that have not been targeted by current interventions, most notably small children in parts of rural Asia where rice is the predomi- nant staple and weaning food. Several different studies have now tried to assess the potential benefits of GR using different economic methods and building their analyses on some strong assumptions about nutritional benefits. Because GR is still so far from actual produc- tion and consumption, little is known about bioavailabil- ity, losses in storage or cooking, or many other factors that would influence the actual delivery of Vitamin A.
AgBioForum, 10(3), 2007 | 157
These studies are beginning and will help define the deployment options for the product.
Costs of development will include basic research, adaptation to local conditions, biosafety testing, and costs of consumer and producer education, as well as any specific marketing regulations and future mainte- nance breeding. In 2002, Dawe et al. made very crude estimates of GR costs for Asia, which now appear to have underestimated the costs of development and pro- motion. Stein’s (2006) estimates of the costs for bring- ing GR to market in India are $21-28 million total for the next 30 years (discounted to the present), or $0.7-0.9 million annually. This includes costs of development within India of $4.1-8.7 million, $2.2-2.5 million for regulatory review, and $15.6-30.7 million for promotion and marketing. These estimates show that significant investments must still be made to bring GR to farmers’ fields in Asia, above and beyond international research and development (R&amp;D) to support understanding of bioavailability and biosafety.
Every ex-ante study has shown benefits from GR, and these are usually substantial and cost-effective. Dawe et al. (2002) found that the initial GR strain would deliver very modest amounts of Vitamin A in the diets of VAD children in one area of the Philippines. They also estimated that the initial GR was very cost-effective compared with other interventions, such as wheat forti- fication or supplementation. Zimmermann and Qaim (2004) estimated the benefits in terms of saved disabil- ity-adjusted life years (DALYs), and found potential reductions in annual health-related costs of $16-88 mil- lion in the Philippines. Anderson, Jackson, and Nielsen (2004) used their results to estimate benefits of better health for unskilled workers in a general equilibrium framework and found that health benefits potentially dwarf any agricultural productivity benefits from GM rice, maize, and oilseed crops in Asia.
The most recent study is by Stein (2006) for India, and it finds that the newer GR would reduce the burden of VAD in India by 5-54%, depending upon assump- tions about adoption and who consumes it. The cost-per- DALY-saved would be $3.40-35.47 for GR, which com- pares favorably with alternative interventions. However, these costs-per-DALY-saved for GR are significantly higher than equivalent costs for biofortification of rice or wheat with either iron or zinc. The latter biofortifica- tions are easier to achieve and to promote, as they involve less complex breeding applications and fewer consumer-acceptance issues. The Stein (2006) study confirms that major benefits are possible from GR, but also that it may be a more challenging biofortification
Dawe &amp; Unnevehr — Crop Case Study: GMO Golden Rice in Asia With Enhanced Vitamin A Benefits for Consumers

application than other potential biofortification interven- tions.
What are the risks for supporters of GR? One risk that seems minimal at this stage is that NGOs will be able to derail field testing on a large scale. Several coun- tries in Asia (including the Philippines and India) have already approved GM crops for commercial purposes, and there are procedures for such approval in many countries. If the data support the effectiveness and safety of the new crops, it seems politically likely that field testing will proceed. However, exporting countries like Thailand and Vietnam are cautious about GM con- tent that might reduce export prospects. GR at least pro- vides a visible marker (golden color) that would facilitate market segmentation.
However, NGOs may have more influence on adop- tion by farmers and consumers than on field testing. Many large NGOs are likely to support GR if it is safe and effective, e.g., the influential NGOs in Bangladesh such as Grameen, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), and Proshika. These NGOs are unlikely to take a major lead in promoting GR, but they will probably not oppose it and may lend some support to its dissemination if there is strong evidence it will help the poor. But many other NGOs advocate organic farming, and it seems unlikely that any amount of evi- dence will convince them to support GR: their objec- tions are due to ethical or ideological considerations, not scientific skepticism. Their influence is not to be ignored, and if GR is to be adopted, educational cam- paigns targeted to farmers and the general public will be of crucial importance.
There are several other risks that could be important. First, after substantial investment, GR may not be widely adopted and will have little semblance of the impact envisioned. Farmers who wish to sell it in mar- kets (most rice in Asia is traded in markets, not con- sumed at home) may not want to take the risks of adopting a new variety (e.g., lower yield, susceptibility to pests and diseases) unless they are compensated with higher prices or yields. However, such higher prices would work against its incorporation into the diets of the poor, possibly causing it to wind up as a niche product for rich consumers. One possibility to counter these incentives would be to bundle the increased beta-caro- tene content with other new desirable traits that farmers find helpful. Alternatively, GR could be grown by poor farmers for their own consumption, although again they may be discouraged by the risks noted above. Further- more, this strategy would limit the potential impact of GR because the poorest of the poor typically buy much
AgBioForum, 10(3), 2007 | 158
of their rice on markets. Yet another possibility would be for governments to subsidize the production and/or consumption of GR through public distribution systems to encourage adoption by farmers and consumption by poor consumers. However, it should be noted that tar- geted government subsidies in agriculture and food are difficult to deliver without substantial leakage of finan- cial resources.
Second, GR may cause unforeseen health risks, par- ticularly if it is the first GMO to be widely consumed by children. This speaks to the importance of extensive testing to ensure that GR has limited side effects and, after storage and cooking, has enough bioavailable beta- carotene to substantially reduce VAD. The lengthy approval process still underway for commercialization of Bt rice in China shows the concerns that governments have over GM food crops (as opposed to Bt maize intended for animal feed or Bt cotton). These issues are discussed more fully in the China and Philippines case studies elsewhere in this special issue. If Bt rice is approved in China, this will most likely smooth the path for approval of GR—certainly in China and possibly in other countries as well.
Third, GR may be adopted and have a positive impact, but one that is difficult to perceive or measure, so that little “credit” is given to the innovation. To rem- edy this situation, it will be important to undertake edu- cation campaigns to inform any skeptical farmers, consumers, or NGOs about the nutritional benefits of GR (assuming a successful variety is developed) and its benefits for farmers. Such campaigns will be important for ensuring widespread adoption as well as giving due credit once it is adopted.
Many members of the educated general public in Asia are convinced that most new technologies hurt farmers, especially if the corporate sector is involved in the technology. To some extent, this is a legacy of the Green Revolution, which is still viewed with skepticism by many even though it increased productivity, has been adopted widely by farmers, and was a major force in averting the widespread famines forecast by many observers. As a specific example, many people assume that because of the corporate sector’s involvement in the origins of GR, farmers will need to purchase this seed every year. While this is true for many crops in devel- oped economies, no company at present has plans to commercialize GR in developing countries. In addition, the technology to create GR was donated by its inven- tors and private companies holding intellectual property licenses so that any organization or farmer can freely distribute or replant seed. Thus, farmers will be under

no compulsion to buy new seeds every year, but this fact will need to be clearly and creatively communicated to the public. The public may also need to be convinced that a reasonable share of benefits from adoption of GR goes to farmers. Economists typically assume that adop- tion by farmers is prima facie evidence that it provides them benefits, but this line of reasoning is not necessar- ily convincing to others.
Future Potential and Lessons for Other Biofortification Efforts
GR technology still needs considerable research invest- ment to be viable in farmers’ fields and to meet a rigor- ous standard for consumer safety. Moving past regulatory hurdles will not be easy, and thus, this crop is unlikely to play a role in meeting micronutrient needs before the next decade.
From the political standpoint, there are still no advo- cates for this technology within Asian countries. Minis- tries of Agriculture and NARS are production-oriented by training and mandate; thus, they have little interest in a project that diverts attention from production goals and requires innovative cooperation with nutritional sci- ence. The IP arrangements have not given participating NARS a sense of ownership or control of this technol- ogy. Ministries of Health may find that biofortification poses a threat to their traditional programs, although it can potentially save lives and government expenditures in the long run. NGOs have yet to embrace this technol- ogy.
To move forward, it seems clear that GR must be agronomically viable at a minimum. To be acceptable to consumers and accomplish its nutritional goals will require that countries make some strategic decisions about implementation, adoption, and promotion. Such decisions include desirable beta-carotene levels, target populations, desirable agronomic characteristics, and methods for distribution and promotion. These choices would be best informed if the health and agricultural policy-makers can agree on the need for and potential benefits from this technology and if NGOs who work with the poor embrace it. As this approach to biofortifi- cation is relatively challenging, future investments in research need to increasingly be driven by policy dia- logue.
The GR story provides guidance for other biofortifi- cation efforts. First, any biofortification of a staple crop using GM technology will likely encounter greater political resistance, as well as more challenges in safety assessments and delivery, than non-GM approaches.
AgBioForum, 10(3), 2007 | 159
Second, any biofortification effort will need support and guidance from NARS and NGOs within countries with nutritionally deficient populations in order to be designed and targeted appropriately. These lessons for future strategy are explored further in the final article in this special issue.

Introduction
Genome editing of livestock is advancing rapidly as a technical field and may be poised to become com- mercial reality. Yet questions remain as to appropriate regulation, potential impact on the industry sector and public acceptability of products. This paper examines some of the complexity and ambiguity in incorporat- ing genome edited animals into a food production system. It takes as its starting point the commercial introduction of genetically modified crops, and some of the issues raised by early applications of genetic modification to crops.
The commercial introduction of genetically mod- ified (GM) crops in the early 1990s was initially fairly uncontroversial. The widespread introduction in maize, soya and oilseed rape, however, resulted in social campaigns against GM crops in Europe and elsewhere. Nevertheless, annual surveys from ISAAA (2015) indicate widespread adoption of a limited number of modified crops species (mostly oilseed rape, soya and maize) and a limited number of traits (mostly herbicide tolerance and insect resistance). The research pipeline continues to offer novel crop appli- cations (Parisi et al. 2016), although their penetration into practical use has been slow to date. In contrast, there are no genetically modified (GM) food animals

 being sold for food at the time of writing, to my knowledge.
Several recent developments look set to change this picture. The advent of genome editing techniques, especially CRISPR-Cas9, is enabling changes to be made at the DNA level, much more easily, precisely and cheaply. The recent approvals of genetically modified salmon for consumption both by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015), and Health Canada (2016) provide evidence that it is possible for GM products to satisfy regulatory requirements. In addition, cheaper and faster DNA sequencing is leading to increased understanding of the underlying genetic basis of traits. Together these developments potentially open up new opportunities for mar- ketable genetic modification in food animal produc- tion traits, hitherto unachievable.
Technological advances on their own are insuffi- cient for market penetration, however. An entire production system is involved, encompassing breed- ers, producers, different markets, retailers and con- sumers as well as regulators, animal welfare advocates, veterinarians and other pertinent stake- holders. And, most critically, products have to be acceptable to publics. A livestock production system thus consists of multiple stakeholders, each adapting to shifting circumstances and opportunities in differ- ent ways, but interacting with each other, and affecting each other. These stakeholders each respond to scientific developments, adjustments in markets, changes in methods of production, and economic and social pressures, in their own ways. The result is a kaleidoscope of multiple complex interactions. This paper explores some of this complexity and implica- tions of adoption of genome edited livestock. It does this in the context of early developments in GM crops and their regulation.
This paper draws on long-term observation of developments in genetics and livestock (e.g. Bruce and Bruce 1998), including scientific developments, regulatory changes, ethical and social challenges and industry action. Evidence is based on publications (including grey literature) and attendance at scientific, regulatory and industry meetings, as well as formal and informal conversations with individual stakehold- ers in livestock production systems. Rapidly develop- ing new technologies are offering novel possibilities that could be attractive to the livestock production sector, making an investigation of this subject timely.
This paper seeks to extend the recent focus of publications on regulation of genome edited livestock to a more systems-oriented approach, and suggests that further investigation of interactions among the stakeholders involved in livestock production is therefore important.
This exploration of complexity starts with a review of the current possible applications of genome editing to livestock, based on publicly available data. It shows how choices made by scientists regarding applications to be developed have responded to criticisms of the early developments in GM crops. Having established what kind of genome edited products might be in the pipeline, the next question considered is how these developments relate to some of the key issues which could affect their acceptance. These include argu- ments around naturalness, transgenesis and regulation that were raised by GM crops. Here I reflect on both the similarities and differences between genetic mod- ification and genome editing. Regulation will also affect the relative competitiveness of different types of companies; who might be the winners and who the losers? The introduction of genome editing will impact on other sectors of the livestock production system. I will focus particularly on interactions with veterinarians, given that many applications of genome editing currently relate to disease resistance. Finally, I reflect on the broader challenges to livestock produc- tion and how genome editing relates to these chal- lenges. The perspective will be European, and more specifically from the UK.
Possibilities of genome edited animals
Animals produced by genome editing offer the promise of precision modification to DNA, which older methods also offered, but in some respects failed to deliver. New precision engineering of the genome (Fahrenkrug et al. 2010) is in contrast to the traditional GM methods that largely relied on transfer of genes between species (Clark and Whitelaw 2003). Early enthusiasm at the prospects from GM animals (e.g. Bulfield 1990) dissipated as producing commercial GM animals proved to be more challenging than seemed at first. A number of developments in molec- ular biology have taken place over the last 15 year, including gene manipulation, methods of introducing genetic changes into animals, and understanding the
123

387
 underlying genetics (Bruce et al. 2013; Laible et al. 2015; Tan et al. 2016). In particular, the introduction of genome editing tools have revitalised the research area.
Genome editing involves the use of molecular ‘scissors’ to introduce changes into existing DNA, as opposed to classical genetic modification which often involved moving genes from one species to another. Genome editing also enables a much wider-range of changes, for example, gene knock-out, base pair substitution, targeted insertion/deletion of larger genomic regions, and modulation of gene expression (e.g. Tan et al. 2016; Van Eenennaam 2017).
Social pressures to produce real benefits
In selecting which applications to focus on, many of the developers of genome edited animals have sought to learn from the controversies surrounding GM crops, as well as welfare and ethical issues particular to animals. Some early research applications of GM to animals had also been subject to considerable scrutiny regarding both animal welfare and the ethical accept- ability of the procedures. Technology that was already controversial in a crop context is perceived as even more problematic when applied to sentient organisms, such as farmed livestock (Coles et al. 2015). One of the lessons taken by developers of genome edited animals is that applications with an animal welfare benefit would be expected to be much more acceptable to publics than livestock with production advantages. This is reflected in some of the early applications of genome editing to livestock.
One of the early applications of genome editing is to produce cows without horns (Recombinetics 2016). Dairy cows with horns can harm each other and their caretakers. Therefore it is common practice within the industry to remove the horns from calves by chemical or other means. This removal of horns is an unpleasant procedure, which it would be beneficial to avoid. Cows without horns (known as ‘polled’) exist natu- rally, but they tend to be beef cattle with much poorer milking ability. Using selective breeding to increase the incidence of the polled gene variant (allele) in the dairy herd would involve a very long process, particularly if milk yield was maintained at the same time. However, this gene variant has been introduced into dairy cows directly using genome editing (Re- combinetics 2016). The question remains whether
publics and animal welfare advocates perceive the animal welfare benefit to be of sufficient magnitude to justify such a biotechnological intervention. Whereas people working directly with dairy cattle will be aware of the processes involved in dehorning, and the benefits of not having to do so, most publics are likely to be unaware that dehorning processes take place, let alone what these involve in practice. The advan- tages of polled dairy cattle will not be immediately obvious to those not versed in agricultural practice, and the need for dehorning may be considered shocking.
Increased disease resistance is another area that has been addressed by genome editing, again with per- ceived animal welfare benefits. Examples include pigs tolerant to a fatal pig disease African Swine Fever (Lillico et al. 2013) and pigs resistance to a serious respiratory and reproductive disease, Porcine Repro- ductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) (Whit- worth et al. 2016). PRRS is an endemic pig disease in numerous countries and has few treatment possibili- ties. It negatively affects animal welfare and causes large economic losses. African Swine Fever is a pig disease endemic in Africa that causes up to 100% mortality and for which effective treatments and vaccines are not available. The disease has spread to Russia, and most recently to Eastern Europe, where it is seen as a threat to Western European pig production. Warthogs are found to be tolerant to African Swine Fever and inspired a genome editing method which has introduced the same tolerance alleles into domes- ticated pigs in an experimental setting (Lillico et al. 2013).
The benefits of other applications of genome editing may be perceived as more ambivalent. Genome editing has been used to produce more muscular animals in a variety of species, including pigs, cattle and sheep, by introducing a change in the myostatin gene (Cyranoski 2015; Proudfoot et al. 2015). The same change is naturally present in some breeds of cattle. In the public mind, muscular appear- ance often has connotations of poor welfare. Belgian Blue cattle and Pietrain pigs are two breeds that are muscular in appearance and of concern to animal welfare advocates. Belgian Blue cattle have a high incidence of problems when calving, and muscular breeds of pigs have been associated with high mortality rates. The causal mutation is in the myostatin gene in Belgian Blue cattle and the ryanodine
123

388
receptor/halothane gene in the Pietrain pig. The question arises whether animal welfare advocates are likely to be concerned by physical appearance, the specific genetic change, both, or neither? The exper- imental introduction reported by Proudfoot et al. (2015) was in the context of very poorly muscled cattle breeds, the resulting offspring physically appearing normal rather than excessively muscled. The myo- statin mutation also appears naturally in other breeds such as Highland cattle, without apparent associated welfare problems, so it may be possible to make the case that editing the myostatin gene provides a benefit in specific circumstances. However, the benefit is for production rather than animal welfare. It is less easy to see how a strong case can be made for more muscled pigs if muscling in pigs is associated with poor welfare (even when caused by a different genetic change). Public perceptions associating muscled animals with poor animal welfare can be difficult to shift and applications resulting in increased muscling may therefore prove to be controversial.
As is common with novel technologies, early innovations frequently use material which is readily available, such as already known gene variants. It seems likely that increasingly innovative genome edits will be developed. Suggestions in the scientific literature include: producing offspring of a single sex (e.g. for milk or egg production) (Fan et al. 2013; Tan et al. 2013), improved welfare by avoiding castration (Tan et al. 2013), and the prevention of the production of allergens and prion proteins in animals (Yao et al. 2014; Ni et al. 2014). Genome editing also has applications beyond the production of food animals, notably for research for understanding biological processes, in improved models of human diseases and potentially for production of animals for xenotransplantation. How- ever, medical applications will not be considered further in this paper.
Early applications of genome editing that come to public attention are likely to shape how people think about genome edited animals. These applications are likely to influence what people think genome edited animals are, and the purposes for which they have been developed. The choices made amongst possible applications of genome editing to animals are there- fore important. Benefits perceived by scientific or agricultural stakeholders, however, may be sometimes difficult to convey to lay people.
Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398 Is genome editing natural?
An important feature of GM crops is that they are viewed as unnatural by some people. The concept of naturalness is complex, and cannot be considered in detail in this article. However, as a recent report from the UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics (2015) indi- cates, naturalness should not be totally dismissed as an argument because most people recognise the concept as capturing something valid which should be taken into account. The question remains as to whether any breach of the natural order caused by genome editing would constitute a moral hazard.
Since all genome edited applications rely on laboratory intervention to develop parent animals, at some level, all involve a degree of human artifice. Bruce (2016), reflecting on whether genome editing is ‘unnatural’ or not from a moral reasoning perspective, suggests that it is important to consider the nature of the change brought about by genome editing. If selective breeding (genetic selection) is considered natural, and if the functional change brought about by genome editing could have been achieved by selective breeding, then it could be argued that there is little reason to object to genome editing in principle. An example is producing polled dairy cows. In this case, the same DNA sequence exists in nature and in the context of the same species. The question remains as to why it would be seen as natural to undertake selective breeding for a specific aim, but unnatural to do the same in a laboratory using genome editing.
Genome editing may produce changes that are not known to exist naturally in that species. But if these could reasonably have occurred naturally, even if they remained unrecognised by livestock breeders, it could be argued that these changes are also ‘natural’. The editing of resistance to PRRS into pigs might fit this category, as it is a mutational knock-out of gene function (Burkard et al. 2017).
It is easier to categorise as unnatural those appli- cations where the resulting animal is unlikely to have been achieved by normal mutation, for example producing offspring of a single sex. It is therefore possible to advance arguments that some genome edited animals are more unnatural than others. There is a similarity here with GM crops. It is possible to breed crop plants resistant to specific herbicides using traditional breeding methods, although the genetic basis for the resistance may vary between GM crops

389
 and non-GM crops. Equally, it is possible to produce novel applications by genetic modification, as exem- plified both in GM crops and GM animals. It is notable that the few current commercial applications of genetic modification to animals involve the pro- duction of pharmaceutical proteins (in milk or eggs). These traits are unnatural, yet have utility to humans. Clearly, just because something is considered unnat- ural, does not necessarily mean it is undesirable. Similarly, some natural mutations may be judged undesirable.
Although philosophers, theologians, ethicists and scientists may contest the various arguments as to what constitutes naturalness, lay publics may conceive of naturalness on a more intuitive basis. Such percep- tion of unnaturalness can be very difficult to argue against.
Is genome editing genetic modification?
The next lesson learned from experience with GM crops is the controversial nature of moving genes across species. An emphasis found in many scientific papers is that genome editing does not necessarily mean transgenic. Furthermore there is a tendency to equate transgenic with genetically modified. An example can be found in the report of genome editing for resistance to PRRS (Whitworth et al. 2016) which explicitly states that the resultant pigs are not trans- genic and therefore not genetically modified. This assertion is controversial, as the concept of what is genetic modification varies both legally and, more particularly, socially.
If the term ‘genetically modified’ is viewed as synonymous with ‘transgenic’, the implication is that since genome editing does not require the transfer of DNA from one species to another, then genome edited organisms, including livestock, are not genetically modified. This semantic difference may be attractive to proponents of genome edited animals, but it is unlikely to convince everyone, given the technology has developed in the context of genetic modification, and can be viewed as evolving from those techniques. The mere fact that genome editing comes from the same ‘stable’ as genetic modification can be sufficient to give it the same association.
On the other hand genome editing could also be viewed as distinct from genetic modification. Genome editing involves harnessing the cell’s natural repair
mechanisms to induce a specific change at a precise location in the genome. This type of change could have happened by natural mutation. Genome editing could therefore be viewed as ‘induced mutation’, with parallels to using radiation to induce mutations in plants (although the latter is of course, random, and would be unacceptable if applied to animals). How- ever, genome editing is not perfectly controlled due to ‘off-site’ effects, although recent research suggest that off-site effects can be controlled to a large extent (Tan et al. 2016) and gene sequencing could be used to detect presence or absence of off-site effects.
An alternative framing for genome editing could be Marker Assisted Selection. Marker Assisted selection relies on taking biological samples from animals and analysing these for the presence or absence of genetic markers associated with specific traits. Some of these markers (such as the ryanodine receptor/halothane gene) are single nucleotide changes. Marker Assisted Selection has been viewed more favourably than genetic modification by some stakeholder groups. For example Greenpeace has advocated Marker Assisted Selection in crop plants, on the basis of (1) respecting species barriers; (2) increasing the efficiency of traditional breeding without replacing it; and (3) treating genomes as coherent entities rather than transferring isolated gene sequences (Greenpeace International 2009).
Genome editing has some similarities with Marker Assisted Selection. It does not necessarily transgress species barriers and arguably treats the genome as a coherent entity in so far as any change involved is mimicking a natural mutation. However, genome editing does require a deliberate intervention that is not possible without biotechnological capability that is outside traditional farming practice. On the other hand, ‘traditional’ farming practice has already been supplemented in many cases by centralised specialist procedures that lie outside the traditional farming sphere. These include central performance testing, semen distribution, data collection, sophisticated sta- tistical analysis, and in the case of marker assisted selection above, biological sampling and analysis. Selective breeding is based on phenotypes, and separation of genotype and environment using statis- tical methods. This has further developed into genomic selection, which involves the use of tens of thousands of genetic markers across the genome rather than relying on individual markers. Genomic selection
123

390
Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398
 has been made possible through increases in comput- ing power, easier and cheaper availability of genotype information, and developments in statistical tech- niques. Genomic selection is being applied commer- cially in, for example, dairy cattle. Since the physical animal has already been ‘converted’ into data, and these data are increasingly converted to genetic information though genome selection, it seems a short step to begin to manipulate these DNA changes in purposeful ways. Genome editing and genome selec- tion may even become integrated, as suggested by Jenko et al. (2015). Thus the boundary between current practice of genomic selection and genome editing may become increasingly blurred.
What then is genome editing? Is it genetic modi- fication? Induced mutation? Marker Assisted Selec- tion? Or genome selection? Or something else? From the above discussion, these definitions cannot be answered merely from a scientific perspective, because genetic modification has become as much a social concept as a scientific concept.
The nuances that these descriptions capture for a scientific audience can be difficult to understand for those outside this specialist sphere. Evidence from psychology suggests that when confronted by a new phenomenon, people tend to use a fast way of thinking in order to make sense of that phenomenon (e.g. Forgas 2001; Kahneman 2011). This way of thinking seeks to identify what the new phenomenon is similar to, rather than carefully evaluating all the details. The results of this type of thinking can seem illogical to those versed in the details of a technology. In this way, for example, for a lay audience, genome editing could easily be rolled in with genetic modification, cloning and tasteless tomatoes in supermarkets.
It would of course be advantageous for developers of genome edited animals if they were able to avoid the onerous regulations associated with genetic mod- ification, so the argument that genome edited animals are not genetically modified because they are not transgenic, is attractive. In this next section I consider the interactions between genome editing and regulation.
GM regulation and genome editing
Two aspects of regulation are considered in this section. The first is whether genome edited animals
should be subject to the same regulations as GM animals. Here, I will primarily take an EU perspective, given the variety of regulatory approaches around the world. In this context, the main question is whether genome editing counts as genetic modification and is therefore subject to GM regulations? The second reflection is on the impacts that GM crop regulation has had on industry structures and the relative competitiveness of different sectors.
GM regulation and genome editing
GM salmon (AquAdvantageTM) modified for faster growth, has been at the forefront, worldwide, of the regulatory process for GM animals for food produc- tion (Van Eenennaam and Muir 2011). However, the approval process for AquAdvantageTM salmon (which used classical GM technology) was extremely oner- ous, and supporters of genome edited animals advo- cate much simpler, or even no regulatory constraints for genome edited animals.
The EU regulatory system was developed in the context of GM crops, is process based and depends on a specific definition of genetic modification. The EU defines a genetically modified organism as:
an organism, with the exception of human beings, in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination (Directive 2001/18/EC, Article 2(2))
A key question is therefore whether genome editing legally constitutes genetic modification in the EU or not? While the EU continues to debate this issue, some preliminary decisions have been made elsewhere.
A number of genome edited organisms have been determined to fall outside the regulatory purview of the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) e.g. mushrooms edited using CRISPR-Cas9 to reduce browning (Waltz 2016). However, regulatory oversight in the USA is not triggered by whether the process involves genetic modification. Rather the regulatory triggers for GM organisms are determined by the underlying laws and regulatory authorities of each U.S. regulatory agency and depends on the nature of the product. Similarly genome edited crop plants, such as canola, have gained Plant Novel Trait approval in Canada (Cibus 2014), where again regulation is not triggered by
123

 whether the process involves genetic modification. Within the EU there continues to be debate as to the regulatory status of plants produced by genome editing, with a variety of different interpretations being put forward (European Parliament 2016). The Swedish Board of Agriculture has concluded that some applications of CRISPR-Cas9 do not fall under the EU definition of a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) and the German Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety has come to a similar conclusion (European Parliament 2016).
On January 18, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017) released for public comment their Draft Guidance on the Regulation of Intention- ally Altered Genomic DNA in Animals. The draft guidance recommends that genome edited animals should be regulated in a manner similar to that used by the agency to regulate GM animals. At the time of writing, the draft guidance was still in the public comment period.
The narrow consideration of whether genome editing is a form of genetic modification or not, does not of course address the questions of what is the purpose of regulation. From the perspective of differ- ent genetic changes, Van Eenennaam and Young (2015), cogently argue that current regulatory regimes fail to reflect the scientific evaluation of risks from different applications. In practice, however, objections to developments may be on grounds other than risk, but are nevertheless expressed in terms of risk, as the only effective way of stopping a development that is unwanted (Tait 2001). Examples of such objections with respect to GM crops include excessive power of commercial companies over food systems and exces- sive industrialisation of agricultural practices. There is no clear mechanism where such objections can be considered, and hence arguments against develop- ments tend to focus on risk.
In the context of GM crops, suggestions have been made to establish ways of facilitating more open debate around the non-science based evaluations applied to policy decisions and making the basis for policy decisions more explicit (Devos et al. 2013). Areas suggested for more open debate by Devos et al. include clarifying policy objectives, determining what constitutes environmental (and by analogy animal welfare) harm, making explicit the normative basis of risk assessments (what level of risk is acceptable and
who should bear the risk), and weighing harms against benefits.
If genome editing is to be harnessed for animal welfare, environmental or social benefit then some kind of regulatory or other ‘carrot’ to drive in these directions, would provide the greatest opportunity for such developments, rather than merely relying on markets. An example from another industry sector, is the U.S. Food Quality Protection Act that gives preference to pesticides which provide environmen- tal benefits over current products. Some jurisdictions in Europe already include requirements for social benefit in the context of regulatory approval of biotechnology-derived animals. For example, Nor- way requires GMOs to benefit society and be ethically justifiable as well as not harmful (Library of Congress 2014). In Denmark cloning and genetic modification of animals is restricted to applications benefitting human health and the environment (NordForsk 2016). In the Netherlands, genetic mod- ification of animals for food purposes needs a license requiring the product to serve a public interest and have no overriding ethical objections (Government of the Netherlands 2016). However, these are all examples of regulatory ‘sticks’, designed to prevent applications, rather than ‘carrots’ designed to pro- mote applications considered to be particularly beneficial.
Regulatory regimes for genome edited livestock remain unclear, however, attempting to avoid all regulation could stimulate accusations that genome editing is trying to avoid public debate. By hiding the nature of genome editing developments people may be prevented from having any choice in the matter. Even if the regulatory regime for GM organisms is judged excessive for genome edited organisms, some kind of opportunity for public debate, and provision of methods for identifying products from genome edited animals seems necessary. For example, setting stan- dards for genome edited animals, perhaps drawing on the experiences of regulation of medical devices. Given that producing genome edited animals will require serious investment, it is likely that developers will seek to recoup costs by selling the resulting breeding animals at a premium, and therefore will not seek to ‘hide’ the fact that the animal is a result of genome editing. Nevertheless, such public perceptions may persist.

 Interaction between regulation and company strategies
Turning now to the second aspect of regulation, that of interactions between regulation, company strategies, relative competitiveness and innovation trajectories. Regulation arguable impacts are not just on the safety and efficacy of innovations but also on company strategies and the types of firm likely to be successful (Mittra et al.2011). Tait (2007) suggests that adopting a high regulatory burden for GM crops meant that large, multinational agrochemical companies were favoured over traditional crop seed producing firms. The agrochemical companies had both the funds and the expertise to deal with complex regulatory require- ments, which the seed companies did not have. If genome edited livestock will be required to comply with the same regulatory standards as GM crops, then again companies with the resources to cope with such regulatory burdens are likely to be favoured.
Analysis of agrochemical company strategies (Tait 2007; Tait and Chataway 2007) suggested that genetic modification of crops was disruptive innovation for this industry sector. Agrochemical companies used to innovation based on small chemical molecules needed novel innovation pathways for producing GM crops. The companies could not continue using existing innovation pathways, but instead required path-break- ing innovation involving new areas of research and new markets. At early stages of development of GM crops, agrochemical companies used various strate- gies to deal with this disruptive innovation, including acquiring seed companies (Monsanto and Dupont), collaborating with seed companies (AgrEvo, Zeneca, Novartis, Rhine Poulenc and Dow) or waiting to observe developments (BASF and Bayer) (Mittra et al. 2011).
In comparison, GM crops would have been incre- mental innovation for traditional seed producing companies. They could have continued their current innovation trajectories and gained competitive advan- tage through existing business practices (Tait 2007). Tait (2007) further suggests that had seed companies produced GM crops, the public outcome for GM crops may have been very different. The high standard of evidence required to satisfy regulatory requirements, however, has meant that regulation has effectively acted as a barrier to entry for smaller traditional seed producing firms (Tait 2007).
Research papers reporting the achievement of a few genome edited animals are important accounts of scientific advancements. However, it is not enough just to produce three or four genome edited animals for the application to become commercially viable. To produce a commercially viable product, the number of animals needs to be increased, and the animals and their products accepted by a range of stakeholders, including animal breeders, farmers, vets and super- market chains, as well as successfully negotiate any regulatory barriers. A plausible route to market is needed. In the case of genome edited animals, current developments appear to include those where a plau- sible route to market is developing. For example a major, global livestock breeding company, Genus plc, has announced it has an exclusive licence to use genome editing to commercially produce pigs resis- tant to PRRS (Genus 2015).
The international livestock breeding sector is well organised, particularly when considering chickens, pigs and dairy cows, although with some heterogene- ity. A number of global breeding companies dominate the sector. Specialist breeding companies undertake genetic selection to produce the next generation of livestock, multiply this stock (and often produce cross breeds) and sell to commercial farmers. Unlike crops, where the whole population can be rapidly replaced, introducing genome editing into a livestock popula- tion is a much more complex and time consuming process.
Although the entry of one major breeding company into genome editing is noted, the breeding company model is not the only one in existence in the supply of breeding stock, as state intervention in livestock breeding has been common in many European coun- tries. As with other industry sectors, there is evidence that the breeding sector has been shaped in part by regulation. In France, for example, state intervention, and then the withdrawal of the state from the breeding sector has had a profound impact on the commercial stakeholders (Hannachi and Tichit 2016). The 1966 Livestock Act, introduced to encourage the use of Artificial Insemination, resulted in the creation of monopoly breeder co-operatives in different regions, and the loss of influence by key individual breeders. The later Agricultural Orientation Law (2006) resulted in loss of state intervention, which together with technological changes due to the introduction of genomic selection, allowed the entry of multinational
123

Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398
393
 companies into the breeding sector. Hannachi and Tichit argue the result is that cattle breeding in France has moved from being a collective, collaborative exercise, to one that is practiced individually and characterised by competition (Hannachi and Tichit 2016). This is an example from the livestock produc- tion sector of the influence that regulation can play on subsequent industry development.
The nature of the genome editing application may also have an impact on the innovation trajectory and its impact on different parts of the livestock production system. Applications such as polledness are likely to be path-dependent for farms, although suppliers of materials to dehorn animals may see their markets decline and may need to identify novel markets. A cow which does not develop horns is still just a cow and the basic farm business model is not disrupted by its lack of horns. The hornlessness reflects improved animal welfare, labour savings in avoiding an unpleasant task and economic savings in materials and labour. How- ever, other potential genome edited products have the potential for more disruptive impacts.
The ability to avoid the need for castrating animals could have stronger animal welfare benefits, and additional benefits in reduced labour requirements, as well as better performance from animals that do not suffer a growth-check from the procedure. The process may also be potentially disruptive, for example if this allows novel meat products to be developed as pigs could be slaughtered at heavier weights if the taste taint from males is absent. An application which provides the ability of only producing commercially useful animals of the desirable sex has the potential to be disruptive in ways which are hard to predict, as reproduction could be limited to specific farms. There may need to be novel social or institutional arrange- ments that allow maintenance of the parent animals of both sexes, with consequent impacts on costs of production and distribution of control and ownership of breeding stock.
Public acceptability of such radical applications also need to be questioned. Few such data exist currently, although for example an on-line survey in the Netherlands (Gremmen and Blok 2016) asked respondents to compare the acceptability of a number of different options for dealing with unwanted male chicks in egg production. The respondents in this survey considered that genetically modifying chickens so that eggs with male chicks could be identified by
green fluorescence, was more acceptable than taking biological samples from non-genetically modified eggs to identify males by laboratory means. Although this is a small example, and may not be reflected in broader acceptability of using genome editing to alter sex ratios, it does indicate the importance of examin- ing public attitudes rather than presuming them.
Within the livestock production systems, different stakeholders are likely to be affected in different ways. Genome edited animals are sold to farmers not consumers. For farmers, genome edited animals are likely to be incremental innovations, whose manage- ment is path dependent. The ‘product’ is after all, a cow or pig, like any other. There may be additional recording and identification requirements if labelling and co-existence requirements are similar to those for GM crops in the EU. However, the demands for recording individual animals and animal movements in the EU are already considerable.
For breeders without laboratory science expertise, developing genome edited animals is likely to be path breaking, requiring the acquisition of new skills. However, larger companies in this sector have a very high degree of technical absorptive capacity. Distri- bution of genome edited animals is likely to be path dependent as the methods of distribution depend on the physical material. However, meeting the require- ments of intellectual property regimes allied to genome edited animals may prove to be disruptive. Hitherto the intellectual property in livestock breeding has been primarily protected by secrecy and use of cross-breeding. Genome edited animals could be path- dependent for meat processors and retailers, unless there are consumer requirements for labelling or campaigns against such products, in which case genome edited animals could require new business practices to be developed. One sector that could easily be affected, and for whom this is potentially a path- breaking development, is the veterinary sector.
Veterinary sector
Disease control is an initial focus for several genome editing projects, the examples of African Swine Fever and PRRS were given above. These diseases have few or no alternative treatments and also pose a significant economic threat to pig production. If genome edited disease resistant or tolerant animals are to be widely
123

394
Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398
 adopted, disease resistance would need to be incorpo- rated into overall disease management strategies at the individual farm, or even national, level.
Genetic disease resistance is intended to be used in disease prevention. However, based on a historical analysis of UK veterinary practice, Woods (2013) argues that vets have used the rhetoric of disease prevention, but found it difficult to deliver in practice for a variety of reasons. They have instead maintained an approach that focusses on treatments. Woods suggests that for effective prevention, an appropriate combination of veterinary, disease, farming and political drivers are required, all of which promote disease prevention. An important step is to engage the veterinary profession and other appropriate stakehold- ers to identify the drivers necessary for genome edited animals to be harnessed for animal health improve- ment. Some reflections on issues worth exploring are given in the following paragraphs.
Genome edited animals are unlikely to be adopted by all farmers. Therefore, it is likely that disease resistant or tolerant (depending on the nature of the edit), and disease susceptible animals would co-exist in commercial populations. Understanding the epi- demiological implications (if any) of introducing a novel resistance trait to some animals, could be one of the questions being addressed. Such an examination could also uncover veterinarians’ perceptions of genome edited disease resistant animals and the potential impact of such animals on their work.
Veterinarians are responsible for implementing disease control measures, particularly where there are specific legal requirements for doing so. This would be the case should there be a suspected emergence of African Swine Fever in the UK, for example. Genome editing thus could have much wider implications, because the suspicion that a notifiable disease of international significance is present can cause major disruption to international trade. The potential implications of genome editing for disease resistance in the event of any future outbreak of such diseases could therefore be explored by a range of stakeholders.
Part of the current European policy landscape is that the costs of exotic disease prevention should be shared between government and farmers, as opposed to governments bearing all the costs of exotic disease prevention. Could farmers be encouraged to keep disease resistant livestock by being given a greater
compensation if they do so, if an exotic disease outbreak were to occur? Farmer behaviour related to livestock disease is complex and context specific (Barnes et al. 2015). But if farmers were to be offered higher compensation for adopting disease resistant animals, then the resistance would need to be attested to in some way. This suggests the need for some kind of standards certification, which would identify ani- mals with appropriate disease resistance characteristics.
While these considerations are not unique to genome edited animals—some of the same could apply to selective breeding for disease resistance— addressing these types of questions could be important when considering commercial realities of genome edited animals. Taking account of the way in which veterinarians’ practices interact with genome edited animals in different circumstances would test interac- tions among different parts of a livestock production system.
The future of livestock production
GM crops were introduced in the late 1990s at a time when the use of chemicals in agriculture had become controversial. Advocating the introduction of crops that promoted the use of a pesticide or herbicide (although environmentally more benign than some others) in this context provided a ready basis for public resistance. There are currently many different (and often competing) visions for the future of livestock agriculture that set the wider context for genome editing. For example, the sector has come under intense pressure from environmental considerations, particularly the need to reduce greenhouse gas emis- sions, while at the same time responding to the imperative to increase livestock production to feed burgeoning populations (Godfrey et al. 2010). A recent policy paper from a European livestock indus- try perspective starts from the premise that the livestock sector has been identified as the world’s largest user of natural resources (Knowledge for Innovation 2015). This policy paper calls for innova- tion in the livestock sector that is environmentally sound, socially responsible and economically viable. The extent to which genome edited animals can contribute to visions of the future of agriculture will impact on future trajectories. Many different future
123

Transgenic Res (2017) 26:385–398
395
 visions exist. Two contrasting visions are provided here, as exemplars.
One vision of the future of agriculture focusses on the current, conventional, global systems of livestock production as typifying such a future. Typically, farms would continue to provide livestock products for global markets, with a strong emphasis on the efficiency of production. This vision would be likely to embrace application of various technologies such as exploiting information technology and the use of rapid environmental and biological diagnostics. Within this vision, measures to improve efficiency would be valued and might encompass a range of metrics, such as carbon footprints, the efficiency of use of animal feed for growth, and biological measures such as reproductive efficiency. Contributing to these effi- ciency measures would be viewed as contributing to delivering environmentally sound, socially responsi- ble and economically viable livestock production. In such a context, genome edited animals could be seen as consistent with these aspirations.
In contrast to the global production system, there are a group of alternative livestock production systems which aspire to transform the global production system. These alternative production systems are diverse, and include for example, Community Sup- ported Agriculture, urban agriculture, local produc- tion, and marketing through farmers’ markets and food hubs. They have developed partly as a way of resisting what is perceived as the dysfunctional current global production system. A key criticism of the global system is the way in which consumers have become separated from producers. Rather than emphasise metrics of efficiency, these alternative production systems stress equitable relationships between con- sumers and producers, and between livestock and human beings. Traditional forms of knowledge and use of breeds adapted to local conditions are empha- sised. New knowledge is by no means rejected but the role that genome edited animals could play in such a scenario is more questionable.
Genome editing for improved adaption to local conditions might be compatible with the aims of ‘alternative’ systems, for example if animals were edited to be more heat tolerant. However, genome editing may be rejected in principle by advocates of this future vision, on the grounds of reflecting an excessively instrumental relationship between humans and livestock. The emphasis in this future vision on
resistance to global livestock production systems may also militate against genome editing, if genome editing is perceived to be associated with those global systems.
Conclusions: key lessons for genome edited livestock
Genome editing promises the possibility of producing commercial livestock carrying precise genetic changes, which are difficult or impossible to achieve with selective breeding. Ultimately, the future of these developments will depend on political decisions, regulatory requirements and public acceptability, as well as technological capabilities. This paper has sought to draw on the experiences of the introduction of GM crops to examine the development of genome edited livestock. In particular, this paper extends the focus on science and regulation, to considering the wider context of livestock production systems.
Early applications of genome editing to livestock have taken into account the need to provide publicly recognised benefits, as a lesson learned from the production-focus of early GM crops applications. Initial applications have mainly focussed on welfare and disease resistance traits, although more profound changes to animal physiology have also been sug- gested, and may be realised in future. One of the challenges of meeting public aspirations for welfare benefit is the difficulty of agreeing on what is a welfare benefit. What may seem beneficial, or at least neutral, in terms of animal welfare for those familiar with livestock production, can be more controversial for others. Public views on more profound changes to physiology, e.g. altering sex ratios, are as yet, largely unexamined. In general attitudes are likely to be influenced by the particular reason given for the application, how beneficial or risky it is considered to be, and specific context of application and the alternatives available.
Early applications of genome editing in livestock have also focused on creating gene variants that exist in the same, or similar species, and seeking to avoid crossing species boundaries. Given the tendency among some people to conflate genetic modification with transgenesis, genome editing might be thought to provide an opportunity to avoid the regulatory impasse that in many cases has been a feature of GM animals.
123

 However, avoiding regulation for genome edited animals on the basis that they do not involve crossing species barriers would restrict applications of genome editing only to those that meet this requirement, and could discourage many other developments. At the other extreme, avoiding any kind of regulation for genome edited animals could also easily result in a public back-lash. Some publics may see unregulated adoption of the technology as a way to introduce (by stealth) practices that they think are cruel or unnec- essary. A carefully nuanced mechanism for identify- ing and regulating genome edited animals seems essential.
Genome editing applied to livestock production is not just a technical fix that can be effortlessly adopted without consequences to the wider production system. Stakeholders in the wider industry may react in ways that perturb current practices. These perturbations can be application specific or context specific, and may be difficult to predict without engagement with a range of appropriate stakeholders. In the case of GM crops, regulatory requirements and company strategies led to multinational agrochemical companies being favoured over crop seed producers. Early indications for genome edited livestock are, that at least one global breeding company is willing to adopt genome editing and has the capacity to deliver genome edited livestock to farmers. Adoption of genome editing is consistent with the expertise present in this company. It is not clear what impact genome editing will have on other industry stakeholders, such as smaller breeding organisations or nationally supported breeding co- operatives.
Genome edited specific disease resistant livestock can have implications on management of disease, in particular diseases that are exotic to the particular jurisdiction and which have the potential to disrupt international trade. On the other hand, disease resistant livestock could be incorporated as part of a package of actions aimed at better prevention of disease.
The wider context of livestock production is also important to consider. Pressure is increasing on the sector to reduce its environmental impact, while maintaining productivity. Whether genome editing can contribute to these aspirations remains to be seen.
Public support for genome edited livestock is essential for the promised products to gain wide market penetration. Frivolous, or controversial appli- cations raising public disquiet have the potential to
make it very difficult for future genome edited livestock applications to be socially accepted. Com- petition to be the first on the market needs to be tempered by consideration of the wider future of the technology. Focussing on technology and its regula- tory implications is important but more attention needs to be paid to interactions among stakeholders to better understand how genome edited animals could impact the broader livestock production sector.

            <Text>Status of GMO Deployment
This section will deal with the status of GM products worldwide,
which is mostly the status of GM crops.
Points to make:
1. GM crops are being grown throughout most of the world.
2. Europe and Africa are the noticeable blank spots.
3. Food and feed are being imported more extensively than being grown.
4. Controversy still persists, which might give the impression that acceptance is low.
