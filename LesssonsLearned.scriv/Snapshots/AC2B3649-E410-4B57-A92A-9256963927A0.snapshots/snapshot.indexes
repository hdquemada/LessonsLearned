        <Text>Crops that have been genetically engineered or genetically modified (GM) have been in commercial production for 24 years, since the planting of the first GM soybean crop in 1996. As of 2018, 26 countries grew 192 million hectares of GM crops, with the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India growing the vast majority of that area. In addition to these countries, 44 are importing GM crop products ({ | ISAAA, 2018 | | |zu:5334702:QDQ4ENZ7}). In the United States, GM corn accounted for 92%, GM soybeans 94%, and GM cotton 96% of the acreage  planted in 2020 https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/47649/alltables.xls?v=6605.8 ,https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption .
This level of adoption throughout the world has resulted in significant socio-economic, health and environmental benefits. In 2018, farm income worldwide from GM crops was US$18.95 billion, with a cumulative total income of US$ 225 billion, with half of that income earned by developing country farmers ({ | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:88XJI3UF}). The 2018 annual farm income is equivalent to the Gross Domestic Product of many African countries https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD . Since 1996, the use of insect resistant GM crops has resulted the reduction 775.4 million kg of pesticides, and as a result, decreased the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on these crops ({ | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}). This reduction has direct benefits in terms of reducing farmer pesticide poisonings, as has been reported for China, India, Pakistan and South Africa (see { | Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M}, and references therein). For insect resistant maize, human health benefits are also inferred by the reduction levels of mycotoxins, which are toxic—causing neural tube defects—and carcinogenic ({ | Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M}). These effects are particularly beneficial in those developing countries where maize is the staple food. Environmental benefits are also implied to be the result of reduction in pesticide use, through the known impacts of these pesticides on wildlife ({ | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}{ | Siegrist, &amp; Hartmann, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:WCDRBP8C}).</Text>
