        <Text>Crops that have been genetically engineered or genetically modified (GM) have been in commercial production for 24 years, since the planting of the first GM soybean crop in 1996. As of 2018, 26 countries grew 192 million hectares of GM crops, with the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India growing the vast majority of that area. In addition to these countries, 44 are importing GM crop products ({ | ISAAA, 2018 | | |zu:5334702:QDQ4ENZ7}). In the United States, GM corn accounted for 92%, GM soybeans 94%, and GM cotton 96% of the acreage  planted in 2020 https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/47649/alltables.xls?v=6605.8 ,https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption .
This level of adoption throughout the world has resulted in significant socio-economic, health and environmental benefits. In 2018, farm income worldwide from GM crops was US$18.95 billion, with a cumulative total income of US$ 225 billion, with half of that income earned by developing country farmers ({ | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:88XJI3UF}). The 2018 annual farm income is equivalent to the Gross Domestic Product of many African countries https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD . Since 1996, the use of insect resistant GM crops has resulted the reduction 775.4 million kg of pesticides, and as a result, decreased the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on these crops ({ | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}). This reduction has direct benefits in terms of reducing farmer pesticide poisonings, as has been reported for China, India, Pakistan and South Africa (see { | Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M}, and references therein). For insect resistant maize, human health benefits are also inferred by the reduction levels of mycotoxins, which are toxic—causing neural tube defects—and carcinogenic ({ | Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M}). These effects are particularly beneficial in those developing countries where maize is the staple food. Environmental benefits are also implied to be the result of reduction in pesticide use, through the known impacts of these pesticides on wildlife ({ | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}{ | Siegrist, &amp; Hartmann, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:WCDRBP8C}).</Text>

It has been argued that the traits either already deployed or in development will address many of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals { | Adenle, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:MIXIR5WS}.
An interesting recent development has been the successful use of Bt cotton in the United States, in concert with classical pest control methods to eradicate pink bollworm, a major pest of cotton { | Tabashnik, et al., 2021 | | |zu:5334702:QZRA9963}. This example illustrates the compatibility of GM crops in an integrated pest management strategy to solve long-standing agricultural problems.
Box 1. Case Study: Bt Cotton in Burkina Faso
For several years, South Africa was the only country in Africa that had approved and grew GM crops, having approved the first transgenic events of Bt cotton on the continent in 1997https://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/event/default.asp?EventID=53. Burkina Faso granted official approval for Bt cotton in 2009, after a process of research and development conducted by the agricultural company, Monsanto, and Burkina Faso’s Institut de l'Environnement et des Recherches Agricoles (INERA)https://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/event/default.asp?EventID=59, although commercial-scale plantings had taken place in 2008 { | Vitale, et al., 2010 | | |zu:5334702:VPYXA7K4}{ | Luna, &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:EZXGIGVE}{ | Luna, &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:D3KFZUEE}. This cotton expressed two Bt proteins, Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab2, which conferred resistance to the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. Data from the first year of planting showed that the Bt cotton provided an average of 18.2%, resulting in an increase of US$61.88 per hectare (average farm size 3.2 hectares){ | Vitale, et al., 2010 | | |zu:5334702:VPYXA7K4}. Effective control of the pest continued in subsequent years (2010-2014), with an average increased yield 23.9% { | Héma, et al., 2017 | | |zu:5334702:6DXS6HG6}. By 2014, Bt cotton was being grown on 70% of the cotton production area in the country, or almost 500,000 hectares { | James, 2014 | | |zu:5334702:4NYPAXSE}. Nevertheless, concerns were expressed by some regarding the lack of attention paid to social concerns during the introduction of the product, as well as not taking into account the variability in yield in the reports of success { | Dowd-Uribe, 2014 | | |zu:5334702:9LKSENMC}{ | Luna, &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:D3KFZUEE}{ | Luna, &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:D3KFZUEE}. By 2012–2013, cotton companies noted that problems with fiber quality were observed { | Bourgou, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:IYILL2LE}. This is a concern because  Burkina Faso typically produces cotton that commands a premium price due to the length of the fiber. The loss of premium price was exacerbated by global oversupply and consequent overall price decrease for the commodity { | Bourgou, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:IYILL2LE}.  Consequently, by 2016 the planting of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso was suspended. There is no regulatory ban on the variety, leaving open the door for re-introduction of the product when the problem with fiber length is solved through conventional breeding.

Environmental benefits are also implied to be the result of reduction in pesticide use, through the known impacts of these pesticides on wildlife { | Brookes &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}{ | Siegrist &amp; Hartmann, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:WCDRBP8C}{ | Brookes, &amp; Dinh, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:SCEY3C2K}{ | Ahmed, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:FEBZYZ4Z}.
It has been argued that the traits either already deployed or in development will address many of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals { | Adenle, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:MIXIR5WS}</Text>

        <Text>Crops that have been genetically engineered or genetically modified (GM) have been in commercial production for 24 years, since the planting of the first GM soybean crop in 1996. As of 2018, 26 countries grew 192 million hectares of GM crops, with the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India growing the vast majority of that area. In addition to these countries, 44 are importing GM crop products (Figure 1). In Argentina, 18 million hectares of GM soy, 5.5 million hectares of GM maize, and 0.37 million hectares of cotton were planted in 2018, at at adoption rate (relative to total crop area) of 99% for GM soy, 97% for GM maize, and 93% for GM cotton { | ISAAA, 2018 | | |zu:5334702:QDQ4ENZ7}. In the United States, GM corn accounted for 92%, GM soybeans 94%, and GM cotton 96% of the acreage  planted in 2020 https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/47649/alltables.xls?v=6605.8 ,https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption . A striking feature of the map shown in Figure 1 is the relative absence of countries growing GM crops, or even importing them. One possible explanation for this phenomenon will be explored further in this report, and will also serve as the focus of the lessons learned from this field that could be applied to the research and development of gene drives.

This level of adoption throughout the world has resulted in significant socio-economic, health and environmental benefits. In 2018, farm income worldwide from GM crops was US$18.95 billion, with a cumulative total income of US$ 225 billion, with half of that income earned by developing country farmers { | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:88XJI3UF}. Studies reporting benefits in specific developing countries include those conducted in Bangladesh { | Ahmed, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:FEBZYZ4Z}{ | Shelton, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:EQP7TYY7},Honduras { | Macall, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:JHFVPBZV}, India { | Kathage, &amp; Qaim, 2012 | | |zu:5334702:TVGQ2PTR}, South Africa { | Ismael, et al., 2002 | | |zu:5334702:5EPHT4Q7}{ | Gouse, et al., 2004 | | |zu:5334702:6Z2AIA5S}{ | Hofs, et al., 2006 | | |zu:5334702:KIYV8QZ4}{ | Shew, et al., 2021 | | |zu:5334702:SKTPLH7R} and Burkina Faso (see Box 1 for more detail). The 2018 annual farm income is equivalent to the Gross Domestic Product of many African countries https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD . 
Since 1996, the use of insect resistant GM crops, expressing various various insecticidal proteins from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), has resulted the reduction 775.4 million kg of pesticides { | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}, and as a result, decreased the environmental impact associated with herbicide and insecticide use on these crops, as well as indirectly to farmers who did not use them { | Shelton, et al., 2002 | | |zu:5334702:TY7D7LQ6}{ | Cattaneo, et al., 2006 | | |zu:5334702:PBW77MMN}{ | Hutchison, et al., 2010 | | |zu:5334702:HF6GW8MN}{ | Kathage, &amp; Qaim, 2012 | | |zu:5334702:TVGQ2PTR}{ | Perry, et al., 2016 | | |zu:5334702:RDPMZSBN}{ | Dively, et al., 2018 | | |zu:5334702:8V4J94ZT}{ | Brookes, &amp; Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY}. This reduction has direct benefits in terms of reducing farmer pesticide poisonings, as has been reported for China, India, Pakistan and South Africa (see Smyth { | -Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M}, and references therein). For insect resistant maize, human health benefits are also inferred by the reduction levels of mycotoxins, which are toxic—causing neural tube defects—and carcinogenic { | Smyth, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:CFXPFW3M}. These effects are particularly beneficial in those developing countries where maize is the staple food {for example, Honduras,| Macall, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:JHFVPBZV}.

It has been argued that the traits either already deployed or in development will address many of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals { | Adenle, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:MIXIR5WS}.
An interesting recent development has been the successful use of Bt cotton in the United States, in concert with classical pest control methods to eradicate pink bollworm, a major pest of cotton { | Tabashnik, et al., 2021 | | |zu:5334702:QZRA9963}. This example illustrates the compatibility of GM crops in an integrated pest management strategy to solve long-standing agricultural problems.
Box 1. Case Study: Bt Cotton in Burkina Faso
For several years, South Africa was the only country in Africa that had approved and grew GM crops, having approved the first transgenic events of Bt cotton on the continent in 1997https://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/event/default.asp?EventID=53. Burkina Faso granted official approval for Bt cotton in 2009, after a process of research and development conducted by the agricultural company, Monsanto, and Burkina Faso’s Institut de l'Environnement et des Recherches Agricoles (INERA)https://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/event/default.asp?EventID=59, although commercial-scale plantings had taken place in 2008 { | Vitale, et al., 2010 | | |zu:5334702:VPYXA7K4}{ | Luna, &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:EZXGIGVE}{ | Luna, &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:D3KFZUEE}. This cotton expressed two Bt proteins, Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab2, which conferred resistance to the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. Data from the first year of planting showed that the Bt cotton provided an average of 18.2%, resulting in an increase of US$61.88 per hectare (average farm size 3.2 hectares){ | Vitale, et al., 2010 | | |zu:5334702:VPYXA7K4}. Effective control of the pest continued in subsequent years (2010-2014), with an average increased yield 23.9% { | Héma, et al., 2017 | | |zu:5334702:6DXS6HG6}. By 2014, Bt cotton was being grown on 70% of the cotton production area in the country, or almost 500,000 hectares { | James, 2014 | | |zu:5334702:4NYPAXSE}. Nevertheless, concerns were expressed by some regarding the lack of attention paid to social concerns during the introduction of the product, as well as not taking into account the variability in yield in the reports of success { | Dowd-Uribe, 2014 | | |zu:5334702:9LKSENMC}{ | Luna, &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:D3KFZUEE}{ | Luna, &amp; Dowd-Uribe, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:D3KFZUEE}. By 2012–2013, cotton companies noted that problems with fiber quality were observed { | Bourgou, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:IYILL2LE}. This is a concern because  Burkina Faso typically produces cotton that commands a premium price due to the length of the fiber. The loss of premium price was exacerbated by global oversupply and consequent overall price decrease for the commodity { | Bourgou, et al., 2020 | | |zu:5334702:IYILL2LE}.  Consequently, by 2016 the planting of Bt cotton in Burkina Faso was suspended. There is no regulatory ban on the variety, leaving open the door for re-introduction of the product when the problem with fiber length is solved through conventional breeding.
