\f0\fs22 \cf0 Regulatory restrictions on GM crops in Europe is especially evident in the extent of authorization for cultivation of these crops, but not as severely in authorizations for their importation for food, feed and processing. Because of the regulatory system in Europe, authorization for growing GM crops is granted at the European Union level, but individual member states can make a decisions on whether those crops are allowed to be grown in their jurisdiction. Authorization to grow GM crops has been difficult to obtain in Europe, with only eleven products (\'93events\'94

However, only one event, an insect-resistant maize (event MON810), is currently being grown in two member states, Spain and Portugal, but prohibited by others. Spain has been cultivating this event since 1998, and Portugal since 2012 \{ | Brookes, 2019 | | |zu:5334702:8A9PIIHU\}\{ | Brookes & Barfoot, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:UAFXALTY\}\{ | Fernandes, et al., 2014 | | |zu:5334702:RDBEKX7J\}\cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
. In the past, MON810 was grown in as many as four of the EU member states during 2015 and 2016 but by 2017 only in Spain and Portugal continued this cultivation \{ | Rostoks et al., 2019 | | |zu:5334702:8PMDG9RJ\}. Some have argued that the restrictions on GM crops has had a negative impact on European agriculture \{ | Stanciu, & Sarbu, 2019 | | |zu:5334702:VUZKPERP\}. Although cultivation of GM crops is limited in the EU, there are over 50 GM plant events that are authorized in the EU for food and feed import and processing

For Spain and Portugal, which have had experience with cultivation, the economic and environmental benefits have been documented. Brookes \{ | -Brookes, 2019 | | |zu:5334702:8A9PIIHU\} reported that in the 21 years since maize was \uc0\u64257 rst cultivated in on the Iberian peninsula in 1998, a total of 1.65 million hectares have been planted, with farmers bene\u64257 ting from an increase in income of \'80285.4 million, primarily due to higher crop yields. Insecticide spraying has also decreased by 678,000 kg of active ingredient, with inferred decreased in environmental impact and health. Kovak et al \{ |-Kovak, et al., 2021 | | |zu:5334702:BDHT2DEN\} calculate that cultivation of GM crops in Europe (soybean, maize, cotton, canola, and sugarbeet) could have reduced the region\'92s greenhouse gas emissions by 33 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents per year, or 7.5% of total EU agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 .\
Opposition to the authorization of these crops continues in the European Parliament, which as recently as November 4, 2020 adopted a resolution calling on the European Commission not to authorize placing on the market any GM plants containing genes that confer antibiotic resistance, which are often used as a selectable marker in the transformation process, which effectively would stop all imports of genetically engineered soybeans and maize\'97commodities that are key components of animal feed\'97into the EU \{ | European Parliament, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:PD4W7FUV\}.
