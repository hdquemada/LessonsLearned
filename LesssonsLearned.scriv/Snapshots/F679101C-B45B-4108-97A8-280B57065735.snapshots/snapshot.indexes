        <Text>A major source of opposition to GM crops in Europe is a view of agriculture that differs from countries such as the United States, where production of these crops is highest. The agricultural policy of the region is contained in its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which since 2010 has increasingly included elements that are designed to address environmental and social challenges in addition to production and market concerns, a direction that appears to align well with the wishes of the European public { | Pe'er, et al., 2019 | | |zu:5334702:E2GQYMZJ}. The CAP has played an important role in encouraging organic agriculture among its member stateshttps://www.organicseurope.bio/what-we-do/common-agricultural-policy-cap-post-2020/. Since organic standards prohibit the use of GM crops, in their production systems, there is strong political opposition to the introduction of these crops from this prominent sector.

The agricultural policy of the European Union is contained in its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which since 2010 has increasingly included elements that are designed to address environmental and social challenges in addition to production and market concerns, a direction that appears to align well with the wishes of the European public, despite the conflicting goals of agricultural productivity and environmental concerns represented by different committees contributing the formulation of that policy  { | Pe'er, et al., 2019 | | |zu:5334702:E2GQYMZJ}. A major feature of the CAP, direct payments to farmers, amounted to almost 70% of the budget for implementing the policy in 2017 { | Pe'er, et al., 2019 | | |zu:5334702:E2GQYMZJ}. Consequently, it can be argued that the European agricultural policy does not provide strong incentives for efficient agricultural production.

"Free-market competition arising from cheaper agricultural produce from the United States directly threatened Europe’s aspirations of enlarging its economic and geopolitical footprint further east." { | Juma, 2016 | | |zu:5334702:IWZH9ZVD}

The Farm to Fork strategy for agriculture, part of the European Green Deal  { | European Commission, 2020 | | |zu:5334702:ZI9JC3CM} gives further prominence to environmental concerns in European production agriculture relative to agricultural policies in other parts of the world. This strategy includes a concern that places where food is sourced also adheres to the same standards, in order that unsustainable practices are not simply moved to other regions. African countries are especially subject to the policies implemented in Europe, due to the size of the market that the latter represents. This has resulted in decisions made by African countries that might seem detrimental to the wellbeing of their people, but were probably shaped at least in part by the economic power of the European market (see Box 2).

￼

European attitudes about agriculture influenced decisions in Africa, even though food security in Europe is significantly greater that in Africa. Similarly, the malaria burden in Europe is minimal in relation to that in Africa (Cite WHO malaria incidence in Europe vs. Africa. Public attitudes toward gene drives in Europe currently is overwhelmingly critical of gene drives { | Duboua-Lorsch, 2021 | | |zu:5334702:596V4V8H}, with 70% opposed to the release of gene drive organisms into the environment, and that any release of these organisms should be postponed until they are proven harmless to biodiversity, health, agriculture, or peace. https://www.pollinis.org/admin/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resultats-sondage-forcage-genetique.pdf Be careful here: the poll questions are questionably leading.</Text>
