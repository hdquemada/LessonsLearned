GM Science Review, 2004

By 2004, GM crops were grown extensively in North and South America,
and in China,
but not in Europe.

The British government went to great lengths to provide scientific and ethical support for growing GM crops.
However, this did not sway public opinion.

Scientists did not realize that the public views risk very differently from them.

NGOs have also been very skillful about their messaging.

The benefits of the technology were not obvious to the average consumer.

Since there was not compelling reason to support the technology,
the easiest course of action was to be precautionary.
